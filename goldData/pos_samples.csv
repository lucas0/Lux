http://www.emergent.info/bruno-mars-michel-jackson-son-hoax	Claim: A DNA test proved that Bruno Mars is Michael Jackson's son	false	['Bruno Mars', 'Celebrity Deaths', 'Fake News', 'Hoaxes']	empirenews.net	http://empirenews.net/dna-results-confirm-michael-jackson-is-biological-father-of-bruno-mars/	2015/01/05	DNA Results Confirm Michael Jackson Is Biological Father Of Bruno MarsPosted on| Like 0NEW YORK, New York – Vladimir Kershov, publicist of R&B singer Bruno Mars, has been fired today after he revealed a shocking secret regarding the pop and R&B singer. Kershov leaked private information that revealed that Michael Jackson is Mars’ biological father.In a statement emailed to news and media outlets across the world, Kershov revealed that he was told by the singer that DNA testing had proven that Jackson, known across the world as the King of Pop, was without a doubt his biological father. After pleading with Mars, born under the name Peter Hernandez, to go public with the revelation, Mars refused to do so. Kershov insisted that it be made known to the public, and that the news would catapult the singer’s fame and boost record sales. Mars remained adamant that the information not be released. According to Kershov, he then took it upon himself and emailed the shocking news to media sources all over the world.“DNA testing has proven that Michael Jackson is the biological father of Bruno Mars,” Kershov said in the statement. “Against his wishes, I have decided to relay this message for the greater good and betterment of Bruno’s life and extravagant music career.”In a statement released by Mars’ new publicist, Jacqueline Pryor, it has been announced that Kershov was immediately fired by the singer, and may seek legal action against his former publicist. “The job of a publicist is indeed to better the career of their clients by persuading them to take part in things that cause their popularity to grow, however, the client must trust their publicist. The artist has the final say, no matter what.”When asked about the validity of Kershov’s statement, Pryor surprisingly made it clear that the information is accurate. “It is true. Doesn’t mean he was right in saying so, but it is true. When it comes to 29-year-old Bruno Mars, Michael Jackson is the father!”	1.0
http://www.emergent.info/smaller-Apple-Watch-edition-price	Claim: The smaller gold Apple Watch Edition will cost $7,999 USD.	false	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Edition', 'Apple Watch Price', 'Grail Watch', 'Stephen Foskett']	grail-watch.com	http://grail-watch.com/2015/02/16/gold-apple-watch-edition-must-cost-10000/	2015/02/16	b'The Apple Watch is a fairly large chunk of gold!Get ready for the tech press to flip out when Apple announces the retail price for the gold Apple Watch Edition model. Apple critics have always roasted the company for selling productsA that are more expensive than they should be, and they frequently use this as a wedge topic to criticize buyers. But the 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition will set a whole new bar with a sales price of $10,000. The funny thingA in this case is that Apple is perfectly right to be charging that much!Do you disagree? Check out my counterpoint, The Case Against the $10,000 Gold Apple Watch EditionGold is ExpensiveLets start with a little backgrounder in gold.A Everyone has a vague sense that gold is expensive. Even rabid Internet trolls have seen the banner ads and heard about that in the news. But most people dont understand just how expensive even a little bit of gold is.A So this is a good place to begin the discussion.Update: My calculations were wrong!A Also, this was a bit back of the envelope. Now that it has some readership I realize I should go back andA fix the calculations inA theA article to be more realistic...Here are the basic facts:Gold currently sells for between $1,200 and $1,300 per troy ounce and has been over $1,000 per troy ounce for the last five years.18-karat gold contains 75% pure gold, and that term is regulated by law.One ounce of 18k gold occupiesA about 1.8 cubic centimeters of volume since a typical 18-karat gold alloy weighs about 16.5 grams per cc.18-karat gold currently sells for $29.11 per gram, $905 per troy ounce, or $480 per cc..25 ccA of 18k gold is about enough to construct a watch buckle and .75 cc gets you a deployant clasp. It takes a few more to build a watch case, anywhere from 1.5 to 8A cc depending on the size and thickness of the case. So the buckle is worth $120-$360 and the watch case $720 to $3800 just as raw gold. This is why gold watches generally sell for a lot more than $6,000!Gold Watches are ExpensiveLets apply this to a watch case. Imagine you wanted to create a rectangular case 42 mm high by 36 mm wide by 10 mm deep. If it was solid, this would equalA 15.12 cc of volume. But its a watch case, so you have to leave room for the movement, dial, case back, etc. So letsA just leave 5 mm of thickness all around, making a hollow rectangle. This equals 6.8 cc (42 x 36 x 10  32 x 26 x 10). Therefore, the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost $3,200A as of this writing.A simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18-karat gold would costA more than $3,200Now lets consider the same shapeA but just 2 mm thick. Thats 2.9 cc of gold, worth $1,400. Pick your thickness and youre still looking at thousands of dollars worth of gold.How does this translate in the real world? Lets look at the retail price of some watches thatA are available in both stainless steel and 18-karat gold.This Cartier Tank MC is $15,000 more in 18k goldThe Cartier Tank MC measures 44 mm by 34 mm by 9.5 mm thick: $15,000 extra (list) for 18k goldCartier Tank MC in stainless steel: $7,000 list, $5,800 streetCartier Tank MC in 18k pink gold: $22,000 list, $18,200 streetTheA Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime measures 50.5 mm by 34.9 mm by 14 mm thick: $14,750 extra (list) for 18k goldJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in stainless steel: $8,550 list, $6,800 streetJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in 18k pink gold: $23,300 list, $18,400 streetThis list could go on and on, but the gist is simple: 18-karat gold cases cost a lot more than stainless steel. In fact, its pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under $10,000 in any size and from any manufacturer. Even tiny quartz ladies watches like the tiny Chopard Happy Sport Mini sells for $11,000! Most of the bargains commenters have pointed to are either 14-karat or less, very slim and small, or long out of production and with outdated pricing.Then theres the bracelet. SwapA a gold bracelet for a leather strap and you are looking at an extra $20,000. Adding a gold bracelet to thatA Jaeger-LeCoultre bumps the price to $42,900!Certainly there is quite a bit of profit in luxury watches, but one simply cannot deny the raw material valueA in a gold watch case. And the gold market is liquid like stocks and other commodities: There are plenty of buyers and sellers of gold, and plenty of reserves, so no company, no matter how strong, can expect favorable pricing from their suppliers.Another reason companies charge so much for gold watches and jewelry is as a hedge against volatility. They cant priceA near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long. So they generally price somewhat higher than they would, even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials, labor, distribution, and profit in a watch.The Apple Watch Edition Will Cost $10,000Theres a reason I picked those twoA watches for my comparisons: Both are similar in size and shape to the 42 mm Apple Watch. The Cartier is a little smaller and theA Jaeger-LeCoultre is a little larger, but bothA represent a traditional watchmakers gold-cased square-ish offering in the space. And both cost more than $20,000, with much of that price going to the gold case and matching buckle. And Jony Ive recently said that the historic Cartier Tank was one of his inspirations for the Apple Watch design!Apple would be crazy to sell the Apple Watch Edition for $20,000, though. ThatsA not going to happen. So theyre likely to find ways to reduce the cost dramatically.First, as we can see, the Apple Watch case is highly rounded in all three dimensions. Although questionable from an estheticA standpoint, this reduces the amount of material required by quite a lot.A Second,A Apple Watch has a large sapphire crystal front and back with the display, sensors, and such.A Third,A the interior frame is likely made of steel or aluminum, not gold, to reduce cost and increase commonality with the aluminum and steel versions.Could it be gold plated? No. Numerous reports state that it is a solid gold case. Although Apple has not apparently used the word, solid in their press releases, they do claim it is crafted from 18-karat gold andA nowhere does it say it is plated or gold filled (the industry term). There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple cannot break these any more than Tiffany could.Apple says that the Apple Watch will start at $349 for that aluminum Sport model, and many bloggers have reported the price for the steel Apple Watch to be roughly $1,000.A It is reasonable to assume that the gold Edition model will sell for substantially more than this, with many suggesting $4,000 or $5,000. But remember that this price would only cover 4 or 5 ounces of gold! Even with thin walls and a steel frame, its hard to see how Apple could make a solid 18-karat gold case and buckle for a 42 mm watch with just 3 ounces of gold.Gold is soft, but Apple claims that their special gold isA twice as hard as standard gold.A Taking that at face value, perhaps they reduced the thickness of the case commensurately, cuttingA the amount of gold in half versus a standard rectangular watch. This still leavesA a few thousand dollarsA of material value in the case.A The Apple Watch Edition will come in 38 mm and 42 mm sizes, a difference of about 20% in terms of case volume. So the smaller model could sell for 20% less still.My prediction is that the 42 mm Apple WatchA Edition will retail for $9,999 with the 38 mm Apple Watch Edition retailing for $7,999. This covers the cost of the gold case, the internals, manufacturing, sales, and profit, and yet does not leave AppleA subsidizing the world gold market by selling at a discount or cheating with a too-thin or plated case. I will be shocked if the price is $4,999, but I suppose its possible with some finagling and if thats the smaller model. And it will not be any less than that.This is a $10,000 productBonus prediction: Given the very high price of the Apple Watch Edition, I predict that availability will be quite limited. Apple will likely create special store-within-a-store spaces inA certain Apple Store locations for the Edition.A I further expect them to open special standalone Apple Edition Boutiques to sellA theA Watch Edition, accessories, and perhaps other future high-end products.Update!Needless to say, many people disagree with me. And now that @Gruber Fireballed this post,A I imagine Ill hear from lots of them real soon!The gist of theA disagreement lies in the amount of gold neededA for theA watch case. I assumed it would be quite thick (read sturdy) and would contain upwards of 130 grams of 18k gold. Then theres the strap lugs and buckle which would likely contain another few dozen grams. But @GAK_PDX A (and others, though he was most visually eloquent) suspects it contains much less gold.For fun, I took my Apple Watch models and used SW and some basic assumptions to figure the gold content. 29.16g: pic.twitter.com/WGEnjtj1Yh Greg Koenig (@gak_pdx) February 19, 2015I think this number is way too low, but its a good lower bound if the case was very thin and completely hollow. And it puts the raw gold at about $849A at $29.11 per gram of 18k gold. Although this is admittedly much, much lower than my estimate, it still illustrates my point that the Apple Watch Edition is not going to be cheap. And I think hes way off but time will tell who is right and who isA wrong.Another argument is based on this 2006 analysis of a gold Rolex watch. Right off the bat one should point out that gold cost $400/oz when it was written and that watch includes a gold bracelet as well, something Apple is apparently not going to do with the Edition.A That Rolex case contained 18.5 grams of gold alloy, but its much, much smaller than the Apple watch and its circular to boot! A 34mm circleA is 107mm in circumference, while the 42mm Apple Watch is 156mm in circumference.A Use the magic of math to scale theA Rolex up into a 42mm rectangle and were at 27.75 grams. But that caseA is also much thinner since we excluded the bezel, and the Apple Watch is pretty slab-sided. So we can probably double this safely and come out withA $1,615 of gold in my mangledA square Rolex case.So there are lower estimates than mine for the amount and value of the gold. I can accept that. But lets take a step back andA think about the final price.A Even if it contained less than $1,500 of gold, how much would it sell for? Certainly not $2,000 or $3,000. You still have to account for the cost of everything else, plus the intangibles of manufacturing and distribution. And profit for Apple (and a hedge against theA volatility of the price of gold). So were back at the $4,000-$5,000 estimate others have made. As Greg Koenig tweeted, and Forbes reported, If anyone thinks Apple is charging less than $5k for the Edition, they are smoking crack.Regardless of the total, its important to realize that the price of gold is in the drivers seat when it comes to pricing the Apple Watch Edition.Id love to be wrong,A and I look forward to updating this piece.

http://www.emergent.info/Texas-Sharia-law	Claim: A jurisdiction of Texas is now under Sharia law	false	['Dallas', 'Sharia Law', 'Texas']	breitbart.com	http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2015/01/27/hold-islamic-tribunal-confirmed-in-texas-its-voluntary-says-attorney/	2015/01/29	Islamic Tribunal Confirmed in Texas; Attorney Claims ‘It’s Voluntary’Islamic Tribunal Websiteby Bob Price 27 Jan 2015 027 Jan, 201527 Jan, 2015An Islamic Tribunal using Sharia law in Texas has been confirmed by Breitbart Texas. The tribunal is operating as a non-profit organization in Dallas. One of the attorneys for the tribunal said participation and acceptance of the tribunal’s decisions are “voluntary.”Breitbart Texas spoke with one of the “judges,” Dr. Taher El-badawi. He said the tribunal operates under Sharia law as a form of “non-binding dispute resolution.” El-badawi said their organization is “a tribunal, not arbitration.” A tribunal is defined by Meriam-Webster’s Dictionary as “a court or forum of justice.” The four Islamic attorneys call themselves “judges” not “arbitrators.”El-badawi said the tribunal follows Sharia law to resolve civil disputes in family and business matters. He said they also resolve workplace disputes.In matters of divorce, El-badawi said that “while participation in the tribunal is voluntary, a married couple cannot be considered divorced by the Islamic community unless it is granted by the tribunal.” He compared their divorce, known as “Talaq,” as something similar to the Catholic practice of annulment in that the church does not recognize civil divorce proceedings as ending a marriage.He also said there is a difference between how a man and a woman can request a divorce under their system. “The husband can request the divorce directly from the tribunal,” El-badawi stated. “The wife must go to an Imam who will request the divorce for her.” He called it “two paths to the same result.” The practice of Khula is the process where a wife can initiate a divorce proceeding and where the husband can agree to the divorce in exchange for a financial compensation. It appears the wife must agree to give up any claim to the “dower” that was not already paid or to return it if it has already been paid. Once the financial issues are resolved the husband can then proclaim the Talaq (divorce).El-badawi said they follow Texas family law when it comes to child support, visitation, and custody. He said that in most cases, custody of children is awarded to the mother.Breitbart Texas asked what happens when there is a conflict between Sharia law and Texas law. El-badawi said most of the time, the laws are in agreement. When pushed further he admitted that, “we follow Sharia law.” However, he explained, “If the parties are not satisfied with the tribunal’s decision, they do not have to accept it and they can take the matter to Texas civil courts.” He did not say what the social ramifications of rejecting the “judge’s” decision would be.The website for the Islamic Tribunal states, “The courts of the United States of America are costly and consist of ineffective lawyers.  Discontent with the legal system leads many Muslims in America to postpone justice in this world and opt for an audience on the Day of Judgment.”It goes on to state, “It is with this issue that Muslims here in America are obligated to find a way to solve conflicts and disputes according to the principles of Islamic Law and its legal heritage of fairness and justice in a manner that is reasonable and cost effective.”In explaining Sharia law, the website states, “Stoning adulterers, cutting of the hands, polyandry and the like (all can be traced in the relevant literature and can be explained in their Islamic legal mentality and rational context in fairness and justice), are mainly a part of Islamic Criminal Law.  In fact criminal law within Islam only makes up a fraction of the Shari’ah.  It is unscholarly and unfair to generalize that type of understanding, that is Criminal Law, to compromise the whole of Islamic law if we stick to speaking in technical terms.”The website lists four “ judges :” Imam Yusuf Z.Kavakci, Imam Moujahed Bakhach, Imam Zia ul Haque Sheikh and Dr. El-badawi. It states the Islamic Tribunal resolves business disputes, divorce (Talaq) cases, community problems, serious family problems, and Khula.El-badawi restated several times that participation in the tribunal is voluntary. However, he would not discuss what happens to someone who did not follow their rulings.Bob Price is a senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas and a member of the original Breitbart Texas team.

Currently, the Big Mac has a whopping 550 calories and 29g of fat. The Apple pie contains 250 cal, and it would take a full 69 minute to walk that off! With that being said, those two menu items were not a tough decision for elimination.McDonald’s is currently testing out a new version of their slim down menu in Delaware, Little Rock, Waco, Bakersfield, Macon and Knoxville. They plan a full nationwide rollout beginning February 1, 2015.One notable “ingredient” – preservatives – might also be eliminated from the menu altogether. Mark Andrés, President of McDonald’s USA, sparked widespread speculation when he asked investors, “Why do we need to have preservatives in our food?” And then answered himself with a “We probably don’t.”What do you think about this new menu transformation at McDonald’s?

They know who’s being naughty, and who’s being really naughty, things that even extensive online snooping couldn’t provide. Dildos, vibrators, chains — all the things stashed in closets and under beds.”Sources told reporters these were previously inaccessible to the government’s leading intelligence agency, if the owners paid cash at least.“If you want to know why the ‘privacy advocates’ have settled down, and moved on? My guess is, blackmail. These elves have accumulated petabytes of evidence against pretty much everybody,” Snowden said.“You wouldn’t believe what perverse things people will do to each other, right in front of these things,” Snowden concluded. “It’s why ‘ElfMonitor’ is such a highly sought after duty assignment.”Recommended For You:	1.0
http://www.emergent.info/human-death-GMO	Claim: Doctors confirmed the first case of death by genetically modified food	false	['Fake News', 'Hoaxes', 'World News Daily Report']	worldnewsdailyreport.com	http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/doctors-confirm-first-human-death-officially-caused-by-gmos/	2015/03/09	b' Share191K TweetMadrid| Doctors of the Carlos III hospital confirmed this morning in a press conference, the first case of human death caused by the ingestion of genetically modified food. Juan Pedro Ramos died from anaphylaxis after eating some recently developed tomatoes containing fish genes, which provoked a violent and lethal allergic reaction. This surprising announcement comes after the autopsy of the 31-year old Spanish man who died  at the Madrid hospital in the beginning of January. The young mans health rapidly deteriorated after he suffered an unexplained allergic reaction, and all the drugs used to refrain the anaphylaxis were entirely inefficient. The team of experts claims to have been able to determine that the genetically modified tomatoes that the victim ingested at lunch were the cause of the allergic reaction that caused his death.Mr. Ramos was working as a clerk in a Madrid warehouse on January 7, when he started feeling ill just after lunch. A number of symptoms started to manifest themselves, including a violent itchy rash, some serious swelling of the throat and a drastic drop in blood pressure. The man, who was known to have allergies, quickly injected himself some epinephrine, but his health condition continued to deteriorate.The young man was rapidly carried to the hospital by co-workers, but the medical staff was unable to identify the cause of his allergic reaction in time and none of the usual treatments or drugs seemed to work. Mr. Ramos was confirmed dead just over an hour after arriving at the hospital.The young man appeared happy and healthy when this picture was taken by his roomate, less than 24 hours before he died.The medical examiners and forensic experts at the Carlos III hospital had to execute a lot of tests and analysis before they could precisely determine what caused Mr. Ramos to die of an allergic reaction to seafood,  since all he had eaten before his death was a bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich with a diet cola. They were astonished when they discovered that the tomato he had ingested, not only contained some fish-related allergens, but also some antibiotic resistant genes which had prevented Mr. Ramos white blood cell from saving his life.At first we thought that there had been some form of contamination of his food, from contact with fish or seafood during the preparation explained Dr. Rafael Perez-Santamarina. It was only when we tested the tomato itself that we noticed that it contained some allergens usually found in seafood. We did many different analysis and they all confirmed that the tomato was indeed the source of the allergens that killed Mr. Ramos. Many experiments on GMOs had produced some horrible tumors and event death in rats and other lab animals, but most genetically modified products on the market were considered to be harmless to humans.The case of Mr. Ramos is the first human death officially confirmed to be linked to the ingestion of genetically modified food. It contradicts most studies on GMOs which had concluded that genetically engineered crops currently on the market were completely safe to eat.A team led by University of Nebraska scientists had anticipated this kind of problem in 1996, when they found that a Brazil nut protein introduced to improve the nutritional quality of genetically modified soybeans was able to provoke an allergic reaction in people with Brazil nut allergies. However, this kind of problem was dismissed by most scientists as very improbable, since it could easily be avoided with proper safety testing. The soybean injected with the Brazil nut gene was indeed abandoned during development, but it seems that the genetically modified tomato that caused Mr. Ramos death had not been submitted to sufficient testing and the lethal risk had not been identified before it was marketed.The Spanish ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality ordered for the tomatoes of Portugese origin which infected the young man, to be recalled and removed from stores and markets for safety reasons. More than 7000 tons of tomatoes will therefore be ceased across the country by ministry inspectors and public safety officials.The ministry also issued a public statement about the death of Mr Ramos in which it sends its condolences to his family and adds that it will immediately demand further research on the subject to determine if other genetically modified food products on the European market could represent a risk for the Spanish population.

/* ]]> */												Over the course of investigating the Apple Watch, I’ve spoken to several sources who have spent extended time with it. There are a lot of interesting details, some of which we’ll get into. But, by far, the biggest recurring theme is how little you use your iPhone once you have one. After these discussions, it seems certain that the Apple Watch will shortly be the primary way you access your iPhone during the day. People that have worn the Watch say that they take their phones out of their pockets far, far less than they used to. A simple tap to reply or glance on the wrist or dictation is a massively different interaction model than pulling out an iPhone, unlocking it and being pulled into its merciless vortex of attention suck. One user told me that they nearly “stopped” using their phone during the day; they used to have it out and now they don’t, period. That’s insane when you think about how much the blue glow of smartphone screens has dominated our social interactions over the past decade. There are a few ways Apple is making this happen. Stay On The WatchThe Watch will have more context about you than a phone alone ever could. For example, it takes your heart rate periodically, providing you with a last-checked time, which could offer major benefits to health applications and other contextual processes. Here’s a tidbit you might not know — in order to receive notifications from apps, the Watch must be on your wrist and locked. The Watch requires contact with your skin to receive notifications. There will be no in-app dropdown notifications or constant pinging while it’s off your wrist. Push notifications also cease when the battery reaches 10 percent. Those decisions speak to the care with which Apple is handling notifications. The notifications are also different at an elemental level than the ones on your phone — both on the developer and user side of things. These are seen right away rather than at some point. You act on them quickly and they don’t stack up like they do on the phone. There is that added bit of context because you know exactly when they got it, which means that time-sensitive notifications like those that recommend a precise establishment or ping you during a live event become much more germane. One user told me that they nearly “stopped” using their phone during the day; they used to have it out and now they don’t, period. If you’re a developer who deals with notifications you know how powerful that could be. And, as a user, those notifications activate as part of the app right on the Watch home screen, allowing you to act on them without any sort of sliding, unlocking or other junk. These are immediate, actionable items that you can access without the obligations inherent in taking out your phone. MechanicsBecause the screen of the Watch is so small, there has been a lot of talk about its use as a “notification window.” Yes, notifications are a powerful part of it, but the mechanics of the device actually support much, much more than that. People that have used the Watch extensively say that the touch targets are actually very precise and sensitive. This means that you will be able to trigger smaller buttons and interactive elements fairly easily. (As a note, the unusual clustered home screen layout means that the “hot” spots for apps will be at the edges, rather than the center. This way you can jet out to the edge of a group in any direction and find an app. Your “bottom row” will become your “outer ring.”)The display is also very sharp and easily readable from your wrist. When your attention is on the Watch, you’re going to want to do more there than you think, rather than having to move over to your phone. This means that you may find yourself reading short articles and other content on your wrist. This could affect the way that publishers want to build their apps. They shouldn’t just be redirection machines that punt people to their phones; there is an opportunity to give people what they need now and let them get back to what they’re doing. Battery life is also much better than some previous reports, so Apple has been working on it. In a normal day of on-and-off use, the battery usually ends up at around 25 percent, which means that you should be able to make it through a full day. It only takes around two hours to charge fully. The digital crown is an important part of the navigation process and has been matched precisely to the scroll velocity. This should give a sense of context that helps when viewing on the smaller screen, as you’re not chasing the scroll with your finger. It’s also changed physically since the Watch was first shown off, and now has more friction for a weightier, higher-end feel. Pressing and holding the crown activates Siri, which sources have said works incredibly well on the Watch. It can be used for labeling, directions, commands executed by the phone and more. If — and this is a big IF as Siri has been hit and miss over the years for me — if it is truly a “say it and forget it” experience, the confidence in using your wrist as a “commander” for your life is expansive. Why Watch? So, let’s discuss. Does it kind of suck that we have to buy a $500 accessory to return to a normal life? Sure. But such is the deal. You’re not going to give up your smartphone. That Faustian bargain has already been struck. We get access to an entire universe of information and communication and we sacrifice our bloody attention on its smooth glass altar. But the Apple Watch can return some of that attention and, more importantly, time back to you. If you argue the Watch isn’t going to sell or do well, it’s worth pointing out that there are very, very, very few products that allow you to hand someone cash and be given back TIME. This will be the Apple Watch metric to track: time saved. We’re getting a tad metaphysical here, but really the only resource we all have exactly in common is time. Kings don’t have more of it than peasants. Not everyone will be able to afford an Apple Watch (or even an iPhone), but if they’re in an economic situation where that’s feasible then they’re also in the situation where they are probably willing to trade money for time. And that is the target market of the Apple Watch. Not “rich people” (though there’s a model specially for them), not “tech geeks” and not “Apple fanatics.” It’s people who want more time, and that is a very large target. This, for some reason, is the thing that Apple has had a hard time articulating. This is the primary use case of the Watch. It’s not just that it’s a “notification center”; it’s that it allows you to act without any additional distraction. For now, the iPhone is a dominant business for Apple and the smartphone is a domineering force in our daily lives. But one day something will come along to destroy it. And, as Apple has expressed many times in the past, it is willing to be the one that finds that thing. With the Apple Watch, we could be seeing the beginnings of that process. Perhaps someday, the Apple Watch could do the impossible: it could make you stop using your phone.

http://www.emergent.info/gill-rosenberg-captured-isis	Claim: Canadian-Israeli Gill Rosenberg captured by ISIS while fighting with Kurdish forces	false	['ISIS']	jpost.com	http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Report-ISIS-kidnaps-former-IDF-Canadian-Israeli-soldier-who-went-to-fight-with-the-Kurds-383238	2014/11/30	"b'>Netanyahu: We wont tolerate Hamas or ISIS flags at protests in Israel>Profile of a freedom fighter: The Canadian-Israeli who joined the fight against ISIS>WATCH: How do American college students react to ISIS, Israeli flags?Share on facebookShare on twitterGila Rosenberg.(photo credit: FACEBOOK)Uncertainty abounds concerning the fate of Israeli-Canadian Gill Rosenberg, who was reportedly captured by Islamic State.Islamist websites  some of them known to be close to, or even serving as a front for, the terrorist  organization  reported Sunday that the 31-year-old adventurer was captured during fierce battles with Kurdish fighters in unspecified areas.Be the first to know -  Join our Facebook page. According to the websites, Rosenberg was taken hostage following three suicide attacks on sites where Kurdish fighters had barricaded themselves.The websites gave no further details regarding the circumstances of the capture, nor provided any proof of it.The Islamic State claims do not make clear whether Rosenberg was captured in Iraq or in Syria. The main battlefield between the Kurds and Islamic State is in the Syrian- Turkish border town of Kobani.Kurdish sources approached by Israel Radio reporter Eran Cicurel expressed doubt over the Islamic State report. They said Rosenberg was not in Kobani. In the assessment of these Kurdish sources, the reports of Rosenbergs capture are probably the terrorists propaganda.The Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) told The Jerusalem Post that there are no further details at this stage.Rosenberg wrote on her Facebook page on November 20 that she was handing over management of her account to someone else and would be without Internet access for at least two weeks, until December 8, she wrote. It is not clear where she went at this time.If the websites reports are true, Rosenberg would be the first confirmed Western female to fall into Islamic State captivity. Holding Israeli citizenship would complicate her situation even further.Unlike the US and the UK, which refused to negotiate over their respective captured nationals, thus giving the impression of a laissez-faire interest, Israel invests intense concern into the fate of its citizens captured by terrorists.This does not mean Israel will negotiate for Rosenberg, if she has indeed been captured  or that Islamic State would agree to talk with Israel, making her nationality Canadian alone.If Rosenberg is in captivity, she would be the second Israeli  of dual nationality  in this position. Steven Sotloff, a freelance American journalist who also held Israeli citizenship and filed for The Jerusalem Report on the Syrian civil war, was captured by Islamic State last year shortly after crossing the Syrian border and beheaded by the Islamist group this past August.As well, Rosenberg breached Israeli law by flying to Iraq, an enemy country, which Israeli citizens are forbidden to enter.No matter what has happened to her since joining the Kurdish forces, upon return to Israel she will be arrested and prosecuted, as was the case of several Israeli Arabs who joined Islamic State and subsequently returned to Israel.This is not Rosenbergs first tryst with adventurism  in 2009 she was arrested in an American con scandal and sentenced to four years in jail. This is, however, her first serious willful encounter with death.Rosenberg was born in Vancouver, and experienced a family crisis after her parents divorced. In an interview with Maariv in 2009, she said that already at the age of 22 she was pursuing a promising career as a pilot of Boeing passenger planes, but decided to leave everything behind and immigrate in 2006. In Israel, she joined the IDF, serving as an instructor for Kenyan soldiers who came to Israel for home front search and rescue training.Rosenberg said she had ambitions to join the Mossad, but was hurt during her military training and afterwards had money problems.She met an American friend in an ulpan Hebrew language course who led her into crime, she said.She joined a group of Israelis who were accused of setting up a ring to cheat elderly Americans and steal their money through a fake lottery scheme. According to the indictments filed against them, they stole hundreds of thousands of dollars, perhaps even millions, from the unknowing pensioners.After a number of complaints were filed, a joint Israel Police and FBI investigation was launched. The probe led to the arrest of several suspects and their extradition to the US, where they were tried. Rosenberg served four years in jail.She may have decided to fulfill an act of redemption after getting out of jail and regaining her freedom.Hopefully the Kurdish sources are right, and Rosenberg is indeed far from executioners.Canada is trying to confirm reports that Rosenberg has been captured, a foreign ministry spokesman said Sunday.Canada is pursuing all appropriate channels to seek further information and is in touch with local authorities, the spokesman said in a statement.Yossi Melman is an Israeli journalist and writer who specializes in security and intelligence affairs.

An inquiry was instituted against him in September, 1992 for major penalty for wilful absence from duty.Due to non-cooperation of Verma with the inquiry and for other reasons, it got delayed and a fresh charge sheet was issued in 2005.The inquiry report, establishing the charges was submitted in July, 2007 and the same was accepted by the then Minister of Urban Development in August, 2007. But no further action was taken in the matter.Seeking to streamline the functioning of CPWD and to ensure accountability, Naidu, soon after assuming office directed review of pending vigilance and disciplinary cases for expeditious action against the accused.Vermas case surfaced in due course and Naidu directed his dismissal from service.The Minister has taken serious view of in-action since 2007 and directed the concerned to fix responsibility for delay in the matterFor all the latest Delhi News, download Indian Express AppMore Related News\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNo use of blame game, PNB fraud was due to systemic failure, says Venkaiah Naidu\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFreedom of speech requires regulation to protect others rights: Venkaiah Naidu\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTags:Central Public Works DepartmentVenkaiah NaiduHhogachennJan 8, 2015 at 3:28 pmhahahaha...25 years it took to remove this roach??(0)(0) ReplyHhogachennJan 8, 2015 at 3:28 pmhahahaha...25 years it took to remove this man?(0)(0) Reply'	1.0

Staff at the animal shelter in Knyszynska Forest in Poland where she lives, had introduced a male snow owl into her enclosure to offer her company. However, two days later, her mate was found dead and half-devoured. Shelter spokesman, Robert Konowal said: ‘The first two days were fine and they seemed to get on very well. ‘We were horrified when we then discovered she had killed him. ‘At first we couldn’t understand why but we took the remains to a vet who after examining him found that his testicle sack and private parts were underdeveloped. For any Harry Potter fans out there, this may change your opinion of Hedwig who was also a female snowy owl.	1.0
http://www.emergent.info/apple-tv-hbo-now	Claim: HBO Now streaming subscription is coming to Apple TV	true	['Apple TV', 'HBO', 'International Business Times', 'Michael Learmonth']	ibtimes.com	http://www.ibtimes.com/hbo-talks-apple-be-launch-partner-coming-web-service-hbo-now-exclusive-1835882	2015/03/04	"By Michael Learmonth @learmonth On03/04/15 AT 2:28 PMGeorge R.R. Martin teased that some of the characters still alive in the books will die in ""Game of Thrones"" Season 5. Photo: Facebook/Game of ThronesHBO is in talks with Apple to make Apple TV a launch partner for its highly anticipated streaming service when it debuts next month. HBO and streaming partner Major League Baseball Advanced Media are working to have the standalone service, called “HBO Now,” ready to launch in April in conjunction with the premiere of the fifth season of “Game of Thrones,” according to sources familiar with the plan.When it launches, consumers will be able to subscribe to HBO Now directly from HBO for the first time, rather than through a cable, satellite or telco TV distributor such as Comcast or Verizon. The retail price is expected to be $15 a month when purchased directly from HBO, or about what consumers pay when they order HBO through their cable, satellite or telco provider.HBO’s corporate parent, Time Warner Inc., will rely on a whole new line of distributors (e.g., Apple TV, Roku, Xbox, PlayStation, Amazon, etc.) to help market HBO Now to an estimated 10 million U.S. broadband subscribers who do not pay for a cable TV bundle. CEO Jeff Bewkes has said the offering could also help reach some of the 70 million cable TV subscribers who do not subscribe to HBO but might if given the opportunity to subscribe online.HBO’s over-the-top service has been cast as the biggest challenge yet to the so-called cable bundle, in which consumers are required to buy packages of channels, some of which they may never watch. One study claimed the service would lead to a 7 percent drop in pay TV subscriptions , as users opt out of cable and opt in to HBO Now.Some cable providers, however, such as Cablevision and Cox Communications, have expressed interest in bundling HBO Now with broadband for their own subscribers who don’t get cable TV.Apple has been most aggressive in courting HBO in a bid to add the service to Apple TV, sources say. Apple TV already carries HBO Go for current HBO subscribers, but it may add a second app for HBO Now. Apple has spent the past several years negotiating for the rights to offer its own linear TV package; in the meantime, HBO Now is seen as an added service to drive adoption of Apple TV.While HBO has not confirmed a launch date for HBO Now, internally the target is an April launch, in time for the April 12 debut of “Game of Thrones.” That’s an aggressive time frame for Major League Baseball Advanced Media, which is building the back end along with a new front end separate from HBO Go. HBO is taking care not to launch HBO Now before it can guarantee that the service will work without some of the technical glitches that plagued HBO Go during last year's debut of cult-fave ""Game of Thrones.""The launch of HBO Now will be a milestone for Time Warner’s premium TV channel, which has for most of its 42-year history been distributed as an add-on to a package of cable channels. The Web service will allow HBO to sign on a new group of distribution partners, which it sees as no different than when it added satellite TV and, later, telcos such as Verizon and AT&T.Each of those distributors pays a wholesale price for HBO and then resells it to consumers for anywhere from $13 to $18 a month. Most see HBO as a retention device; those who subscribe are less likely to drop service or switch providers. HBO and Time Warner declined to comment.At $15 a month, HBO Now will be significantly more expensive than Netflix, which ranges from $8 to $12 a month for various levels of service, but cheaper than some were predicting. HBO makes the case that it has more original programming than Netflix and a better, more current film library. “It’s a premium product, and it will be priced accordingly,” HBO CEO Richard Plepler said during a Time Warner earnings call in February.HBO’s push to launch HBO Now comes after years of talking about launching an over-the-top service that bypasses traditional cable TV. Understandably, it has been met with some resistance from current distributors, including Time Warner Cable and Comcast, two companies in the midst of a $46 billion merger, according to sources.HBO, of course, heard the same misgivings from cable companies when it first added satellite TV providers and then telcos as distributors. HBO’s strategy is to give early partners a pricing advantage over newer ones; it’s unclear how this will go over with Apple, which has a track record of squeezing advantageous deals out of media, including the 99-cent single more than a decade ago.Bewkes said in December that he saw “cord-cutting” accelerate as pay TV providers dropped subscribers. U.S. pay TV providers lost 125,000 subscribers in 2014, according to Leichtman Research Group. At the same time, HBO and Cinemax reported their highest number of new subscribers (2.8 million) in 30 years.Among the challenges HBO faces to get HBO Now launched is how to avoid confusion with HBO Go, the service that allows HBO’s cable TV subscribers to access it on the Web, smartphones and tablets. The two services will have separate log-in pages and separate apps, but some cable execs are concerned about customer confusion. The explanation might challenge even the best call center employee: HBO Go is for TV subscribers to watch their content on devices; HBO Now for those who don’t subscribe via TV."	1.0

Scroll down for video   Diane DeJesus in her porn star days (left) and at her local gas station in Orlando recently (right). The Brazilian has been named by neighbours as the woman behind the massively popular DC Toys Collector YouTube account   DeJesus' videos, in which a mysterious woman 'unboxes' toys while narrating as she does so, have been watched a staggering 2.8billion times on YouTube, bringing the 29-year-old an annual income of almost $5m  The Brazilian went by the name Sandy Summers but is now living under the name Daiane de Jesus    Are these the hands of DC Toys Collector? Daiane DeJesus and her husband are apparently behind the site that has become a YouTube sensation   Seen here with a Teletubbies toy, the woman's nails always appear differently in each DC Toys Collector videoThe couple behind DC Toys Collector - previously known as 'Disney Collector' and one of the most popular videos on YouTube - has gone to extraordinary lengths to make sure their identities are not known.Attempts by the New York Times and BuzzFeed website to establish their identity failed, though they were able to pinpoint Florida as the location of those behind the channel - which is nothing to do with Disney itself.But Daily Mail.com has been told the identities of the pair by former neighbours and a close friend - and has used publicly available property records. Former neighbours who listened to the videos of DC Toys Collector are convinced that DeJesus is the voice behind You Tube's most successful channel.They became aware of her career as adult film star after she was spotted taking part in a photo shoot by the swimming pool in her back garden.RELATED ARTICLESPrevious1NextThe mystery woman who makes $5million from YouTube but...Giving the Nazi salute, chanting 'White Power' and pushing...Are you feline okay?

DeJesus and her partner Messias Credido's old home in Winter Park, Orlando, where porn films featuring DeJesus as Sandy Summers and some of what were known as the Disney Collector videos were both made   The DC Toys Collector formula is simple, with the woman simply removing the toys from their packaging, demonstrating each part and sometimes assembling them for the benefit of her massive online audience   The videos are essentially a virtual tour of each toy, such as this Play Doh with a Finding Nemo theme   Maribel Barreto, an associate and ex-wife of Daiane DeJesus' partner Messias Credido, was approached by Daily Mail.com and showed the photos of DeJesus and Summers. She said they are behind the DC Toys Collector videos   In the DC Toys Collector videos only the narrator's hands and the product being unboxed are usually seen   This still is from the channel's most successful video, which has been viewed more than 200million times  DeJesus' career change means neighbours say she is now the figure behind the most lucrative account on YouTube   The user unboxes everything from Disney princesses to tubs of Play-Doh, including this Cars themed toy'Her husband said he ran a photographic business but he never left the house. That was strange.'We just thought they were so secretive we thought something had to be going on.'Then someone said we should look at Sandy Summers' website and it all clicked into place.'His wife added: 'In the photo you have of Daiane she has put on a bit of weight but that is unmistakably her.'That is our former neighbour. I used to chat with her quite a lot and was shocked when I learned what she did and what might have been going on at the house.'Another neighbour, who is in his 70s and asked not be named, said no one in the quiet suburban street spoke to DeJesus or her husband about their work in the porn industry.'We heard what they did but it was none of our business,' he said.Credido's ex-wife Maribel Barreto was also approached by Daily Mail.com and viewed the photos of DeJesus and Summers. The effect [of DC Toys Collector] is somewhat akin to crack for toddlers because of how you see them pining for it after its over.'  When asked if DeJesus and Summers were the same person the 44-year-old went ashen-faced and hurried away.'I have nothing to say,' she said as she sprinted into her apartment.But Barreto, who was divorced in 2011, had earlier confirmed that her ex-husband and his wife Daiane ran the DC Toys Collector site from their home in Orlando.She said: 'Yes, they are the Disney Collectors. I can't say any more.'  While DeJesus has done nothing illegal, many parents who allow their children to watch the videos might be dismayed to learn about the other graphic videos and photo shoots DC Toys Collector apparently took part in a decade ago.Attempts by Daily Mail.com to speak with DeJesus and her husband have failed as they have no phone listing and they do not accept unsolicited callers to the gated community where they now live. Neighbours in the upscale gated community confirmed that they know the blonde woman who lives with Messias Credido as Daiane DeJesus.The couple, who have an 18 month old son, were married on December 26th 2013, according to records lodged with Seminole County Court.Credido, who is also from Brazil, is behind another successful You Tube site called BluCollector.    DeJesus as she is today, with the mole near her elbow showing she used to be the porn star Sandy Summers  DeJesus was formerly well known as an adult performer (left) but now keeps a far lower profile (right)   DeJesus as Sandy Summers by the fireplace thought to be at the Winter Park, Florida home    The 29-year-old once made risque videos but the market for her YouTube channel now is toddlersIt is identical to the DC Toys Collector channel except it focuses mainly on toys for young boys.Both the BluCollector and the DC Toys Collector site are produced in exactly the same way.Shipping receipts seen by Daily Mail.com show toys being sent from Germany to the home address of Credido.Former neighbours in the Orlando suburb of Winter Springs where DeJesus and Credido lived said they would see deliveries from UPS and Fed Ex almost daily at their home.'There would be delivery trucks up to three times a day. We all wondered what was going on and what was being dropped off,' said a neighbour.Credido has been named as the man behind the Blu Collector by other media outlets.But until now the identities behind DC Toys Collector have been a closely guarded secret.The videos first began appearing on YouTube in 2012.They quickly became an online sensation attracting millions of page views and popular with children aged three and under because of their simplicity.The most watched video is called 'Play Doh Sparkle Princess' and has had more than 200 million views.Five other videos have received more than 40 million views, and another 15 have more than 20 million.The channel's 1,600 videos have been watched more than 2.4 billion times since being uploaded.One of the most recent, called 'LUNCH BOX SURPRISE Magnetic Dress-Up FROZEN', has already notched up more than 260,000 page views.The DC Toys Collector channel has more than 3.7m subscribers with a new video posted almost every day.     DC Toy Collector's local Toys R US store where she buys some of the products she features on her channel   The branch of Target where Diane DeJesus sources some of the toys for her usually daily video postsLike others on YouTube, DC Toys Collector is able to make money from the site from pop-up and banner adverts on the site.With so many children watching the videos on a daily basis it is an obvious choice for companies advertising toys to place their adverts within the short videos.Each time the DC Toys Collector site is watched, the producers are paid.Industry experts say they get between .60cents and $5 each time the page is viewed.Google, which owns YouTube, takes 45 per cent of any money earned.The company Open Slate, which analyses YouTube, estimated that in 2014 DC Toys Collector earned $4.9m.They reached the figure by looking at the account's subscribers, social media reach and average monthly view count. I call it first-person toy porn. I think it works because it's Christmas morning every minute. In the videos DC Toys Collector's face is never seen. Viewers only ever see her hands and hear her slightly accented voice.Each video always begins with the words: 'Hey guys, Disney Collector here'.The narrator, who has a slight accent, regularly uses the words 'adorable' to describe the toys and carefully unwraps each item before explaining its features.The videos are expertly produced with professional sound and lighting.A focal point of the videos are the brightly coloured fingernails that often feature toy characters intricately painted on them.The videos are said to have an entrancing effect on children who sit mesmerized as the toys are slowly opened in front of their eyes.Technology strategist David Williams told the NBC Today show in July 2014 that the effect on kids, including his own, was like 'crack for toddlers'.He told the show: 'The effect is somewhat akin to crack for toddlers because of how you see them pining for it after it's over'.Williams also told Buzz Feed: 'I call it first-person toy porn. I think it works because it's Christmas morning every minute.'Others have called the DC Toy Collector 'The Toy Whisperer'.   The pool and backyard area at the Winter Park house, where Sandy Summers made some of her videos according to neighbours   The entrance to the gated community where  DeJesus lives and is thought to make her wildly popular toy review videos   DeJesus has been able to move to the exclusive area apparently thanks to DC Toys Collector making $5m a year    Disney World resort in Orlando, Florida, close to where DC Toys Collector has its headquartersBut the couple have gone to great lengths to guard their privacy. No phone number is listed and their names are not even on the phone entry system at the gated community where they now live in Orlando. Property records listed with Seminole County list 44-year-old Credido as the buyer of a four-bedroom home set on a cul de sac in Orlando in April 2013.DeJesus' name does not appear on the records.Neighbours in the development contacted by phone confirmed that DeJesus lives at the address and is mum to an 18-month-old boy. According to fan websites DeJesus, or Summers, began her porn career when she was 20 years old in 2006.She lists her hometown as Lages in Santa Catarina, Brazil, and her date of birth as April 1986.On a webpage called Babepedia she says: 'I was born in a small town in Brazil called Lages. I love the sun, so when I moved to the US Florida seemed like the right place.'I miss some of my friends in Brazil, but I just love living here! I enjoy the simple life, but big cities have so much to offer; shopping for one! I am a shopoholic, definitely!'I speak Portuguese and English. What else can I say about myself? Just that I love to get naked.'In her career she has appeared on the cover of Penthouse magazine and other adult magazines as well as dozens of graphic videos.It appears she quit or reduced her involvement in the adult film business in 2009 with one fan asking on a site: 'Anyone know what has happened to Sandy Summers?'   Daily Mail.com tracked down Daiane DeJesus' partner Messias Credido's former wife Maribel Barreto   Ms Barreto confirmed that Mr Credido and Daiane de Jesus are behind the DC Toys Collector videos. She is pictured being shown a document with the reported annual income of DC Toys Collector   But when asked if DeJesus and Summers were the same person the 44-year-old went ashen faced and hurried awaySome of the photographs of Summers on adult sites appear to have been taken at their home in Winter Park.Many of the backdrops in the pictures are identical to those now being shown on the estate agent's webpage advertising the home for sale.In one she is draped across a stone fireplace. That same fireplace is pictured on the estate agent's webpage advertising the home for sale.DeJesus and Credido, who ran a now defunct photographic business called High Tec Photography, lived in Winter Park for almost seven years.The couple aroused the curiosity of neighbours as they were ultra secretive.One said: 'Messias said he was a photographer but he never left the house. They always made sure that no one would come into the house.'They were friendly when you bumped into them in the street, but they would not go out of their way to be talkative.'Another said: 'Word soon got around that Daiane was involved in some sort of adult work. No one liked to ask any questions but once we knew her working name we looked her up.'Publically available records with Seminole County show that the couple moved in April 2013 from Winter Park to a gated community in Orlando, paying $690,000 for a four-bedroom home.Daily Mail.com knows the exact location but has declined to publish it. It is also possible that Ms Barreto works with the couple on the DC Toys Collector website or even plays the part of the hands herself. However, she claimed to DailyMail.com that the couple are behind the production of the videos.Credido has also recently paid $300,000 for a plot of land in another gated community where he is expected to build a multi-million dollar home.Records filed with Seminole County court show that DeJesus and Credido were married on December 26, 2013. DeJesus is listed as a single woman while Credido is divorced.Her birth date is listed on the official form as April 1982 - four years different that Summer's on adult film websites containing her biographyDaily Mail.com has attempted to speak with the couple but they have declined to return any calls.

/* ]]> */												Over the course of investigating the Apple Watch, I’ve spoken to several sources who have spent extended time with it. There are a lot of interesting details, some of which we’ll get into. But, by far, the biggest recurring theme is how little you use your iPhone once you have one. After these discussions, it seems certain that the Apple Watch will shortly be the primary way you access your iPhone during the day. People that have worn the Watch say that they take their phones out of their pockets far, far less than they used to. A simple tap to reply or glance on the wrist or dictation is a massively different interaction model than pulling out an iPhone, unlocking it and being pulled into its merciless vortex of attention suck. One user told me that they nearly “stopped” using their phone during the day; they used to have it out and now they don’t, period. That’s insane when you think about how much the blue glow of smartphone screens has dominated our social interactions over the past decade. There are a few ways Apple is making this happen. Stay On The WatchThe Watch will have more context about you than a phone alone ever could. For example, it takes your heart rate periodically, providing you with a last-checked time, which could offer major benefits to health applications and other contextual processes. Here’s a tidbit you might not know — in order to receive notifications from apps, the Watch must be on your wrist and locked. The Watch requires contact with your skin to receive notifications. There will be no in-app dropdown notifications or constant pinging while it’s off your wrist. Push notifications also cease when the battery reaches 10 percent. Those decisions speak to the care with which Apple is handling notifications. The notifications are also different at an elemental level than the ones on your phone — both on the developer and user side of things. These are seen right away rather than at some point. You act on them quickly and they don’t stack up like they do on the phone. There is that added bit of context because you know exactly when they got it, which means that time-sensitive notifications like those that recommend a precise establishment or ping you during a live event become much more germane. One user told me that they nearly “stopped” using their phone during the day; they used to have it out and now they don’t, period. If you’re a developer who deals with notifications you know how powerful that could be. And, as a user, those notifications activate as part of the app right on the Watch home screen, allowing you to act on them without any sort of sliding, unlocking or other junk. These are immediate, actionable items that you can access without the obligations inherent in taking out your phone. MechanicsBecause the screen of the Watch is so small, there has been a lot of talk about its use as a “notification window.” Yes, notifications are a powerful part of it, but the mechanics of the device actually support much, much more than that. People that have used the Watch extensively say that the touch targets are actually very precise and sensitive. This means that you will be able to trigger smaller buttons and interactive elements fairly easily. (As a note, the unusual clustered home screen layout means that the “hot” spots for apps will be at the edges, rather than the center. This way you can jet out to the edge of a group in any direction and find an app. Your “bottom row” will become your “outer ring.”)The display is also very sharp and easily readable from your wrist. When your attention is on the Watch, you’re going to want to do more there than you think, rather than having to move over to your phone. This means that you may find yourself reading short articles and other content on your wrist. This could affect the way that publishers want to build their apps. They shouldn’t just be redirection machines that punt people to their phones; there is an opportunity to give people what they need now and let them get back to what they’re doing. Battery life is also much better than some previous reports, so Apple has been working on it. In a normal day of on-and-off use, the battery usually ends up at around 25 percent, which means that you should be able to make it through a full day. It only takes around two hours to charge fully. The digital crown is an important part of the navigation process and has been matched precisely to the scroll velocity. This should give a sense of context that helps when viewing on the smaller screen, as you’re not chasing the scroll with your finger. It’s also changed physically since the Watch was first shown off, and now has more friction for a weightier, higher-end feel. Pressing and holding the crown activates Siri, which sources have said works incredibly well on the Watch. It can be used for labeling, directions, commands executed by the phone and more. If — and this is a big IF as Siri has been hit and miss over the years for me — if it is truly a “say it and forget it” experience, the confidence in using your wrist as a “commander” for your life is expansive. Why Watch? So, let’s discuss. Does it kind of suck that we have to buy a $500 accessory to return to a normal life? Sure. But such is the deal. You’re not going to give up your smartphone. That Faustian bargain has already been struck. We get access to an entire universe of information and communication and we sacrifice our bloody attention on its smooth glass altar. But the Apple Watch can return some of that attention and, more importantly, time back to you. If you argue the Watch isn’t going to sell or do well, it’s worth pointing out that there are very, very, very few products that allow you to hand someone cash and be given back TIME. This will be the Apple Watch metric to track: time saved. We’re getting a tad metaphysical here, but really the only resource we all have exactly in common is time. Kings don’t have more of it than peasants. Not everyone will be able to afford an Apple Watch (or even an iPhone), but if they’re in an economic situation where that’s feasible then they’re also in the situation where they are probably willing to trade money for time. And that is the target market of the Apple Watch. Not “rich people” (though there’s a model specially for them), not “tech geeks” and not “Apple fanatics.” It’s people who want more time, and that is a very large target. This, for some reason, is the thing that Apple has had a hard time articulating. This is the primary use case of the Watch. It’s not just that it’s a “notification center”; it’s that it allows you to act without any additional distraction. For now, the iPhone is a dominant business for Apple and the smartphone is a domineering force in our daily lives. But one day something will come along to destroy it. And, as Apple has expressed many times in the past, it is willing to be the one that finds that thing. With the Apple Watch, we could be seeing the beginnings of that process. Perhaps someday, the Apple Watch could do the impossible: it could make you stop using your phone.

http://www.emergent.info/marines-weapons-yemen	Claim: The final Marines to leave the U.S. embassy in Yemen handed their weapons over to Houthi rebels	false	['Fox News', 'Marines', 'Megan Kelly', 'Yemen']	breitbart.com	http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/02/11/report-marines-ordered-by-state-dept-to-surrender-weapons-in-us-embassy-evac-in-yemen/	2015/02/14	by Jeff Poor 11 Feb 2015 011 Feb, 201511 Feb, 2015**Update added (see below)**In a report that aired on Fox News Channel’s “The Kelly File,” host Megyn Kelly revealed U.S. Marines stationed to guard the U.S. Embassy in Yemen were instructed by the State Department to surrender their weapons to local authorities upon the evacuation of those facilities.“[L]ate last night, the State Department ordering all personnel in the U.S. embassy in Yemen to pack up and get out,” Kelly explained. “Last month an Iranian-backed rebel group overthrowing the U.S.-backed government — it’s a group which you can see here, is not particularly fond of the United States, as they chant “death to America.” And now they are consolidating power and the security situation for Americans is rapidly deteriorating. Now tonight a senior defense official confirming to Fox News that Marines were directed to turn over their weapons before they were allowed to leave. According to one source the order came from the U.S. State Department. That is generating some serious outrage tonight especially among Marines who are taught from day one never surrender your weapon. At least one Marine telling Fox News, ‘Blank yeah, it pissed me off.’ Pardon me, his term. ‘I’m not giving up my weapon to anyone.’”UPDATE:The U.S. Marine Corp denied the report in a statement released Wednesday night:The Marine Security Force left the American embassy in Yemen for the movement to the airfield as part of the “ordered departure” with only personal weapons. All crew served weapons were destroyed at the embassy prior to movement. None of them were ‘handed over’ in any way to anyone. The destruction of weapons at the embassy and the airport was carried out in accordance with an approved destruction plan.Upon arrival at the airfield, all personal weapons were rendered inoperable in accordance with advance planning. Specifically, each bolt was removed from its weapons body and rendered inoperable by smashing with sledgehammers. The weapons bodies, minus the bolts, were then separately smashed with sledgehammers. All of these destroyed components were left at the airport — and components were scattered; no usable weapon was taken from any Marine at Sana’a airport.To be clear: No Marine handed a weapon to a Houthi, or had one taken from him.Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poorRead More Stories About:Comment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

http://www.emergent.info/Boston-marathon-bomber-beaten	Claim: Boston marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was severely beaten in prison	false	['Bombing', 'Boston', 'Boston Marathon', 'Dzhokhar Tsarnaev', 'Fake News', 'Hoaxes']	empirenews.net	http://empirenews.net/accused-boston-marathon-bomber-severely-injured-in-prison-may-never-walk-or-talk-again/	2015/01/19	Boston Marathon Bomber Tsarnaev Severely Injured In Prison, May Never Walk Or Talk AgainPosted on| Like 0FORT DEVENS, Massachusetts – Infamous Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 22, was the victim of an “unfortunate accident” yesterday at Ft. Devens Detention Center in Massachusetts, just a few short months after his high-profile trial and sentencing, according to warden Paul Jacobson.Corrections officers reportedly found the terror suspect face down in a pool of his own blood in his cell; a banana peel was found on the floor nearby.“It initially appeared as though Tsarnaev slipped on a discarded banana peel and hit the floor with such force that his head bounced off the hard tile surface, probably 16 or 17 times. There was blood everywhere – all over the walls, the floor, even the toilet. The injuries have caused massive brain trauma,” said prison investigator Joe Goldsmith. “We determined though, through expert analysis, that it would be impossible for these injuries to have occurred through a fall. Our investigation has shown that that it was the Aryan Brotherhood who initiated an attack on Tsarnaev.”“Yes, it was the brotherhood who took care of that bomber,” said Miles Smith, head of the Aryan Nation inside Devens. “The other gangs, they wanted him, too. We paid the guards the most money to have a shot. They stood aside, and let us do what we do. On the way out, they shook our hands, told us ‘Thank you.’ Well, You’re welcome. You’re welcome, Boston. You’re welcome, America!”“Normally, an attack this violent, this cruel, on another inmate would get any offending party more time added to their sentence,” said warden Jacobson. “Because of the nature of Tsarnaev’s crimes, though, we have decided to actually reduce the sentences of the Aryan members who were involved. They have done our prison and our country a great service, and we appreciate it immensely. They are heroes in the eyes of not only this institution, but also in the eyes of the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.”Tsarnaev had pled not guilty to all thirty charges filed against him, but was found guilty on all counts in April. He was sentenced to the death penalty per the crimes committed. 	1.0
http://www.emergent.info/19-million-watches-in-2015	Claim: Apple will sell 19 million Apple Watches in 2015	unverified	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Sales', 'BMO Capital Markets', 'Keith Bachman']	appleinsider.com	http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/03/06/bmo-forecasts-19m-apple-watch-sales-in-2015-with-more-than-half-selling-in-holiday-season	2015/03/06	"By Neil HughesFriday, March 06, 2015, 05:45 am PT (08:45 am ET)Momentum for the Apple Watch will likely take a short time to build driven mostly by apps, one analyst believes, with sales quickly escalating to 10 million units in the holiday 2015 shopping season.Keith Bachman of BMO Capital Markets believe Apple will sell 19 million Apple Watch units in calendar year 2015, with more than half of those being sold in the December quarter. His prediction was issued in a new note to investors this week, a copy of which was provided to AppleInsider.Bachman is bullish on the Apple Watch, but he believes it will take some time for applications to be built that will truly sell the public on the upcoming wrist-worn device.His estimates suggest there will be an installed base of more than 484 million iPhone users as of December 2015. Sales of 19 million Apple Watch units would equate to 3.9 percent of the total user base.For fiscal year 2016, Bachman believes Apple will sell 36.5 million of the Apple Watch, growing to 10.9 percent of iPhone users by September of 2016.Bachman's confidence in the Apple Watch comes despite the fact that there is still much not known about the wearable. In particular, he's especially curious to find out final pricing, application availability, and battery life.Regarding the high-end price point, BMO's analyst isn't concerned if the 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition sells for more than $10,000. He suspects Apple will sell very few units at that price, as most high-end watch consumers will opt for a brand like Rolex that can stand the test of time.Bachman also isn't concerned about suspected battery life of around 24 hours. He noted that most consumers have become accustomed to recharging their iPhone at night by their bedside, and he expects Apple Watch users will do the same.BMO has maintained its price target of $135 for shares of AAPL, along with an ""outperform"" rating.Topics:"	1.0
http://www.emergent.info/Foley-ransom	Claim: The US threatened to prosecute the family of slain journalist James Foley	unverified	[]	abcnews.go.com	http://abcnews.go.com/International/government-threatened-foley-family-ransom-payments-mother-slain/story?id=25453963&singlePage=true	2014/09/23	"Video Appears to Show Beheading of US Journalist James FoleyNicole Tung/AP PhotoIn this Nov. 2012, file photo, posted on the website freejamesfoley.org, shows missing journalist James Foley while covering the civil war in Aleppo, Syria.Diane Foley told ABC News earlier this week that warnings over the summer came primarily from a highly decorated military officer serving on the White House's National Security Council staff. James Foley’s brother, Michael, also told ABC News that he was directly threatened with possible prosecution by a State Department official.“It was very upsetting because we were essentially told to trust… that the way they were handling things would bring our son home,” Diane Foley said.The U.S. government did try to rescue James Foley along with other American and European hostages from an ISIS stronghold in Syria in early July, but by the time the elite commandos arrived at the location, the hostages had been moved. Foley was executed weeks later by a self-professed ISIS militant.Digital GlobeThis satellite photo shows a compound on the Euphrates River just south of Raqqah, Syria where ISIS hostages, including James Foley, were believed to have been held in the Spring of 2014 based on descriptions by former hostages.Diane Foley said the family believed they knew where their son was being held prior to his execution, but other than the July rescue mission, it didn’t seem like anything was being done.“But we’re not politicians, we’re not government people, we don’t know,” she said. Diane Foley said the problem was that the family “had no idea” because the government didn’t tell them.At times, Diane Foley said the family “had to beg” the government for information on their son.“We were an annoyance, it felt, at some level… They didn’t have time for us,” she said.Today White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said that government officials were in constant contact with the Foley family and declined to comment on the alleged ransom warnings, telling reporters he’s “not going to be in a position to detail the kinds of conversations that took place so often between members of the administration and the Foley family.”“It is a long standing policy of this administration, it was the policy of previous administrations that ransoms should not be paid to terrorist organizations,” Earnest said before referring more specific questions about the Foley’s situation to the Justice Department .Secretary of State John Kerry today told reporters that he was “really taken aback [and] surprised” by Foley’s allegations. “I can tell you that I am totally unaware and would not condone anybody that I know of within the State Department making such statements,” Kerry said.State Department spokesperson Marie Harf today denied the State Department told the family they could be prosecuted for paying ransom, only that the department helps hostage families “understand what our laws are about terrorists or paying ransom to terrorists.”“But this department would never and did not ever intend nor do we think we ever did anything that we would consider threatening,” Harf said.Obtained by ABC NewsA screengrab from a video posted online appears to show American journalist James Foley shortly before he is killed by a masked captor.Thursday an NSC spokeswoman also said that the Foley family was informed of U.S. laws banning terrorism financing but denied the family was told they could face charges if they made a ransom payment.""Without getting into the details of our private discussions with families, the law is clear that ransom payments to designated individuals or entities, such as ISIL [ISIS], are prohibited. It is also a matter of longstanding policy that the U.S. does not grant concessions to hostage takers. Doing so would only put more Americans at risk of being taken captive. That is what we convey publicly and what we convey privately,"" NSC spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in a statement.The spokeswoman also asked ABC News to withhold the military officer's name for fear his personal security could be compromised by those who might wrongly blame U.S. officials for Foley's slaughter at the hands of ISIS militants who may never have considered sparing him for any price.Diane Foley did not disclose how much her family had raised before his high-profile public execution but she and a surviving son, Michael, said that the administration's intimidation tactics succeeded.""It slowed my parents down quite a bit. They didn't want to do anything that could get them in trouble. It slowed them down for months in raising money. Who knows what might have happened?"" Michael Foley said.The family launched the James W. Foley Legacy Fund this week, which in large part is intended to help other hostages' loved ones navigate the frustrating currents they encountered both with the terrorists and with their own government.Two American and several British hostages remain in ISIS captivity.Asked whether she had believed ISIS would accept a ransom payment and free their son, as they had many European hostages liberated for between $2-3 million each, Diane Foley replied, ""I do, maybe -- I mean, who knows?""""ISIS is a very brutal group. They may have already decided, that Jim and the others were Americans and they were going to kill him,"" Diane Foley said.In the end, Diane Foley said she didn't want to blame anyone for what happened to her son, but said that when it comes to the U.S. government’s treatment of the families of hostages, “As Americans, we can do better.”"	1.0
http://www.emergent.info/nhl-vegas	Claim: The NHL will announce an expansion to Las Vegas in 2014	false	['Las Vegas', 'NHL']	theprovince.com	http://www.theprovince.com/sports/Tony+Gallagher+Bettman+changed+tune+expansion/10150984/story.html	2014/08/27	Gallagher: Bettman has changed his tune on NHL expansionTony Gallagher (The Province)Updated: August 28, 2014  9:56 AMFiled Under:EmailNHL commissioner Gary Bettman says the National Hockey League will ‘listen to expressions of interest’ in adding teams.Photo by Mark HumphreyIt wasn’t very long ago that NHL commissioner Gary Bettman was treating talk of expansion as though he was being asked if he’d like an epidemic of Ebola.But recently the nature of the rhetoric has changed so much that the question is becoming not if, but when.And then the ultimate question. Will they be able to limit the number of new teams to just two?Sources close to the situation have indicated Las Vegas is a done deal, the only thing to be determined being which owner will be entitled to proclaim that he brought the first major league sports franchise to Sin City.And given how dead set against a team in the gambling haven the commissioner was 10 years ago, this move into another player friendly state-tax-free zone represents a considerable about-face indeed.But people have been betting on hockey games for years and to pretend games couldn’t be fixed just as easily anywhere as in Vegas is pretty ridiculous, so that posturing has fallen by the wayside.A new team close to the newly renamed Arizona squad and California’s big three is all but assured, the only question being when and with which other city. Or should that be plural?With all the activity going on in the Seattle area in the last little bit it would be quite a stretch to imagine that much time and effort being spent by so many wealthy men being frittered away for nothing.At the moment there are no surefire plans to build a new rink, but that could change at any time with Vancouver billionaire Victor Coleman among many reportedly showing interest in putting an NHL team into the city.And Bettman hasn’t been visiting there to see if it really does rain a lot.It’s been 15 years since the NHL expanded — and given there are 16 teams in the east and just 14 in the west, taking in two more teams would certainly seem to make a lot of sense, the same amount of sense it made when realignment was first announced.And expanding without the players getting their mitts on any of the money other than the increase in payrolls is surely tempting, at least to those owners who remember the hefty cheques they cashed for Columbus and Minnesota.Whereas before the commissioner balked at expansion, this is a sample of his more recent verbal footwork:“There’s a lot of interest. We’re hearing from multiple groups in Seattle and in Vegas and Kansas City and Quebec City,” Bettman said to the Tribune while scoping out Target field in Minny for yet another trip to the well of outdoor games.“We have not decided to engage in a formal expansion process but we listen to expressions of interest. It’s not something we’ve seriously considered yet.”Like hell it isn’t. They’d have to be nuts not to be thinking about it seriously.And since then things have changed for a commissioner who hates to move teams in his league no matter how dire the circumstances might appear — one of the most likable aspects of his regime for most hockey fans. Once the league comes to your area, it is going to stay through thick, thin and the almost impossible, as seems to be the case in Phoenix.But could that long-standing policy and loyalty change with the Florida situation? True there’s a lease until 2028, but with the Panthers bleeding money, even the city of Sunrise can’t seem to see the point of carrying on much longer, so perhaps one of these new cities could get an existing team after all.And while Kansas City isn’t really likely to be a serious contender in this expansion soup unless they’re going to stretch it to four teams, saying no to Quebec City in favour of two more U.S. cities with no proven NHL backgrounds is almost certainly not going to happen.Going back to Minnesota has been a success, and there’s no question there’s more money and corporate backing than ever before in Quebec. Even an expansion team there in a new arena would be virtually assured of sellouts into perpetuity.There will be all manner of bleating about there being insufficient talent, of course, but even if it’s true, after such a long wait this trivial detail — which only troubles the fans — isn’t going to get in the way of a financial windfall like this.And any time the league decides it could use talent, they can start doing away with most of the coaches they employ whose chief calling in life is to devise ways to stop offensive players and choke the very life out of the game that’s paying their salaries.Expansion will be happening, and soon. The only question is how many new cities will be involved.	1.0

http://www.emergent.info/macdonalds-overweight-customers	Claim: McDonald's will stop serving overweight customers	false	"['Fake News', ""McDonald's""]"	dailybuzzlive.com	http://dailybuzzlive.com/mcdonalds-will-stop-serving-overweight-customers-beginning-1115/	2014/12/19	McDonald’s Will Stop Serving Overweight Customers Beginning 1/1/15Posted onby Daily Buzz LiveMcDonald’s Will Stop Serving Overweight Customers Beginning 1/1/15. So how will McDonald’s define overweight?Obesity rates in America have more than doubled over the last 2 decades and has become the leading public health issue in the U.S. With more than two-thirds of the adult population overweight, McDonald’s has decided to become part of the obesity rate solution – not the problem.According to reports, beginning January 1, 2015, McDonald’s will no longer serve customers who show risks of being overweight. They will define overweight by these standards: Over 170 lbs for women and 245 lbs for men. Children’s weight restrictions will vary depending on age and height.McDonald’s is currently running campaigns to shake its “junk food” image, insisting they sell nothing but good quality food. They are are branding themselves from “A dining experience of fast food” to “Good food served fast.” They want people to understand the risks of being overweight.So how will they know if you are overweight ? Will they ask you what you weigh and trust your answer? NOThey are implementing scales at the from of every register just like the one in the photo below. You must stand on the scale when ordering or you will not be served. They also plan on posting signs to let customers know that they have the legal “Right to refuse service to anyone.” For drive-thru patrons it may be a bit more difficult to enforce. However, if the person looks like they exceed the weight restrictions, they will be refused service at the drive-thru window.	1.0
http://www.emergent.info/high-school-trader-worth-72-million	Claim: A N.Y. high schooler earned $72 million in the stock market	false	['NYC', 'Stock Market']	nymag.com	http://nymag.com/news/articles/reasonstoloveny/2014/mohammed-islam-stock-trading/	2014/12/15	"ShareThis(Photo: Bobby Doherty)Editor's Note: In the most recent edition of New York, its annual Reasons to Love New York issue, the magazine published this story about a Stuyvesant High School senior named Mohammed Islam, who was rumored to have made $72 million trading stocks. Islam said his net worth was in the ""high eight figures."" As part of the research process, the magazine sent a fact-checker to Stuyvesant, where Islam produced a document that appeared to be a Chase bank statement attesting to an eight-figure bank account. After the story's publication, people questioned the $72 million figure in the headline, which was written by editors based on the rumored figure. The headline was amended. But in an interview with the New York Observer last night, Islam now says his entire story was made up. A source close to the Islam family told the Washington Post that the statements were falsified. We were duped. Our fact-checking process was obviously inadequate; we take full responsibility and we should have known better. New York apologizes to our readers.Rumors, on Wall Street, can be powerful. A whisper can turn into a current that moves markets, driving a stock price up or sending it tumbling. There may be only one other place where gossip holds such sway, and that is high school.Late last year, a rumor began circulating at Stuyvesant that a junior named Mohammed Islam had made a fortune in the stock market. Not a small fortune, either. Seventy-two million.An unbelievable amount of money for anyone, not least a high-school student, but as far as rumors go, this one seemed legit. Everyone at Stuy knew that Mohammed, the soft-spoken son of Bengali immigrants from Queens and the president of the school’s Investment Club, was basically a genius.As the news spread, Mo’s stock went up. The school paper profiled him, Business Insider included him on a list of “ 20 Under 20 ,” and Mo became “a celebrity,” as his friend Damir Tulemaganbetov put it on a recent Friday night at Mari Vanna near Union Square. “A VIP!”Mo, a cherubic senior with a goatee and slight faux-hawk, smiled shyly. “He’s quiet today,” said Patrick Trablusi, who was seated with Mo and Damir at a table littered with empty glasses. “Humble.” And tired: “This is our third meeting of the day,” Damir said, signaling to the waitress for another round. “We saw a real-estate agent, a lawyer, you …”“Next we’re going to see a hedge-fund guy,” Patrick said. The friends locked eyes and started to giggle.“He basically wants to give us $150 million,” Mo explained, a blush like a sunset creeping over his cheeks.The waitress arrived with a tray of green drinks. “Freshly squeezed apple juice,” Damir said, passing them around. “It’s very good. Do you like caviar?”After Mo became a celebrity, things got a little awkward at school. (“Aren’t you the kid who made all that money?” a teacher asked him.) So he “reconnected” with kids from his old school, Allen-Stevenson. One of them introduced him to Patrick, an aspiring financier, who introduced him to Damir at a poker game attended by kids whose parents are, according to Damir, “the one percent of the one percent.”The son of a Kazakh oligarch, Damir is tall, slim, and cocky, like a cigarette wearing a fedora. “I call the poker game ‘Destiny,'""he said. The waitress arrived with a plate. “Here, have some caviar.”Over late nights out and dinners at Morimoto, the three hatched a plan to start a hedge fund. “There are a lot of steps we have to follow through,” said Patrick, calling to mind a more serious Chuck Bass. “But we’re on the right track.” They plan to launch in June, after Mo turns 18 and can get his broker-dealer license. “Mo’s our maestro,” Patrick said. “He’s going to be earning the big bucks. We’re just going to try to fill his needs.”All three plan to attend college next year, but they’re not concerned about classes getting in the way of their goal: “A billion dollars!” Damir said. “By next year!” Mo affirmed the number with a nod. “But it’s not just about money,” he added. “We want to create a brotherhood. Like, all of us who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence, like the Koch brothers …”“Like in Wolf of Wall Street!” Damir interjected. “And Mo is Jordan Belfort.”“No, but, not like that,” Patrick said, blanching slightly.Like Belfort, Mo started with penny stocks. A cousin showed him how to trade. He loved the feeling of risk—the way his hand shook making the trade—but he swore it off after losing a chunk of the money he’d made tutoring. “I didn’t have the balls for it,” he said. He was 9.It was a while before he was ready to try again. In the meantime, he became a scholar of modern finance, studying up on hedge-fund managers. He was particularly enamored of Paul Tudor Jones. “I had been paralyzed by my loss,” Mo said. “But he was able to go back to it, even after losing thousands of dollars over and over. Paul Tudor Jones says, ‘You learn more from your losses than from your gains.’ ” Mo got into trading oil and gold, and his bank account grew. Though he is shy about the $72 million number, he confirmed his net worth is in the “high eight figures.” More than enough to rent an apartment in Manhattan—though his parents won’t let him live in it until he turns 18—and acquire a BMW, which he can’t drive because he doesn’t yet have a license. Thus, it falls to his father to drive him past Tudor Jones’s Greenwich house for inspiration. “It’s because he is who he is that made me who I am today,” Mo said.Which is to say: a believer in Wall Street. “A lot of young people do start-ups, but I think it’s a bubble. Trading and investments will always be there. Money will always be rotating—”“Money never sleeps!” Damir added. “That’s from the Wall Street movie.”“It all comes down to this,” Mo continued. “What makes the world go round? Money. If money is not flowing, if businesses don’t keep going, there’s no innovation, no products, no investments, no growth, no jobs.”The check arrived for the caviar and apple juice. It totaled $400.“New York, that’s where the money’s at,” Damir shouted, pulling out a credit card.This reminded me of an old joke about robbing banks because that’s where the money is. Damir grinned. “My father has a quote,” he said. “It’s really dope: ‘You can rob a bank with a gun, but you can rob the whole world with a bank.’ ”Patrick buried his face in his hands. “At the end of the day,” he said, “we’re young kids.”"	1.0
http://www.emergent.info/texas-turkey-farm-ebola-hoax	Claim: A Texas turkey farm was contaminated with Ebola	false	['Ebola', 'Fake News', 'Texas']	dailybuzzlive.com	http://dailybuzzlive.com/texas-turkey-farm-contaminated-ebola-holiday-turkeys-infected/	2014/11/16	Texas Turkey Farm Contaminated With Ebola, Over 250,000 Holiday Turkeys InfectedPosted onby Daily Buzz LiveTexas Turkey Farm Contaminated With Ebola, Over 250,000 Holiday Turkeys Infected.A Texas turkey farm employee is now under quarantine after he tested positive for the Ebola virus. Texas Prime Turkey Farm, the largest supplier of turkeys in the United States, has been ordered by the CDC to quarantine over 250,000 holiday turkeys. The CDC has confirmed 3,000 turkeys have tested positive for the virus since Friday’s incident.According to investigators, long time employee Philip Canseco was seen vomiting in the facilities restroom three days prior to the incident on Friday. “I was passing by the restroom, when I heard somebody throwing up inside,” said one Texas Prime Turkey Farm employee. “I opened the door and looked inside and saw Canseco throwing up in one of the urinals. I asked him if he was okay, he said yes, and I left. I didn’t want to get close to him and get sick.”Management confirmed that Canseco worked three full work days at the facility with flu-like symptoms, before passing out unconscious with a fever of 106°. Due to his symptoms, he was rushed to a local hazmat tent where he tested positive for the Ebola virus. The CDC reports an additional 7 coworkers are being quarantined and tested. However, they have not released those results as of yet.The facility has been ordered by the CDC to burn their entire flock of turkeys, over 250,000. Texas Prime Turkey Farm is requesting permission from the state of Texas to send the shipment of incinerated turkey ashes to Veolia’s Port Arthur environmental waste facility. This facility has already accepted one shipment of Ebola waste from household goods where Thomas Eric Duncan had stayed. Duncan was the first man to die of  Ebola on US soil.Activists are protesting the shipments of contaminated Ebola waste to their community. “We feel every precaution should be taken to protect our community, our children and our elderly. We are not a dumping ground for the nations, or the world’s bio waste.”Plant manager Mitch Osborne said on Saturday that even though no contract has yet been signed, the plant will likely receive the second shipment of contaminated Ebola waste. “It is a safe and sound process,” Osborne said. “I am not going to place my employees in harms way, or the community. The company is here to improve the environment and I believe we are doing a pretty darn good job of that. I believe we are doing the right and safe thing.”A spokesperson for Texas Prime Turkey Farm said there is a good chance Ebola turkeys may have already shipped out to major suppliers for distribution. Each retailer will have to perform recalls individually if they feel they have received a contaminated shipment.	1.0

The movie will take place from the day Jax was born, and leads up to the era just before Sons Of Anarchy began as a series.”Sutter also said that he is really happy to bring Ryan Hurst back as Opie Winston, and hopes fans will forgive him for killing Opie off. “Man I tell ya, when we killed Opie off, it was like the thing turned real. I’ve never gone public with this, but I’ve had people get really crazy when they see me in public,” said Sutter. “They shout at me, and they get angry – ‘You shouldn’t have killed Ope! I hope you rot in Hell!,’ that sort of thing. I had people try to run me off the road when they recognized me, although that just might be because I’m kind of a dangerous driver. Anyway, my hope is that this film will help them cope.”Sutter says pre-production on film will begin in the middle of 2015, and will begin shooting sometime in the fall. “For a movie of this scope, with this much storyline attached, you should expect to see the film by the end of 2016,” said Sutter. “In the mean time, buy all the official Sons of Anarchy merchandise you can. Every dollar goes to helping get this movie completed. Brad Pitt isn’t cheap, you know.” 	1.0
http://www.emergent.info/Apple-Edition-cost-10k	Claim: The larger Apple Watch Edition will cost $10,000	true	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Edition', 'Apple Watch Price', 'Grail Watch', 'Stephen Foskett']	grail-watch.com	http://grail-watch.com/2015/02/16/gold-apple-watch-edition-must-cost-10000/	2015/02/27	b'The Apple Watch is a fairly large chunk of gold!Get ready for the tech press to flip out when Apple announces the retail price for the gold Apple Watch Edition model. Apple critics have always roasted the company for selling products that are more expensive than they should be, and they frequently use this as a wedge topic to criticize buyers. But the 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition will set a whole new bar with a sales price of $10,000. The funny thing in this case is that Apple is perfectly right to be charging that much!Do you disagree? Check out my counterpoint, The Case Against the $10,000 Gold Apple Watch EditionGold is ExpensiveLets start with a little backgrounder in gold. Everyone has a vague sense that gold is expensive. Even rabid Internet trolls have seen the banner ads and heard about that in the news. But most people dont understand just how expensive even a little bit of gold is. So this is a good place to begin the discussion.Update: My calculations were wrong! Also, this was a bit back of the envelope. Now that it has some readership I realize I should go back and fix the calculations in the article to be more realistic...Here are the basic facts:Gold currently sells for between $1,200 and $1,300 per troy ounce and has been over $1,000 per troy ounce for the last five years.18-karat gold contains 75% pure gold, and that term is regulated by law.One ounce of 18k gold occupies about 1.8 cubic centimeters of volume since a typical 18-karat gold alloy weighs about 16.5 grams per cc.18-karat gold currently sells for $29.11 per gram, $905 per troy ounce, or $480 per cc..25 cc of 18k gold is about enough to construct a watch buckle and .75 cc gets you a deployant clasp. It takes a few more to build a watch case, anywhere from 1.5 to 8 cc depending on the size and thickness of the case. So the buckle is worth $120-$360 and the watch case $720 to $3800 just as raw gold. This is why gold watches generally sell for a lot more than $6,000!Gold Watches are ExpensiveLets apply this to a watch case. Imagine you wanted to create a rectangular case 42 mm high by 36 mm wide by 10 mm deep. If it was solid, this would equal 15.12 cc of volume. But its a watch case, so you have to leave room for the movement, dial, case back, etc. So lets just leave 5 mm of thickness all around, making a hollow rectangle. This equals 6.8 cc (42 x 36 x 10  32 x 26 x 10). Therefore, the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost $3,200 as of this writing.A simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18-karat gold would cost more than $3,200Now lets consider the same shape but just 2 mm thick. Thats 2.9 cc of gold, worth $1,400. Pick your thickness and youre still looking at thousands of dollars worth of gold.How does this translate in the real world? Lets look at the retail price of some watches that are available in both stainless steel and 18-karat gold.This Cartier Tank MC is $15,000 more in 18k goldThe Cartier Tank MC measures 44 mm by 34 mm by 9.5 mm thick: $15,000 extra (list) for 18k goldCartier Tank MC in stainless steel: $7,000 list, $5,800 streetCartier Tank MC in 18k pink gold: $22,000 list, $18,200 streetThe Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime measures 50.5 mm by 34.9 mm by 14 mm thick: $14,750 extra (list) for 18k goldJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in stainless steel: $8,550 list, $6,800 streetJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in 18k pink gold: $23,300 list, $18,400 streetThis list could go on and on, but the gist is simple: 18-karat gold cases cost a lot more than stainless steel. In fact, its pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under $10,000 in any size and from any manufacturer. Even tiny quartz ladies watches like the tiny Chopard Happy Sport Mini sells for $11,000! Most of the bargains commenters have pointed to are either 14-karat or less, very slim and small, or long out of production and with outdated pricing.Then theres the bracelet. Swap a gold bracelet for a leather strap and you are looking at an extra $20,000. Adding a gold bracelet to that Jaeger-LeCoultre bumps the price to $42,900!Certainly there is quite a bit of profit in luxury watches, but one simply cannot deny the raw material value in a gold watch case. And the gold market is liquid like stocks and other commodities: There are plenty of buyers and sellers of gold, and plenty of reserves, so no company, no matter how strong, can expect favorable pricing from their suppliers.Another reason companies charge so much for gold watches and jewelry is as a hedge against volatility. They cant price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long. So they generally price somewhat higher than they would, even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials, labor, distribution, and profit in a watch.The Apple Watch Edition Will Cost $10,000Theres a reason I picked those two watches for my comparisons: Both are similar in size and shape to the 42 mm Apple Watch. The Cartier is a little smaller and the Jaeger-LeCoultre is a little larger, but both represent a traditional watchmakers gold-cased square-ish offering in the space. And both cost more than $20,000, with much of that price going to the gold case and matching buckle. And Jony Ive recently said that the historic Cartier Tank was one of his inspirations for the Apple Watch design!Apple would be crazy to sell the Apple Watch Edition for $20,000, though. Thats not going to happen. So theyre likely to find ways to reduce the cost dramatically.First, as we can see, the Apple Watch case is highly rounded in all three dimensions. Although questionable from an esthetic standpoint, this reduces the amount of material required by quite a lot. Second, Apple Watch has a large sapphire crystal front and back with the display, sensors, and such. Third, the interior frame is likely made of steel or aluminum, not gold, to reduce cost and increase commonality with the aluminum and steel versions.Could it be gold plated? No. Numerous reports state that it is a solid gold case. Although Apple has not apparently used the word, solid in their press releases, they do claim it is crafted from 18-karat gold and nowhere does it say it is plated or gold filled (the industry term). There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple cannot break these any more than Tiffany could.Apple says that the Apple Watch will start at $349 for that aluminum Sport model, and many bloggers have reported the price for the steel Apple Watch to be roughly $1,000. It is reasonable to assume that the gold Edition model will sell for substantially more than this, with many suggesting $4,000 or $5,000. But remember that this price would only cover 4 or 5 ounces of gold! Even with thin walls and a steel frame, its hard to see how Apple could make a solid 18-karat gold case and buckle for a 42 mm watch with just 3 ounces of gold.Gold is soft, but Apple claims that their special gold is twice as hard as standard gold. Taking that at face value, perhaps they reduced the thickness of the case commensurately, cutting the amount of gold in half versus a standard rectangular watch. This still leaves a few thousand dollars of material value in the case. The Apple Watch Edition will come in 38 mm and 42 mm sizes, a difference of about 20% in terms of case volume. So the smaller model could sell for 20% less still.My prediction is that the 42 mm Apple Watch Edition will retail for $9,999 with the 38 mm Apple Watch Edition retailing for $7,999. This covers the cost of the gold case, the internals, manufacturing, sales, and profit, and yet does not leave Apple subsidizing the world gold market by selling at a discount or cheating with a too-thin or plated case. I will be shocked if the price is $4,999, but I suppose its possible with some finagling and if thats the smaller model. And it will not be any less than that.This is a $10,000 productBonus prediction: Given the very high price of the Apple Watch Edition, I predict that availability will be quite limited. Apple will likely create special store-within-a-store spaces in certain Apple Store locations for the Edition. I further expect them to open special standalone Apple Edition Boutiques to sell the Watch Edition, accessories, and perhaps other future high-end products.Update!Needless to say, many people disagree with me. And now that @Gruber Fireballed this post, I imagine Ill hear from lots of them real soon!The gist of the disagreement lies in the amount of gold needed for the watch case. I assumed it would be quite thick (read sturdy) and would contain upwards of 130 grams of 18k gold. Then theres the strap lugs and buckle which would likely contain another few dozen grams. But @GAK_PDX  (and others, though he was most visually eloquent) suspects it contains much less gold.For fun, I took my Apple Watch models and used SW and some basic assumptions to figure the gold content. 29.16g: pic.twitter.com/WGEnjtj1Yh Greg Koenig (@gak_pdx) February 19, 2015I think this number is way too low, but its a good lower bound if the case was very thin and completely hollow. And it puts the raw gold at about $849 at $29.11 per gram of 18k gold. Although this is admittedly much, much lower than my estimate, it still illustrates my point that the Apple Watch Edition is not going to be cheap. And I think hes way off but time will tell who is right and who is wrong.Another argument is based on this 2006 analysis of a gold Rolex watch. Right off the bat one should point out that gold cost $400/oz when it was written and that watch includes a gold bracelet as well, something Apple is apparently not going to do with the Edition. That Rolex case contained 18.5 grams of gold alloy, but its much, much smaller than the Apple watch and its circular to boot! A 34mm circle is 107mm in circumference, while the 42mm Apple Watch is 156mm in circumference. Use the magic of math to scale the Rolex up into a 42mm rectangle and were at 27.75 grams. But that case is also much thinner since we excluded the bezel, and the Apple Watch is pretty slab-sided. So we can probably double this safely and come out with $1,615 of gold in my mangled square Rolex case.So there are lower estimates than mine for the amount and value of the gold. I can accept that. But lets take a step back and think about the final price. Even if it contained less than $1,500 of gold, how much would it sell for? Certainly not $2,000 or $3,000. You still have to account for the cost of everything else, plus the intangibles of manufacturing and distribution. And profit for Apple (and a hedge against the volatility of the price of gold). So were back at the $4,000-$5,000 estimate others have made. As Greg Koenig tweeted, and Forbes reported, If anyone thinks Apple is charging less than $5k for the Edition, they are smoking crack.Regardless of the total, its important to realize that the price of gold is in the drivers seat when it comes to pricing the Apple Watch Edition.Id love to be wrong, and I look forward to updating this piece.

http://www.emergent.info/Apple-Watch-Edition-price	Claim: The gold Apple Watch Edition will start at $4,999 USD	false	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Price', 'Gene Munster', 'Piper Jaffray']	appleinsider.com	http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/03/02/piper-jaffray-pegs-stainless-steel-apple-watch-price-at-499-edition-at-4999	2015/03/03	"By Mikey CampbellMonday, March 02, 2015, 06:55 pm PT (09:55 pm ET)Investment firm Piper Jaffray issued a report on Monday breaking down expected Apple Watch average selling prices, saying an aggregate of consumers will likely spend closer to $550 on the device, considering case and internal storage options.Building off Apple's quoted starting price of $349 , analyst Gene Munster anticipates combined Apple Watch ASPs to fall closer to $550, or $575 to $600 including additional bands.Apple Watch will come in three separate price tiers —Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition —each series including two display sizes and a variety of strap choices.Starting with Apple Watch Sport, the aluminum and glass version widely thought to be the least expensive model, Munster expects an ASP of $450 after factoring in configuration alternatives like case and internal storage options.The stainless steel Apple Watch model, which also features a more expensive sapphire glass cover, is expected to start at $499 to $549, again depending on customizable features. Munster sees an overall ASP at around $650 for the mid-tier Watch series.On the high end, the analyst forecasts base model Apple Watch Edition devices to start at $4,999, but classifies segment ASP closer to $7,500 after adding in straps made from precious metals.Based on current pricing for Apple's silicon iPhone 6 cases, which come in at $35, Munster sees elastomer Apple Watch straps to start in a similar $29 to $35 range, while leather bands could be priced between $49 to $59. Pricing for metal bands like the link bracelet and Milanese loop are more difficult to determine, but the analyst believes steel versions will come in at $99, while gold bands could be priced into the thousands of dollars.""If you assume that 55 percent of bands purchased are elastomer, 35 percent leather, 10 percent steel, and about 5,000 total gold bands are sold, the average band ASP could be around $50,"" Munster writes.He added that if half of all Watch buyers purchase a band —assuming 8 million Watches are sold in 2015 —the accessory range would add $25 to Apple's watch category, equating to a $575 ASP. If every Watch customer purchases an extra strap, it would tack on $50, bringing ASP up to $600.The lower-cost Sport model is expected to make up 55 percent of overall Watch sales, while the mid-tier Apple Watch will take another 45 percent. That leaves very little room for Apple Watch Edition, but Munster believes Apple might sell roughly 10,000 units this year. In an interesting comparison, the firm calculates that Apple Watch Edition business could equate to about two percent of luxury watchmaker Rolex, which moves between 600,000 to 750,000 units each year.Finally, Munster expects Apple to reveal a better sense of device pricing at its March 9 event , as well as highlight ""special features"" to drum up consumer interest ahead of release.AppleInsider will be covering the ""Spring forward"" event live from San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center next week.Topics:"	1.0

He was 81 years old. Rumors of Nelson’s death first circulated early July 21, 2015 on social media outlets but was later confirmed by police.A groundskeeper scheduled to perform yard maintenance on Nelson’s property reportedly found the singer/songwriter unresponsive on the front lawn and immediately called 911.“There was no evidence of drug abuse or alcohol and no signs of foul play,” said Det. Aldeson.“Determining an official cause of death could take as long as 3 weeks,” said County Coroner Frank Shultz. “It’s just too early to tell what caused his tragic death.”The shocking news comes just days after a recent “60 Minutes” interview where Nelson was quoted as saying “Life is good and I have never felt better or been happier.”This story is still developing and all information is not yet officially verified.Related Posts	1.0

She also used the meat of the cats to lure other cats who unwittingly were eating their own species, a disgusting and cruel hobby admits local PETA spokeswoman Jane Churchill.I cant believe these atrocities happened in our own backyard. Animals are our brothers and sisters and what she has done to my eyes is comparable to mass murder she explains. She has taken the lives of hundreds of cats just to make fur coats out of them, this is tragic. How would people react if someone made coats out of human skin? These cats are living beings and all living beings are equal to Mother Earth. I hope she goes to jail for a very long time Legal experts assess the 85-year old woman could spend up to 18 months in jail for her crimes. Share763K Tweet '	1.0

http://www.emergent.info/feminist-blogger-abortion	Claim: A woman aborted a fetus after discovering it was male	unverified	['Abortion', 'Blogging', 'Feminism', 'Hoaxes']	injusticestories.com	http://injusticestories.com/i-aborted-my-baby-because-it-was-a-boy/	2015/02/11	I Aborted My Baby – Because it was a Boy13145Facebook TwitterShareOver the past 3 years, I have lost many friends, and several of my own family members have completely cut off communication with me. I now know that these are “adults” who just cannot handle the fact that I have the right to make choices, and that these choices ultimately hardly even affect them.1/17/15 – Editor’s note: Due to the large number of interview requests, I have extended an invitation to the author to post her response to the comments and general negative feelings towards her. I will post an update as soon as she responds.In the spring of 2012, I found out that I was pregnant. I had a good idea who the donator was, but money wasn’t really an issue, and I knew that I would be a good mother-like figure for the child by myself. I have always believed in the right for all women to have a choice in terminating their pregnancy, but when I confirmed the diagnosis about a month into into it, I decided that I WAS ready to have this child.My journey has taken me to many different places fighting for women’s rights and carrying the banner of the Feminist Movement, even to the point of eschewing a career. One of the more prominent themes that I saw in these places was that men generally would look down on us, refuse to help us, or hardly even lend an ear so that we could air our grievances. This didn’t surprise me, the patriarchy has been well entrenched since the dawn of time, but here I was, here I am, ready to change it.One of the more alarming incidents happened while I was on my way to San Francisco to participate in an Occupy Wall Street rally. I sat down in my seat on the plane, which happened to be extra full for that day, and a particularly well dressed man happened to be sitting in the seat beside me, in the aisle. After takeoff, he asked me what I was going to San Francisco for, while I generally wouldn’t talk to a man sitting next to me on an airplane, I told him I was going to the OWS rally.The man literally scoffed when I spoke those words and leaned in and quietly said to me “B****** like you need to learn their place”. Stunned, I screamed “ASSAULT!” while other passengers looked at us, the woman across the aisle from him immediately told him to get away from me, but not 5 seconds passed before a flight attendant had rushed over to intervene. [sociallocker id=”86″] As I explained to the flight attendant what had happened and I demanded to move seats, I was told that there were only 2 other open seats available, both back in Economy.*Trigger warning* – Extreme patriarchyBy this time, a male flight attendant was on the scene and I told him to have the man moved. The woman-hater just laughed as the flight attendant continued to press me on if he made any physical contact with me. For a moment, I contemplated bending the truth in order to get the woman-hater away from me. His words had violated both my feelings, and my trust, perhaps as much of a violation as actual physical touch. In the end, I confirmed that no physical contact was made, to which both flight attendants told me they couldn’t make him move.I was flabbergasted, and then betrayed as they recommended that I move to one of the empty seats. This left me in tears. I knew the only way to get away was to move seats so I did so tearfully and having felt as though I had been verbally and emotionally raped.By the time we landed, my outlook had changed, I could no longer depend on men to be an ally of the cause.As spring turned into summer and my belly started to grow, my mind ran wild with the thoughts of teaching my daughter from a young age tolerance and feminist ideals. Choosing the right all-girls daycare, then elementary school, all so that she could grow up and thrive in an environment where women are told that they can do anything that they want to do. No man will be around to hurt her progress, no boys there to demean her or call her names.I had already started buying gender neutral clothing since I did not want outside influences affecting what gender she would ultimately become. My research on nannies one day came to an abrupt end when my cell phone alarm went off – time for my 5 month appointment. These early appointments had gone well enough, my baby was progressing in a healthy manner.Today, my doctor, who I will call “Sandy” did an ultrasound and everything appeared to be fine. “Would you like to know the gender?” Sandy asked. I thought to myself “That machine is an ultrasound, not a crystal ball, you couldn’t tell me the gender of my baby even if you wanted to”“Sure” was my response.“It’s a boy”…..……“What?” I managed to sputter. Sandy then showed me on the ultrasound how exactly my body had betrayed me even worse than the misogynistic suit jockey on the airplane so many months before. I was in shock, I started crying, weeping at the thought of what I was about to curse the world with.On my way home, my driver asked if I was ok and if I needed anything. “JUST STOP RIGHT HERE” I yelled. Deciding to walk the 4 blocks back home. My home became my prison and my fetus became my warden the next 48 hours. Crying, sobbing, uncontrollable weeping, mental anguish the likes of which may only be experienced by those who have had their lives destroyed by war, I was a refugee, and my home was my refugee camp, an unfamiliar place that was just….sheltering me.By the third day, I started regaining some of my mental strength and knew what I had to do. I couldn’t bring another monster into the world. We already have enough enemies as it is. It didn’t matter that I would be raising a son, he would still come into contact with boys, men, perhaps even the suit jockey who would inevitably twist his carefully constructed upbringing with their kindness. He would think “These men aren’t so bad, why would mom say that they are holding me down?”Not all men are bad, my driver showed genuine concern for my well-being that day and I may have taken my anger out on him. That may have been uncalled for. But I knew what I had to do.A few days later, I went in for the procedure, as it was fairly later in my pregnancy, I was aware there were certain risks, but it went off without a hitch. My body’s betrayal was no more, I was free, and for the first time since the airplane incident, I felt strong. I had done something positive, something that would actually make a difference, something good, even though as I would find out, many others wouldn’t see it that way.Today, I have a beautiful 1 year old female who will hopefully grow up to be just as strong and driven as her mother. I have endured a lot regarding my first pregnancy, but I don’t care. Sometimes, even allies will turn on you, but I don’t care.I stand by my decision to abort my baby because it was a male.I don’t hate men, I hate the patriarchy, what men, and even some women, turn into, I wasn’t going to let that happen with my offspring. The chances were greater that it would with a male, it was unacceptable.If the curse returns, I would do the exact same thing all over again.[/sociallocker]30 thoughts on “I Aborted My Baby – Because it was a Boy”My internet name says:TL:DR womans meets an asshole on a plane, who happens to be a man, falsely claims assault and 5 MONTHS aborts a boy because it’s a boy EVEN THOUGH she made a point of raising her girl gender neutral.Dave Spiller says:Doesn’t all-girl daycare and schooling just reinforce the gender divide, telling boys and girls they are defined by their sex?Totally says:No no no, this is gender equality did you even read the tags. It’s all good, all good.Sammy says:January 17, 2015 at 10:11 amThis is not meant to be hateful or condescending so please please read this.  I feel like you’re taking the wrong mentality with this.  Part of how we change society is by teaching our children.  If your child is a boy, you can help change society by teaching him that misogyny is wrong and to treat women with respect and equality.  He would then, in turn pass that on to his children, and so on, and so forth.  I’m not saying a girl doesn’t also have the power to change things for the better but when the issue lies with the way men think, you had a chance to bring a respectful male into the world who would then be helping to pass on that mentality.  I support a woman’s right to an abortion because there are several reasons why it might be necessary.  Be it an inability to care for the child, the woman’s life being in danger, or an unwanted pregnancy due to rape, just to name a few.  However I feel the gender of your child is not a valid reason as it’s extremely superficial and even somewhat hypocritical, especially when gender is a social construct anyway.  Nothing can be changed and what you’ve done cannot be taken back so I won’t dwell on it and berate you for it but I do sincerely hope that if you ever have any more children, please give them all an equal chance, regardless of gender.  If the child is a boy, use it as an opportunity to teach them what’s right so they can pass it down.  If the child is a girl, then teach them to be strong like you currently are with your daughter.  The gender of your child should never matter and by being selective, all you’re doing is supporting inequality in either gender.Disa says:January 27, 2015 at 10:33 amAGREED! Doesn’t matter the gender of your child, it is your child so you get to teach them what you think is right and they will pick that up and teach it to more people, male or female. Boy children are not born with any hatred for women. They are born with compassion and love for their mother and or other caretaker. Their mother, father, or other caretakers are who teach the child who to hate, not their assigned gender.Ashish says:’’Teach them to be strong like you currently are’’….Sabrina Parnas says:January 17, 2015 at 12:42 pmYou are a sick and twisted individual. A man hater like no other. Having a young child that is male, it makes me think that you could just abort it because it was a boy. You don’t deserve to have children if you discriminate based on their sex. You are no worse than all the men who are misogynist.Although I am very much pro choice, I find your reasoning flawed and disturbing. I hope you won’t damage your child with your vitriol.And where is the gender equality, if you are ready to abort at the first sign that it is a boy.Michael G says:January 17, 2015 at 2:39 pmYour loss.

If abortion is truly a woman’s choice, then what business is it of ours to question the reasons behind her choice?  As I see it, there are only two possibilities*:A fetus is a meaningless bundle of tissue, without whatever makes life worthy of protection.or:A fetus is a human being.If the first is true, then what difference does it make why she had the abortion?  It was a lifeless ball of inanimate matter.  It was no more legally or morally wrong than choosing to play checkers, or choosing not to.  And if the second is true, again, why should it matter?  Aborting for ANY reason would be murder.  (health reasons may leave no alternative, but the result is still a purposefully dead child)  In either case, the reasoning behind the decision to abort is irrelevant.  The only question is whether the concept of abortion (for non-health reasons) is morally defensible.*Of course, it’s entirely possible that a fetus is both, starting as lifeless, then becoming human at some point.  In that case, no one knows when that transition occurs, leaving us again with only the above two choices.Joe Wilson says:That was disturbing and sad.scott not scared to use my real name mother fucking rodger says:I dont even have words.Ravi says:Um…not clear on how a fetus can be called a ‘boy.’ It could easily have been a trans girl, gay boy or non-binary person.

My husband is an amazing caring smart guy whom i hope my son takes after and we’ll do our best to help him grown into a wonder man.All I see from this is hatred of men instead of thinking you could have helped bring a wonderful man into the world you chose to KILL him. . It’s heartbreaking.I’m not against abortion for the RIGHT reasons.. Medical or rape but because it’s the wrong gender??????.Feminist you are not! And I as one am ashamed of youwhy says:Love how you delete hateful comments so much for freedom of speech.Bombe 20 says:January 29, 2015 at 4:20 pmLet me start by saying this: I totally respect and support the right of every woman to decide whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term. For any reason at all. A pregnancy has all sorts of effects on the body (and the mind) and while I find the slogan “my body, my choice” a bit too slogan-ish, I consider it basically correct.Now, I do think it is too late for an abortion once the fetus could be kept alive outside the womb, but that is a different discussion.But I have just had a look into my crystal ball and learned a few interesting about your daughter:In one to two years, she will find out that she has a sex — that she is a girl. And she will strongly defend that. She will love Arielle and Barbie and all things pink. She will want to be a princess for Halloween.Maybe you will try to push her in a different direction. You will give her a toy car. She will cuddle it, give it a name and put it to bed. Then you will give her a toy plane. She will make sure the plane becomes friends with the car and put them to bed together. You will give her toy tools. She will use the hammer as a baby bottle to feed the plane and the car. And she’ll still like pink.Sure, you will try to reason with her, argue with her, maybe shout at her. But that won’t change anything. At the most, she will learn not to talk about what she likes because it upsets mommy; in that case, you will not have liberated her, you will have broken her.Eventually she will learn what you did. That you betrayed her out of having an elder brother. An elder brother who would have loved her, cherished her, protected her. Maybe you will be able to outwardly convince her that your decision and your reasons were right. But deep inside she will despise you.And somewhere around 13 to 16 years of age she will start to rebel.

Under attack: An Iraqi army soldier aims his weapon during clashes with ISIS militants in Jurf al-Sakhar - 43 miles south of Baghdad - at the weekend. ISIS militants reportedly killed 1,000 such soldiers yesterday   Defence: Fierce fighting has been reported on the outskirts of Baghdad where ISIS militants are attempting to seize control of the Iraqi capital.

Earlier Canon White had claimed the terrorist group were six miles from the city   No protection: Canon Andrew White later updated his Facebook page questioning the ability of the Iraqi Army  FEMALE PILOT LEADS FIRST SORTIE A female fighter pilot led Britain's first combat mission against Islamic State.The woman, who has not been named, flew one of the RAF Tornados on the perilous sortie over jihadist-held territory in northern Iraq on Saturday.Stationed at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, she is believed to be a weapons systems operator.She sits in the jet's rear seat and fires the aircraft's Brimstone and Storm Shadow missiles and Paveway IV bombs.The airwoman, who serves with II (AC) Squadron, flies at exactly the same combat level as her male colleagues.A Ministry of Defence source said: 'No one makes a big fuss of having a female pilot. We have females in aircrews and ground crews and they are here because of their abilities. Everyone is just doing their jobs.'The news comes as RAF jets flew armed sorties for a second day over Iraq yesterday  but despite having now sent out jets five times, they again failed to locate any suitable targets for their weapons.Defence chiefs insisted that the flights by Tornado GR4 fighter-bombers were invaluable for gathering intelligence on the Islamist jihadists who have swept across large swathes of Iraq and Syria, carrying out massacres.But the failure to unleash any firepower has fuelled concern that Britain is failing to pull its weight in the international coalition against Islamic StateIt came as military commanders warned that Britain should brace itself to be dragged into a ground war in Iraq to crush IS, which is also known as Isis and Isil. Former top brass also warned that the air campaign would be futile unless the UK could target the terrorists in Syria.While the Ministry of Defence confirmed that the RAF's third mission had  like on Saturday  failed to locate any targets, US-led coalition aircraft targeted four makeshift oil refineries under IS control in Syria, as well as a command centre.The mobile refineries generate up to 1.2million a day for the militants.   On a mission: The RAF jets seek out their terror targets in Iraq - which they failed to find and bomb, again   Strong presence: Military leaders have said about two-thirds of the estimated 31,000 Islamic State militants were in Syria. But ISIS have held a number of towns and villages close to the Iraqi capital since earlier in the year, when government troops melted away following a lightning advance in the west of the countryMeanwhile, U.S. President Barack Obama has acknowledged that US intelligence agencies underestimated the threat posed by ISIS extremists in Syria, and overestimated the capabilities of the Iraqi army.Obama added that breaking up the terrorist cell will be a complicated battle involving both military and political action. The president spoke about the multi-national effort against ISIS in a televised interview with 60 Minutes, which aired Sunday night.Citing earlier comments by James Clapper, director of national intelligence, Mr Obama acknowledged that U.S. intelligence didn't take seriously enough what had been taking place in Syria.'Well I think, our head of the intelligence community, Jim Clapper, has acknowledged that I think they underestimated what had been taking place in Syria,' Mr Obama said.Conversely, the United States overestimated the ability of the Iraqi army to fight the militant groups, Obama said in the interview taped on Friday, days after the president made his case at the United Nations for action.   President Obama says the US intelligence agencies underestimated Islamic State activity in Syria and overestimated the Iraqi army's role to fight back against militants    Speaking to CBS's 60 Minutes, he said the militants had used the chaos of the Syrian civil war, when large swathes of the country were ungoverned, to 'reconstitute themselves'   Militants: The terrorist-group ISIS has been taking large swaths of Syria and Iraq in the recent absence of a permanent U.S. military presence in Iraq  KEY PARTNERS IN THE COALITION AGAINST THE ISLAMIC STATE  The U.S.-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group is growing, with dozens of countries among its ranks. The coalition is contributing a wide range of efforts, from carrying out airstrikes to providing military assistance and humanitarian aid.Here are some of the key partners in the coalition.UNITED STATESThe U.S., which is leading the coalition, has launched dozens of airstrikes on Islamic State targets. It also has sent military advisers, supplies and humanitarian aid to help Iraqi troops and Kurdish forces beat back the insurgents.GULF STATESSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have participated in airstrikes in Syria. A fourth, Qatar, has played what the Pentagon called a supporting role.The Emirates and Qatar also host air bases that are being used for the coalition's aerial campaign against the Islamic State group. U.S. Navy ships involved in the airstrikes are assigned to the Bahrain-based Fifth Fleet. Saudi Arabia has agreed to host training facilities for Syrian rebels on its territory.JORDANJordan has launched airstrikes against Islamic State positions, with government spokesman Mohammad al-Momani calling the move 'necessary in light of continuous attempts to infiltrate our borders.' The kingdom didn't give any specifics about its operations, but said the airstrikes aim to insure the country's security.EGYPTEgypt hasn't announced any specific participation in airstrikes, but President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi told the AP that Egypt is 'completely committed to giving support,' and will do 'whatever is required' to support the coalition.ISRAELIsrael is offering intelligence estimates and concrete intelligence to the U.S. on the Islamic State group as part of ongoing intelligence sharing between the two countries, an Israeli defense official said. But, he added, Israel wasn't asked to contribute anything beyond that. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly on the issue. The prime minister's office declined to comment.BRITAINBritain said that Tornado fighter bombers, supported by air-to-air refueling aircraft and signals intelligence, are operating over Iraq. Britain's media has widely reported that six warplanes are on standby in Cyprus, but defense officials have declined to offer specific numbers. Ben Goodlad from IHS Jane's has said that the Tornado jets offer the coalition enhanced capability to engage moving targets. Britain also has two weapons for long-range strikes: the Tornado's Storm Shadow cruise missile and the submarine-launched Tomahawk cruise missile, he said.FRANCEFrance has carried out airstrikes in Iraq on two occasions since joining the U.S.-led coalition on Sept. 19, firing laser-guided bombs from Rafale fighter planes upon munitions and military hardware stockpiles  first near northern Mosul, then on Thursday, near Fallujah. France is conducting the operations in Iraq from a French air base in the United Arab Emirates. The base, with about 750 French service personnel and six Rafales, is 1,700 kilometers (1,050 miles) from Mosul, meaning that the planes need refueling in flight to strike in Iraq.AUSTRALIAAn Australian air force contingent, including eight F/A-18 Hornet jet fighters and two support aircraft, has arrived in the United Arab Emirates. About 600 troops  most of them air force personnel  are being deployed with the aircraft. The jets are expected to be used in airstrikes against Islamic State fighters in Iraq, although the Australian government has yet to commit to a combat role.BELGIUMSix F-16 multirole fighters and a contingent of 120 support staff, including eight pilots, to be based in Jordan. Authorized to take part in operations over Iraq for one month, subject to extension if approved by the Belgian government.DENMARKDenmark has pledged seven F-16 fighter jets  four operational planes and three reserve jets along with pilots and support staff for 12 months. The U.S. also has asked Danes to provide military trainers to Iraq to school Iraqi and Kurdish fighters battling the Islamic State group on the ground. Denmark has already contributed a transport plane with personnel to a U.S.-led humanitarian operation in northern Iraq.CANADACanada has contributed about 70 special operations soldiers to offer instruction to Kurdish forces battling Islamic State militants in northern Iraq. Early this week, Prime Minister Stephen Harper's Cabinet will be considering a U.S. request to support airstrikes against Islamic State forces. This could include five to eight CF-18 fighter aircraft as well as tanker aircraft. Canada has already contributed two military cargo planes that carried weapons to Kurdish fighters.GERMANYGermany isn't participating in any airstrikes against the Islamic State group. They have sent weapons to Kurdish fighters in Irbil, and a group of Kurdish peshmerga fighters arrived in Germany to receive weapons' training here by the German army. There's also German military in Irbil to train the peshmerga fighters in Irbil.GREECEGreece is participating with humanitarian aid and by sending ammunition for Kurdish forces fighting the Islamic State group. They haven't specified any more details on quantities or type of humanitarian aid.GEORGIAGeorgia will be providing humanitarian assistance, not military aid, according to comments made by Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili on Thursday to local news websites.HUNGARYHungary has promised to send 15 types of ammunition totaling nearly 6 million units to Iraqi Kurds. Most of the ammunition, 4.1 million cartridges, was the M43 type for the AK-47 assault rifle.ROMANIAPrime Minister Victor Ponta said his country would offer 'logistic, operational and humanitarian' support to the coalition, but not troops. He provided no details of the assistance.POLANDPoland supports the coalition against the Islamic State, but is not actively engaged in combat. """	1.0
http://www.emergent.info/stainless-Apple-Watch-price	Claim: The stainless steel Apple Watch will be priced between $499 and $549 USD	true	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Price', 'Gene Munster', 'Piper Jaffray']	appleinsider.com	http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/03/02/piper-jaffray-pegs-stainless-steel-apple-watch-price-at-499-edition-at-4999	2015/03/03	"By Mikey CampbellMonday, March 02, 2015, 06:55 pm PT (09:55 pm ET)Investment firm Piper Jaffray issued a report on Monday breaking down expected Apple Watch average selling prices, saying an aggregate of consumers will likely spend closer to $550 on the device, considering case and internal storage options.Building off Apple's quoted starting price of $349 , analyst Gene Munster anticipates combined Apple Watch ASPs to fall closer to $550, or $575 to $600 including additional bands.Apple Watch will come in three separate price tiers —Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition —each series including two display sizes and a variety of strap choices.Starting with Apple Watch Sport, the aluminum and glass version widely thought to be the least expensive model, Munster expects an ASP of $450 after factoring in configuration alternatives like case and internal storage options.The stainless steel Apple Watch model, which also features a more expensive sapphire glass cover, is expected to start at $499 to $549, again depending on customizable features. Munster sees an overall ASP at around $650 for the mid-tier Watch series.On the high end, the analyst forecasts base model Apple Watch Edition devices to start at $4,999, but classifies segment ASP closer to $7,500 after adding in straps made from precious metals.Based on current pricing for Apple's silicon iPhone 6 cases, which come in at $35, Munster sees elastomer Apple Watch straps to start in a similar $29 to $35 range, while leather bands could be priced between $49 to $59. Pricing for metal bands like the link bracelet and Milanese loop are more difficult to determine, but the analyst believes steel versions will come in at $99, while gold bands could be priced into the thousands of dollars.""If you assume that 55 percent of bands purchased are elastomer, 35 percent leather, 10 percent steel, and about 5,000 total gold bands are sold, the average band ASP could be around $50,"" Munster writes.He added that if half of all Watch buyers purchase a band —assuming 8 million Watches are sold in 2015 —the accessory range would add $25 to Apple's watch category, equating to a $575 ASP. If every Watch customer purchases an extra strap, it would tack on $50, bringing ASP up to $600.The lower-cost Sport model is expected to make up 55 percent of overall Watch sales, while the mid-tier Apple Watch will take another 45 percent. That leaves very little room for Apple Watch Edition, but Munster believes Apple might sell roughly 10,000 units this year. In an interesting comparison, the firm calculates that Apple Watch Edition business could equate to about two percent of luxury watchmaker Rolex, which moves between 600,000 to 750,000 units each year.Finally, Munster expects Apple to reveal a better sense of device pricing at its March 9 event , as well as highlight ""special features"" to drum up consumer interest ahead of release.AppleInsider will be covering the ""Spring forward"" event live from San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center next week.Topics:"	1.0

http://www.emergent.info/Apple-Watch-diagnostics-port	Claim: The Apple Watch will ship with a diagnostics port	unverified	['Apple Watch', 'Matthew Panzarino', 'TechCrunch']	techcrunch.com	http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/05/would-you-buy-a-smart-band-for-an-apple-watch/	2015/03/05	Would you shell out money for a ‘smart’ accessory band for an Apple Watch that added additional capabilities? More battery life, perhaps? The reason I ask is that the Apple Watch has a port that the company has yet to show off. It’s being used for diagnostics and direct access to the Watch operating system, but it’s feasible that could be used to connect accessories in the future. The port has a 6-dot brass contact array inside the groove for the ‘bottom’ strap connector slot. Several sources have confirmed its existence and placement to me. It is very similar to the connector for the Lightning connector in iPhones, as that connector currently only uses 6 of its 8 available pins. Apple recently began opening up the Lightning port for use by third parties. A source says that this port is currently for diagnostic purposes only — but that there is nothing preventing it from being a connection port for future accessories. Let’s get this out of the way: As far as I know, smart bands will not be a part of the first Apple Watch version. But the existence of the port is interesting. Every millimeter of the Watch has been decided with purpose in mind. In a device so small and personal, you cannot afford to keep anything extraneous. Apple including this kind of port on what I believe to be the shipping versions of the Apple Watch means that it’s absolutely necessary in order to install the OS during manufacturing. Or for testing or debugging purposes — say, in an Apple Store. But that doesn’t preclude the possibility that it could be used to connect accessories in the future. Those accessories would likely take the form of bands that expanded the capabilities of the Watch in some way. One obvious way would be to include additional sensors in a band to gather more information about the wearer in health capacities. This could be a way to add sensors that measured stress, blood pressure and more — things the current version does not track. It’s also conceivable that a company like Mophie could build a Watch band that contained an additional battery for extended life (if Apple extends band manufacturing to other companies, which seems likely). Pebble recently announced a feature for its new Time watch called “Smartstraps,” which operates on the same principle. This first wave of the Apple Watch will be about seeing what developers can get it to do with apps. But, as we’ve seen with the iPhone, accessories are a big driver of Apple retail. Having accessories that not only augment the Watch aesthetically, but also operationally, would be big business. This kind of extensibility would be a great way to get around the “I just bought a watch for a couple thousand dollars that will be obsolete next year” problem. What if people that shelled out thousands could add additional capabilities by simply upgrading their bands? This wouldn’t help if most of the money you spent was on your hardened gold link band, of course, but it could alleviate the angst over having to replace a hefty investment down the road. While the port is on watches that are being used by Apple employees currently — there is always a possibility that the Watch version that ships to consumers won’t have this port at all (the Watch’s design has changed in small ways over the months since its announcement). There is also absolutely no guarantee that the port will ever be used for anything but diagnostics. But it’s still interesting that it exists — and to think about the possibilities. If you’re curious, the other slot has “Assembled in China – Designed by Apple in California” engraved inside. Update: Apple declined to comment on rumor or speculation. Update: A report from 9to5Mac suggests, as I noted was possible, that the port won’t be on the models that ship to consumers.This report was apparently referring to a Lightning port. The diagnostic port we mentioned above is both on Apple’s watches at the event (we checked) and in their videos released on the construction process. Update: A report from 9to5Mac suggests, as I noted was possible, that the port won’t be on the models that ship to consumers.	1.0
http://www.emergent.info/matt-Taibbi--first-look	Claim: Journalist Matt Taibbi has left First Look Media	true	['First Look Media', 'Matt Taibbi']	nymag.com	http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/10/matt-taibbi-disappears-from-omidyars-first-look.html	2014/10/28	"Matt Taibbi, the star magazine writer hired earlier this year to start a satirical website for billionaire Pierre Omidyar’s First Look Media, is on a leave of absence from the company after disagreements with higher-ups inside Omidyar’s organization, a source close to First Look confirmed today. (UPDATE: Taibbi has left the company. Taibbi’s abrupt disappearance from the company’s Fifth Avenue headquarters has cast doubt on the fate of his highly anticipated digital publication, reportedly to be called Racket, which First Look executives had previously said would launch sometime this autumn. When he was hired, amid much fanfare, Taibbi’s website was meant to be the second in an envisioned fleet of titles to be published by First Look, an ambitious digital journalism company funded by Omidyar, the founder of eBay and one of the richest tech moguls in America. Like its counterpart the Intercept, launched earlier this year by Glenn Greenwald and others to pursue investigations of NSA surveillance and the intelligence world, it was a venture centered around a brand-name polemicist without much management experience. Prior to joining First Look, Taibbi made his name by gleefully skewering fat targets for Rolling Stone — most famously, he described Goldman Sachs as “a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity” — and he said at the time of his departure that he was lured away by the chance to lampoon the financial industry in the “simultaneously funny and satirical voice” associated with the legendary magazine Spy. Over the succeeding months, the mission of the publication broadened to encompass political satire as well, and it brought on a number of high-profile names from the New York digital scene, including deputy editor Alex Pareene, formerly of Salon; Laura Dawn, a digital video producer who formerly worked with Moveon.org; and Edith Zimmerman, editor of the Hairpin. “Journalists should be dark, funny, mean people,” Taibbi told New York in an interview in March. Omidyar originally conceived of First Look as a network of interlinking sites run by ""independent"" journalists, many of whom took a similarly adversarial approach to journalism. Over the last year, however, the center of gravity of the organization has shifted, as Omidyar and his Silicon Valley braintrust have exerted control over budgets and vacillated over the journalistic mission. Over the summer, Omidyar appointed a longtime confidante, John Temple â€” a former newspaper editor who previously led an Omidyar-financed civic journalism venture in Hawaii â€” to be the president for audience and products, putting him in a position above Eric Bates, the former Rolling Stone editor who was brought on as a First Look editorial director, who is close to Taibbi. The confrontational approach that made Taibbi’s name at Rolling Stone â€” and before that, as a co-founder of the gonzo Moscow expatriate magazine The eXile â€” appears to have contributed to internal trouble at First Look. Sources confirmed that Taibbi has been absent from the office for several weeks, only returning on one brief occasion to address the staff. Although those hired have been reassured that the project would continue on during the unspecified term of Taibbi’s absence, the launch date for Racket — which Taibbi indicated in September would be coming “in a month” — now appears to have been pushed off. “We have a target date but I wouldn’t make a launch date public,” said Temple, who is based in San Francisco, when reached by phone this morning. “I don’t comment about internal matters and I don’t comment on personnel matters. Taibbi’s absence is only the latest in a series of shifts inside First Look, which Omidyar founded last year, originally in response to the disclosures of NSA surveillance leaked by Edward Snowden to Greenwald and his Intercept colleague Laura Poitras. Omidyar initially committed $250 million to the project and began laying plans for a large general interest website and a number of more narrowly focused “digital magazines.” In July, the billionaire announced he was scaling back the plan for the time being, choosing instead to focus on Racket and the Intercept as prototypes for a new technological model of journalism. The Intercept has lately been publishing vigorously, breaking several major stories — federal investigators are reportedly pursuing the alleged leaker responsible for a story on the site about the government’s voluminous terrorist watch list. But Racket has been much slower to materialize, leading to rumors of staff anxiety. In August, Temple told me Taibbi’s site was experimenting with a variety of journalistic approaches — not just satire and humor but also investigative journalism. For instance, Ellen Miller, head of the campaign finance watchdog the Sunlight Foundation — a nonprofit also heavily financed by Omidyar — met with the staff over the summer to discuss how it might dig into issues of money in politics. “We’re supporting Matt in creating something unique — and it’s Matt’s,” Temple told me. Taibbi’s clashes with those at the top are likely to drive further speculation about the fate of the long-incubating project and about the journalist’s own continued involvement. Nonetheless, the site is apparently still hiring. UPDATE:Â  Omidyar announced on Tuesday night that Taibbi has left the company. I regret to announce that after several weeks of discussions, Matt Taibbi hasÂ left First Look. We wish him well. Our differences were never about editorial independence. We have neverÂ wavered from our pledge that journalistic content is for theÂ journalists to decide, period. We’re disappointed by how things have turned out.Â I was excited by Matt’s editorial vision and hoped to help him bringÂ it to fruition.Â Now weÂ turn our focus to exploring next steps for the talented team that has worked to create Matt’s publication.

His son brought a ring to his class at Kermit Elementary School and told another boy his magic ring could make the boy disappear.Steward said the principal said threats to another child’s safety would not be tolerated – whether magical or not. Principal Roxanne Greer declined to comment on the matter.“All student stuff is confidential,” Greer said. She referred a call from the Odessa American to Kermit ISD Superintendent Bill Boyd, who did not return a phone call.Steward said he didn’t understand why his son was removed from school and why the district didn’t just send a letter home.He said he requested that the school send him “something in writing” saying that the school suspended his son and why they suspended him. Steward was told the school would put the letter in the mail.Steward said his son has attended Kermit Elementary since August. The 9-year-old has been in in-school suspension for referring to another student’s skin color and got in trouble for bringing a kids’ book about pregnancy to school.â€‹Follow Odessa American on twitterÂ  @OdessaAmerican , like us on Facebook at Odessa American Â or call 432-333-7714 for the main newsroom line.DiscussPrint	1.0
http://www.emergent.info/robot-security-guards-microsoft	Claim: Robot security guards are patrolling a Microsoft campus in Silicon Valley	false	['Microsoft', 'Robots']	extremetech.com	http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/194338-here-come-the-autonomous-robot-security-guards-what-could-possibly-go-wrong	2014/11/25	Here come the autonomous robot security guards: What could possibly go wrong?Here come the autonomous robot security guards: What could possibly go wrong?By Sebastian Anthony on November 17, 2014 at 8:58 amCommentThis site may earn affiliate commissions from the links on this page. Terms of use .Showing a rather shocking disregard for the long-term safety of human civilization, Microsoft has become one of the first companies to deploy autonomous robot security guards. Dubbed the K5, Microsoft’s Silicon Valley campus was being policed last week by five of these roughly human-sized 300-pound (136 kg) robots, each equipped with enough cameras, sensors, artificial intelligence, and alarms that they can replace most human security patrols. Fortunately, despite looking like uncomfortably like a Dalek from the Doctor Who universe, the K5 is not (yet) equipped with a ray gun or any other method for harming or detaining humans.Updated: Microsoft contacted ExtremeTech to tell us that the robots were only temporarily deployed at its Silicon Valley campus, as part of a demonstration put on by Knightscope. Microsoft PR says it isn’t “aware of any future plans” to deploy such robots.The K5 , built by the Californian company Knightscope, is billed rather euphemistically as an “autonomous data machine” that provides a “commanding but friendly physical presence.” Basically, it’s a security guard on wheels. Inside that rather large casing (it’s 5 foot tall!) there are four high-def cameras facing in each direction, another camera that can do car license plate recognition, four microphones, gentle alarms, blaring sirens, weather sensors, and WiFi connectivity so that each robot can contact HQ if there’s some kind of security breach/situation. For navigating the environment, there’s GPS and “laser scanning” ( LIDAR I guess). And of course, at the heart of each K5 is a computer running artificial intelligence software that integrates all of that data and tries to make intelligent inferences — like, should I tell HQ about that large gathering of teenagers, or should that man be climbing in through that window?K5 security robot. The lights can change color (red for trouble, orange for caution, etc.)If a K5 decides that there’s a situation, it can use one of its built-in sirens to try and diffuse things — or it can message HQ to summon a human. If you step in front of the K5, or otherwise interfere with it, it will gently warn you with some chimes — but if you don’t move, an “ear-piercing alarm” is triggered . Other than its sirens and its rather imposing design, the K5 isn’t equipped with any weapons or other tools for resolving situations. (Does anyone else think it looks like the lovechild of a Dalek and EVE from WALL-E?)A slightly odd photo of a US sheriff holding a gun to the head of a K5 robotK5 isn’t just for catching criminals, either: If you find yourself in trouble/danger, there’s also a button on the top of the robot that summons help from HQ.Read:  Microsoft wants to be part of Judgment Day, tooThe purpose of the K5, like most robots, is straightforward: To replace expensive human workers. The K5 can run for around 24 hours on a single battery charge, automatically navigates back to the charging point when it’s running low, and only takes 15-20 minutes to recharge. Obviously, in the long run, this is cheaper and more efficient than a human security guard — plus, as technology improves, the K5 will probably be more vigilant and capable of spotting smaller discrepancies than a human. In theory, because of the lower cost, you could also field lots of K5 robots, reducing the number of potential holes in security coverage.It goes without saying, though, that deploying a fleet of roughly human-sized, autonomous robots is just a little bit scary. At the very least, a 300-pound robot would cause a lot of damage if it ran into something — a car, a shop window, a child. In all likelihood, though, if these robotic security guards are popular, they’ll eventually be equipped with weapons — perhaps a taser for subduing a suspect, and a tear gas launcher for clearing groups of people. At that point, you need to be really sure that the AI is free of bugs.	1.0

The ongoing rodent problem at Vogue, however, might give some prospective tenants pause. Even Anna Wintour is worried.Multiple sources tell Gawker that the offices of Vogue, located on floors 25 and 26 of 1WTC, are dealing with a rat infestation. The infestation is so acute, one source said, that the fashion title’s editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, recently issued a standing order: Staffers must ensure that her personal office is rat-free before she enters it. (If you have any other details, do get in touch .)Update (3:05 p.m.): Another source with knowledge of the rat situation writes in:Sales/marketing is already in but editorial was supposed to move in Monday and they’re figuring out today if they’re pushing that back due to the infestation. A serious concern (laughable but I guess it makes sense) is all the clothing that could get nibbled through.The rodent invasion is particularly noteworthy given how much the magazine has been advertising its new digs on various social media channels, particularly Instagram :Here’s what Anna Wintour’s office looks like:Condé Nast did not immediately return a request for comment.Update (5:45 p.m.): Condé Nast has still not returned a request for comment.If you know more, send an email to trotter@gawker.com or hop in below.Photo credit: Associated Press	1.0

Barring any last minute problems, I would expect to see iOS 8.2 released this coming Monday, or the following week at the absolute latest.DONT MISS: Is the Galaxy S6 really an iPhone ripoff? Leaked comparison photo lets you be the judgeAdditionally, we were told there might be as many as four iOS 8.3 beta versions. Apple released iOS 8.3 beta 2 earlier this week, so that leaves two more versions before the company makes it publicly available to customers.iOS 8.3 adds support for multiple new features and is filled with improvements in the operating system, though the biggest addition is support for the upcoming Apple Watch, which is slated to be released in early April. Apples event on March 9th should answer our remaining questions on pricing and other details.Additionally, stay tuned for the first The Boy Genius Report podcast coming later today with some thoughts on Apple Watch, the Apple Car, my struggle with the iPhone 6 Plus, and other interesting topics. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTags: Apple, iOS 8.2, iOS 8.3 '	1.0
http://www.emergent.info/Apple-Watch-Edition-not-online	Claim: The gold Apple Watch Edition will not be sold online or by mail	unverified	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Edition', 'Grail Watch', 'Stephen Foskett']	grail-watch.com	http://grail-watch.com/2015/02/27/the-case-against-the-10000-gold-apple-watch-edition/	2015/02/27	b'My post laying out why the gold Apple Watch Edition must cost $10,000 caused quite a stir, but Ill be the first to admit that I could have it all wrong. Its entirely possible for them to put together a gold-cased Apple Watch for a much-lower price point, but Im much more interested in the reasons why: Apples manufacturing and retail empire would be seriously disrupted by a $10,000 lump of gold!Apple probably doesnt want to reconfigure their stored to resemble the Bank of England gold vaults! image CCbyND www.bankofengland.co.ukHow To Make A Gold Watch For Under $10,000In my last post, I pointed out (hyperbolically) that there are no gold watches available for less than $10,000. This isnt really true  there are a few small gold-cased watches available below that mark. But comparing these to an Apple watch is (if you pardon the pun), a case of apples and oranges: Theyre much smaller; theyre round; and theyre not Apple Watches!This last point is critical: We have no idea how the case of an Apple Watch is constructed. And, more importantly, the components, manufacturing, and sales process is entirely different from a Swiss mechanical wristwatch. My point was simply that Apples Watch Edition case looks like a big chunk of gold and thats an expensive thing, likely pushing the total cost all the way to $10,000 if my assumptions are correct.But lets say Apple didnt want to build, stock, and sell a $10,000 watch but still wanted it to be crafted from 18-karat gold. How would they do it?Our first argument against the $10k solid gold watch is commonality of design and certification. Apple has never (to my knowledge) delivered a device with different models constructed of different materials. Electronics arent like watches. They are mass-produced and must be certified for electromagnetic (RF) interference. Apple says theyll deliver Watches in aluminum, steel, and gold, but it would be much easier of all three had an identical internal design and only varied when it comes to the outer skin. (Counterpoint: Commonality inside doesnt necessarily mean cheap outside.)This would also make the final product much cheaper, since the gold case could be extremely thin and not structural. Note that nowhere does Apple use the term, solid gold case, to describe the Watch Edition. Im no lawyer, but their crafted from 18-karat gold boast could be weasel words to describe a conventional Watch wrapped in a thin gold skin.The lugs and bars (thats the watch insider term for the things that the strap attaches to) as well as the strap buckle could simply be gold plated or even gold colored. This is important because even these seemingly-small pieces would cost hundreds of dollars if they are solid 18-karat gold. Thats how expensive gold is.One big clue could be the missing gold bracelet. Its pretty glaring that the steel Apple Watch has two metal bracelets while the gold one only has leather and rubber. A gold watch bracelet has much more gold in it than the watch case itself, so the missing bracelet could be a clue that Apple is trying to keep the price in check. And the mere availability of the rubber strap which, as John Gruber notes, is the same as on the cheapest cheapie in the whole lineup could be another tell. Rubber bracelets are sometimes found on expensive dive watches, but this is no X Fathoms... (Counterpoint: They could add the gold bracelet later as an accessory.)Combine these clues and we could be looking at a much cheaper watch. Its still inconceivable to imagine prices less than $1,000, but Apple could definitely finagle a $2,000 Apple Watch Edition. Its more likely that the Edition would retail over $4,000, but this is a far cry from my earlier assertion that it would cost $10,000!Why Apple Wouldnt Want A $10,000 WatchIts entirely possible for the gold Apple Watch Edition to be way under $10,000, but a more important question is why would Apple do this. After all, those making the decisions are very familiar with the luxury watch market and the incredible prices that gold watches command at retail. Why wouldnt they want to pull a Vertu and cash in if customers are willing to buy?Lets return to the cost of gold. Although Apple has produced $10,000 products in the past and currently stocks some pretty expensive devices in the stores, a gold watch is an entirely different animal. Gold is much more fungible than anything else Apple sells, so security is a much more critical issue. Remember the smash-and-grab iPhone heists? How about that pallet of stolen iPhones? Now imagine if those thieves could melt the case down and have an untraceable $4,000 lump of gold instead of some hot electronics.The high price of gold affects every aspect of my purported solid gold Apple Watch. Where would Apple manufacture a $10,000 watch? Even that little buckle would be worth more than a months pay for a Foxconn assembly line worker. And the level of finish required to compete with Swiss watches is not yet possible at scale in China. (Counterpoint: Apple could build the solid gold Watch Edition in Texas alongside the Mac Pro.)Then theres shipment and warehousing. Although it is extremely unlikely that Apple would manufacture and ship the millions of gold Watches some analysts suggest, even more modest shipments would be immensely valuable. Securing these shipments from factory to warehouse to freight to warehouse to store will be a real challenge. Apple currently packs as many as 1.5 million iPhones into a single 747, but they couldnt ship $15 billion worth of Watch Editions this way! Every point of collection and shipping would instantly be a ripe target for criminals. (Counterpoint: Apple already deals with armored cars, security systems, and locked vaults.)Even the stores themselves would need to be reconfigured. Is Apple ready to add armed guards, armored display cases, and time-lock vaults to their stores? Certainly the smaller stores dont have space for a private room or boutique for Watch Edition buyers. (Counterpoint: We know they are working on a major redesign of the retail stores already.)And what about payment? Luxury watch buyers typically pay using wire transfers, not credit cards. Apple must prepare to process five-figure credit card transactions and accept wires. Are they ready to accept the hassle of validating buyers and payments of this size?Apple also has to worry about what a 1% product like a $10,000 Apple Watch Edition would say about the company and its buyers. As Adam Fields notes on Medium, Apple will have to abandon their historic focus on accessible luxury and fully embrace their new role as a vendor of conspicuous luxury. Already frequently criticized as a maker of status symbols, this would be a lightning rod for Apple: If the gold Watch Edition sells for $10,000, it could spike Apples broader reputation and turn away customers rather than attract them.Apple risks alienating their loyal customers with a 1% product. Could Occupy Apple become a reality? CC image by David ShankboneIt seems smart for Apple to skimp on the gold and bring the cost of the Apple Watch Edition to under $4,000. They would still have issues with production, shipping, and security but these would be reduced since they would no longer be dealing with four-figure lumps of fungible bullion.Yet even at that price the stores will need reconfiguration and the pundits will hurl jokes about the rich. If the company is going to suffer to bring out a gold Apple Watch Edition anyway, why not embrace the change and go solid gold?Thats why Im sticking to my original predictions:The starting prices will be $7,999 and $9,999The Apple Watch Edition will have a solid gold case weighing more than 5 ouncesIf sales go well, Apple will later offer a gold Edition bracelet at $9,999 as an accessoryThe Apple Watch Edition will be offered through certain high-end third-party fashion boutiques and retailersSome larger Apple Stores will add a private Edition Boutique (but not all)A whole line of expensive and exclusive Edition products will appearThe Edition line will not be available from the online store or by mailRelated Posts via TaxonomiesWhy the Gold Apple Watch Edition Must Cost $10,000A Watch Guys Review of the Apple WatchHow Good Is the Mondaine Helvetica Smart Watch?The Revolutionary Smart Watch from Apples Designers (Circa 1990)Hamilton Electric VenturaPatek Philippe 5015 Moon Phase Power Reserve: Calatrava PlusCould an Officers Watch Be the Ultimate Patek Philippe Calatrava?Patek Philippe Calatrava 5090J: The Russian WatchWhat If Your Company Gave You a Limited-Edition Gold Patek Philippe?What People Look For When They Look At WatchesYear: 2015Brand: AppleStyle: Smart watchCase: GoldCountry: USASource: Tags: Apple, Apple Watch, boutique, gold, retail, security'	1.0

The second militant was allegedly killed for dealing with the regime and throwing electronic chips to keep track of Mujahedeen.The electronic chips are understood to be a reference to electronic chips used for geo-location of targets in air strikes.There are unconfirmed reports that the men were beheaded, although Isis (also known as Islamic State) have also been known to crucify people.Charlie Winter, Programs Officer at counter-extremism think tank the Quilliam Foundation, said reports of Isis executing their own fighters are unsurprising.  He told The Independent: Isis is known for crucifying those who have tried to rebel against them.

Every guest is allowed to bring a plus one. A few years ago, when I was new in town, I got invited by a good friend, I shouldn’t say his name I guess,” said Perry, who also explained that “each year a new host is selected for the following year by drawing straws, you know? It is the new host’s responsibility to provide the main course, and it has to be human. If he can’t find a suitable person to serve as the meal… Well the joke, I think it’s a joke, is that the host will be eaten instead!““I was a bit squeamish about the idea of going to this dinner party, but when I heard who else was going I jumped at the chance. I was like, ‘People die all the time and their bodies just go to waste. If we can use their organs for medical purposes why shouldn’t we eat their meat?'”Asked what happened at the dinner party, Perry explained, “It was a huge, lavish feast. Oh my god. The featured dish was what they called Foie Humaine. You guys should appreciate that, being French. It’s a pun on foie gras, get it? But instead of force-feeding a duck and then eating it’s liver, this was the liver of a human who had force-fed themselves on junk food.”“A fatty liver fit for the kings of Hollywood.”Describing herself as “not terribly fond of organ meats,” Perry passed on the liver dish, but did enjoy sampling human flesh during the multiple course Bacchanalian feast.“It tastes like pork,” the singer explained of human meat. “But a little bit bitter, stronger.”Katy Perry promoting Illuminati symbolism.Katy Perry’s cannibalistic confession is merely the latest in a long line of public dalliances the singer has shared with the dark side. After starting her career as a Christian country singer, the she reinvented her image as a raunchy pop star, flashing Satanic hand gestures and promoting Illuminati symbolism as she rode to the top of the charts.Since establishing herself in the global consciousness as a Devil-worshipping entertainer, Katy Perry has attempted to sugar coat her image, however the disturbing conversation she held with the French radio host suggests she is far from a reformed character, and she has openly embraced the darkest forces in our society.The incident has also sparked fears around the world that the Illuminati have moved onto the next phase of the masterplan, and have begun openly promoting dark spirituality as a viable religious choice for those seeking guidance.	1.0

https://www.snopes.com/trump-rolls-back-rules-protecting-elderly/	Did President Trump Roll Back Rules Protecting Elderly at Nursing Homes?	true	['elderly', ' nursing homes', ' obama administration', ' trump administration']	https://www.nytimes.com/	https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/24/business/trump-administration-nursing-home-penalties.html	2017/12/28	Trump Administration Eases Nursing Home Fines in Victory for IndustryBy JORDAN RAUContinue reading the main storyPhotoSeema Verma, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, has said that the agency’s regulations were “taking doctors away from what matters most: patients.” Credit Al Drago for The New York TimesThe Trump administration is scaling back the use of fines against nursing homes that harm residents or place them in grave risk of injury, part of a broader relaxation of regulations under the president.The shift in the Medicare program’s penalty protocols was requested by the nursing home industry. The American Health Care Association, the industry’s main trade group, has complained that under President Barack Obama, federal inspectors focused excessively on catching wrongdoing rather than helping nursing homes improve.“It is critical that we have relief,” Mark Parkinson, the group’s president, wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump in December 2016.Since 2013, nearly 6,500 nursing homes — four of every 10 — have been cited at least once for a serious violation, federal records show. Medicare has fined two-thirds of those homes. Common citations include failing to protect residents from avoidable accidents, neglect, mistreatment and bedsores.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe change in policy aligns with Mr. Trump’s promise to reduce bureaucracy, regulation and government intervention in business.Dr. Kate Goodrich, director of clinical standards and quality at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in a statement that unnecessary regulation was the main concern that health care providers raised with officials.“Rather than spending quality time with their patients, the providers are spending time complying with regulations that get in the way of caring for their patients and doesn’t increase the quality of care they provide,” Dr. Goodrich said.But advocates for nursing-home residents say the revised penalties are weakening a valuable patient-safety tool.“They’ve pretty much emasculated enforcement, which was already weak,” said Toby Edelman, a senior attorney at the Center for Medicare Advocacy.Medicare has different ways of applying penalties. It can impose a specific fine for a particular violation. It can assess a fine for each day that a nursing home was in violation. Or it can deny payments for new admissions.The average fine in recent years has been $33,453, but 531 nursing homes amassed combined federal fines above $100,000, records show. In 2016, Congress increased the fines to factor in several years of inflation that had not been accounted for previously.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe new rules have been instituted gradually throughout the year.In October, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services discouraged its regional offices from levying fines, even in the most serious health violations, if the error was a “one-time mistake.” The centers said that intentional disregard for residents’ health and safety or systemic errors should still merit fines.A July memo from the centers discouraged the directors of state agencies that survey nursing homes from issuing daily fines for violations that began before an inspection, favoring one-time fines instead. Daily fines remain the recommended approach for major violations discovered during an inspection.Newsletter Sign UpPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The patient died.The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services fined Lincoln Manor $282,954, including $10,091 a day for 28 days, from the time the nursing home noticed the problem with the wound until supervisors had retrained nurses to avoid similar errors. An administrative law judge called the penalties “quite modest” given the “appalling” care.The fines were issued before the new guidelines took effect; if the agency had issued a one-time fine, the maximum would have been less than $21,000.Lincoln Manor closed in September. Its owner could not be reached for comment, and his lawyer did not respond to an interview request.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyAdvocates for nursing home residents say that relaxing penalties threatens to undo progress at deterring wrongdoing. Janet Wells, a consultant for California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform, said the changes come as “some egregious violations and injuries to residents are being penalized — finally — at a level that gets the industry’s attention and isn’t just the cost of doing business.”In November, the Trump administration exempted nursing homes that violate eight new safety rules from penalties for 18 months. Homes must still follow the rules, which are intended, among other things, to reduce the overuse of psychotropic drugs and to ensure that every home has adequate resources to assist residents with major psychological problems.In June , the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services rescinded another Obama administration action that banned nursing homes from pre-emptively requiring residents to submit to arbitration to settle disputes rather than going to court.“We publish nearly 11,000 pages of regulation every year,” the agency’s administrator, Seema Verma, said in a speech in October. That paperwork is “taking doctors away from what matters most: patients.”Janine Finck-Boyle, director of health regulations and policy at LeadingAge, a group of nonprofit nursing homes and other entities that care for older people, said the group’s members had been struggling to cope with regulations.“If you’re a 50-bed rural facility out West or in the Dakotas,” she said, “you don’t have the resources to get everything done from A to Z.”Jordan Rau is a senior correspondent for Kaiser Health News , a nonprofit news service covering health issues that is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation and not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.A version of this article appears in print on December 25, 2017, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Nursing Home Industry Wins As Penalties Are Relaxed.

While there was no confirmation, it was being tossed around that it was Barack looking to dump Michelle. This morning, a filing in the District Court of Cook County, Illinois confirmed that the couple is seeking divorce and that Barack is, in fact, the plaintiff.According to county docket D4610968L86, Barack Hussein Obama seeks dissolution of marriage from Michelle Obama on grounds of infidelity and irreconcilable differences. The infidelity, according to the Obama’s longtime housekeeper, Analita Consuelo Gonsales, isn’t recent but rather the revelation through a recent DNA test that Obama isn’t the biological father of Sasha or Malia.Gonsales said that it wasn’t really a surprise, because during an argument in 2003 Barack admitted to Michelle that he had faked all of his orgasms. Michelle, in turn, admitted that she had an affair with a biolab and that the children were actually the product of advanced genetic engineering. Apparently, Malia is secretly one of the most talented dulcimer musicians in the world and Sasha’s IQ is so high she’s a single lab accident away from being a supervillain and taking over the world.Obama, who suddenly feels like an outcast in a family of such amazing people, will step aside and even back Michelle’s 2020 run for president, but he will not agree to paying any form of support for Sasha, who is still a minor, mostly because she makes more money playing Texas Hold ’em in a month than he makes in a year.It’s lucky for us that we don’t have to have this kind of craziness in our White House anymore. Having a great, stable family like the Trumps is doing wonders for America.Join The Resistance And Share This Article Now!4.3k	1.0

While the concept of a child marrying an older man is creepy, isn’t it strange that these same people have nothing to say about Christian child marriages in the United States?On Friday, the New York Times published the heartbreaking story of Sherry Johnson.Subscribe to our Youtube ChannelJohnson was raped by a 20-year-old member of her church and became pregnant in Florida and learned very quickly that Christianity can be very cruel to its adherents.“It was forced on me,” she told the Times. See, authorities had begun sniffing around because she was pregnant with a 20-year-old’s child, so church official made the decision that the best way to avoid embarrassment was to marry her off to her rapist.Unfortunately, her parents were just devout enough to go along with this horrible plan:My mom asked me if I wanted to get married, and I said, ‘I don’t know, what is marriage, how do I act like a wife?’” Johnson remembers today, many years later. “She said, ‘Well, I guess you’re just going to get married.’”So she was. A government clerk in Tampa, Fla., refused to marry an 11-year-old, even though this was legal in the state, so the wedding party went to nearby Pinellas County, where the clerk issued a marriage license. The license (which I’ve examined) lists her birth date, so officials were aware of her age.Johnson was raped by both a minister and a parishioner, and the judge approved the marriage to the rapist who caused her to give birth at the age of 10 so that the investigation would end.“What we want is for you to get married,” the judge told her.“It was a terrible life,” Johnson says, noting that she missed school and spent her time changing diapers for what would eventually be nine children. Her husband would occasionally disappear and leave her to deal with everything.“They took the handcuffs from handcuffing him,” she says. How can this happen? Because it’s perfectly legal. In most states, it is perfectly legal for a man to marry a child. While some have at least passed laws limiting the age to 16 or 17 and above, most have no limit whatsoever.But Republicans are oddly resistant to progress. New Jersey lawmakers overwhelmingly passed a bill that would raise the age to 18, for instance. the bill made it to Gov. Chris Christie’s desk, but he vetoed it in the name of “religious freedom.”Child marriage, which the United States condemned in other countries as a “human rights abuse that contributes to economic hardship” in a State Department document last year, is a practice that must end.Featured image via The IndependentRelatedApparently the standard punishment is 'too harsh,' even though this man's actions are depraved beyond words.04/20/2017	1.0
https://www.snopes.com/billy-graham-statement-trump/	Billy Graham Issues Stunning Statement on Donald Trump	false	['billy graham', ' franklin graham', ' world politicus']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/o3YAz	2016/10/20	Tweet on Twitter  Trump is on target for what he promises to all Americans. The left isn’t that happy about the way he introduced the campaign, and told everyone that he dreams of big and safe America. Hillary’s supporters and the media came up with everything they could ever think of in order to get Trump out of the game. Not so fast, people! Your audio doesn’t mean a thing.Even Graham told everyone how he sees things, and that brought joy to everyone who cares about this country. Unlike people who hate Trump, he said a few good words that surprised us all. In a good way, of course. In your face, haters!Via Patriot JournalThey are epitome of hypocrisy. Most of the people decrying Trump give a pass to Bill Clinton, when as president he committed adultery with an intern. They continue to give a pass to Hillary, who protects her husband despite allegations of rape.And they ignore serious crimes Hillary committed when secretary of state.On the other hand, conservatives, who believe in such virtues as forgiveness, have been willing to look passed Trump’s remarks. We have enough common sense and decency to know everyone messes up, now and again, and needs our understanding and forgiveness.From Conservative Tribune:While the media couldn’t understand why, Rev. Franklin Graham did. He wrote a stirring Facebook post that moved Trump so much that he re-posted it on his Facebook account.“A lot of people are slamming evangelicals for supposedly giving Donald J. Trump a pass,” Graham began. “That’s simply not true. No one is giving him a pass. I’m certainly not, and I’ve not met an evangelical yet who condones his language or inexcusable behavior from over a decade ago.“However, he has apologized to his wife, his family, and to the American people for this. He has taken full responsibility. This election isn’t about Donald Trump’s behavior from 11 years ago or Hillary Clinton’s recent missing emails, lies, and false statements,” Graham continued.“This election is about the Supreme Court and the justices that the next president will nominate. Evangelicals are going to have to decide which candidate they trust to nominate men and women to the court who will defend the constitution and support religious freedoms.“My prayer is that Christians will not be deceived by the liberal media about what is at stake for future generations,” Graham added.The left don’t understand this, because they are mostly secular humanists. They are unable to appreciate such a powerful virtue as forgiveness, because they don’t believe in a God who can forgive our every trespass.They are under the delusion that you must be perfect or else. Either you live up to their warped standards or they’ll throw you under the bus. That’s what happened to Alec Baldwin a few years ago, when TMZ accused him of a homophobic remark. All his liberal buddies were quick to disown him, despite any real evidence.The left will never be able to understand, because they refuse to. They simply have their own agenda to protect, at all costs, and cannot conceive the ability to grow or change.Pro-Hillary Americans can’t understand that Trump is what this country needs. They are aware of his potential, but still refuse to admit it. Well, we know that, and we support Trump. Nobody cares about your opinion, Dems!What do you think about this?

Mary Lou Marzian, a Democrat from Louisville, proposed House Bill 369 in Feb. 2016 as a pointed statement to anti-abortion advocates, according to CBS News.The bill would have also required a man be married and make a sworn statement with his hand on a Bible that he will only use a prescription for a drug for erectile dysfunction when having sexual relations with his current spouse.My point is to illustrate how intrusive and ridiculous it is for elected officials to be inserting themselves into private and personal medical decisions, Marzian told Reuters.The proposal came days after Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin, a Republican, signed an informed consent law requiring women to receive counsel from a doctor 24 hours before having an abortion.Marzian told the Louisville Courier-Journal that the bill was a form of protest against the intervention into womens health by a predominantly male General Assembly.'	1.0

The Federal Government will make Marijuana a Schedule Two drug on August 1, 2016, effectively legalizing weed throughout the US.The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration will reclassify marijuana as a ""Schedule Two"" drug on August 1, 2016, essentially legalizing medicinal cannabis in all 50 states with a doctor's prescription, said a DEA lawyer with knowledge of the matter.Update 6/28: The Recreational Marijuana Initiative qualifies for the California's November Ballot. Will it be pre-empted by action of the DEA?http://www.smobserved.com/story/2016/07/04/news/dea-source-confirms-schedule-ii-medical-marijuana-is-in-the-works/1562.htmlThe DEA Lawyer had told the lawyer representing a DEA informant of the DEA's plan to legalize medicinal cannibis nationwide on August 1, 2016. When questioned by our reporter, the DEA lawyer felt compelled to admit the truth to him as well.""Whatever the law may be in California, Arizona or Utah or any other State, because of Federal preemption this will have the effect of making THC products legal with a prescription, in all 50 states,"" the DEA attorney told the Observer. Federal Preemption is a legal doctrine that where the US Government regulates a particular field, State and local laws are overridden and of no effect.He explained that ""there are five DEA schedules. Nothing on Schedule One is ever legal, and that is where Cannabis is today. Schedule Two drugs are available with a prescription.""On Schedule Two, marijuana will join drugs like Percocet, Aderall, Oxycontin, Hydrocodone and other drugs that are legal, even common, with a prescription. There are also other drugs that are not on any schedules but that are illegal on a federal level, he said. Drugs like aspirin and ibuprofen are available over-the-counter.He opined that the 135 medicinal cannabis clinic owners in Los Angeles will no doubt oppose this move by the Federal government, because the rule change will eliminate any reason for people to visit medical marijuana clinics. But they needn't worry. ""In my opinion, CVS pharmacy, Rite-Aid and Walgreens will sell Schedule Two THC products similar to what users call ""edibles,"" but will not sell smokable weed because of the health risk smoking anything entails,"" said the DEA lawyer.The Los Angeles based DEA Attorney who spoke to us, asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak to the press about the matter. He speculated that this action will be taken in the closing days of the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, so as to motivate the Democratic base to turn out and vote for Hillary Clinton, and other down ballot candidates. She will certainly not reverse this policy decision taken in the waning days of the Barack Obama administration, he said. But Donald Trump might.""Marijuana enforcement is a big drain on DEA resources,"" he said was another reason for the change, noting that 75% of the American public favor the legalization of marijuana for medical use.Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson is in favor of legalizing marijuana and in fact owns a business which peddles pot in New Mexico.California will vote on November 7th, 2016, whether to legalize the recreational use of marijuana. Because of Federal preemption, the DEA's reclassification of cannabis as a Schedule Two drug, will have the legal effect of requiring a prescription in California--i.e., it will continue the status quo.Since the Golden State legalized medical marijuana almost 20 years ago, Federal authorities have occasionally raided medical marijuana clinics here. They have forced major banks, like Bank of America, to close clinic bank accounts. The Feds have even seized real estate belonging to landlords who rent space to pot clinics. The Federal war on medicinal marijuana will abruptly end on August 1, 2016.UPDATE 6/19 9 a.m. PDT: The Denver Post is now reporting that the DEA could reclassify Marijuana as a Schedule II drug, as early as July 1, 2016. https://www.denverpost.com/2016/06/17/how-the-dea-should-classify-marijuana/UPDATE 6/22: The DEA wants to remove the barriers to cannabis research, a spokesman told aNewDomain in a lengthy interview. http://anewdomain.net/2016/06/21/on-cannabis-rescheduling-questions-the-dea-responds-exclusive/8/01 is the new 4/20!Medical cannabis, or medical marijuana, can refer to the use of cannabis and its cannabinoids to treat disease or improve symptoms; However, there is no single agreed upon definition, says Wikipedia. The use of cannabis as a medicine has not been rigorously scientifically tested, often due to production restrictions and other governmental regulations. There is limited evidence suggesting cannabis can be used to reduce nausea and vomiting during chemotherapy, to improve appetite in people with HIV/AIDS, and to treat chronic pain and muscle spasms. Its use for other medical applications, however, is insufficient for conclusions about safety or effects.In California, there are ""weed doctors"" who will write a prescription for cannabis to anyone claiming to suffer from anxiety, which means they passout prescriptions for pot like chocolate bars at a Halloween party. As with so many other trends that started in California, expect to see medicinal marijuana sold in your town soon!Medical cannabis can be administered using a variety of methods, including liquid tinctures, vaporizing or smoking dried buds, eating cannabis edibles, taking capsules, using lozenges, dermal patches or oral/dermal sprays. Synthetic cannabinoids are available as prescription drugs in some countries; examples include: dronabinol and nabilone.Recreational use of cannabis is illegal in most parts of the world, but the medical use of cannabis is legal in certain countries, including Austria, Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands (where it is also legal recreationally), Portugal and Spain.In the United States, federal law outlaws all cannabis use, while 25 states and the District of Columbia no longer prosecute individuals for the possession or sale of medical marijuana, as long as the individuals are in compliance with the state's medical marijuana sale regulations.The DEA lawyer gave us his legal opinion that if you happen to live where recreational marijuana is now legal, i.e. Colorado or Washington State; after August 1, you will need a prescription, as you would need throughout the U.S.However, an appeals court ruled in January 2014 that a 2007 Ninth Circuit ruling remains binding in relation to the ongoing illegality, in federal legislative terms, of Californian cannabis dispensaries, reaffirming the impact of the federal Controlled Substances Act.The Federal Government will make Marijuana a Schedule Two drug on August 1, 2016, effectively legalizing weed throughout the US. You may be able to buy pot at Rite Aid in Santa Monica by the end of the year.As explained above, moving marijuana from Schedule One to Schedule Two, would have the effect of legalizing medicinal marijuana, throughout all 50 States, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories. This action may be taken by the DEA unilaterally--i.e., without specific Congressional authorization -- because Congress has previously granted the DEA rule-making authority over what drugs are on which schedules.The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is a United States federal law enforcement agency under the U.S. Department of Justice, tasked with combating drug smuggling and use within the United States. Not only is the DEA the lead agency for domestic enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act, sharing concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), it also has sole responsibility for coordinating and pursuing U.S. drug investigations abroad.Update: DEA Source Confirms Story, 7/04/2016. http://www.smobserved.com/story/2016/07/04/news/dea-source-confirms-that-schedule-ii-marijuana-is-in-the-works/1562.htmlYou might be interested in:"	1.0

This is certain.Read our great constitution.In it, it states:— That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. —We can overturn the status quo, and create a country that offers hope rather than hate.	1.0
https://www.snopes.com/joakim-noah-west-point/	Joakim Noah Gives U.S. Soldiers the Finger, Refuses to Eat With Them?	mixture	['joakim noah', ' military', ' new york knicks', ' west point']	https://archive.is/	https://archive.is/ZWPs1	2017/05/09	NY NBA Star Gives US Soldiers The FINGER, Refuses To Eat With Them While Training At Military Camp1.2KSharesxSponsored by RevcontentWhat kind of asshat does this? Joakim Noah was training at West Point and then refused to eat with the rest of the New York Knicks with the cadets because he’s anti-war. Really? That’s about as rude as it gets. Those cadets are not the ones instigating war and if war comes, they will willingly serve to protect our country. You know, the one that makes it possible for this moron to earn $72 million over the next four years. What a jerk.I’m really getting sick to death of all these athletes taking their supposed political stances against the heroes of our country. These teams could step in and put a stop to this. Noah had the full support of his coach when he pulled this stunt. All of them are going to wind up getting boycotted and it serves them right. Saying that he “absolutely” understood Noah’s point of view, Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek explained:“Jo’s done, in all his stuff that he does against gun violence and all that, he just didn’t feel comfortable, so that’s plenty fine with us.”Do tell. Well, then the Knicks shouldn’t mind if their fans and the rest of America take a hike and take their money with them.From the New York Daily News:Joakim Noah violated one of the basic rules of guest etiquette this week by boycotting a team dinner with West Point cadets that featured a speech from a retired Army Colonel.As we all know, it’s never polite to insult your host.Noah is anti-war, which is great. Most right minded adults oppose war and that would include the young men and women at the U.S. Military Academy. You can still be a conscientious objector while earning $72 million over the next four years and still spend quality time with the people who are dedicated to serving and protecting the country.This could not have gone over well at the NBA league office where almost one year ago to the day Adam Silver announced that Gen. Martin Dempsey, the recently retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was appointed as a special adviser to the NBA Commissioner.For the last several years, Knicks players — who hold their training camp at West Point — have traditionally dined with cadets, listening to speeches from military officers and signing autographs. If you are in someone’s house, you honor them. Someone might want to tell this Noah idiot that.It figures this guy is a big fan of Barack Obama. Why am I not surprised? Noah’s stance has not prevented him from spending time with President Obama. In 2011, during Obama’s re-election campaign, Noah even joined several of his fellow NBA players at a fundraiser for the incumbent president. So, he’s a Marxist as well as anti-war. He’s the whole liberal package.Noah also applauded his fellow athletes who “are taking a stand,” saying that “this country’s out of control” and “there are things that need to be fixed.” Here’s a thought… if he can’t honor those at West Point, he should take his sorry ass and leave. He won’t be missed and at least one thing will be ‘fixed’.Sponsored by RevcontentTrending Today	1.0

In The NetherlandsDEA / L. ROMANO / Contributor / Getty ImagesJanuary 15, 2018    viewsThe mainstream media in the Netherlands reported last week that ""Noah"" was the most popular baby name for boys in the small European nation.""Noah and Emma were the most popular children's names in the past year,"" reported Nos.nl. ""This is evident from the annual list of names of the Social Insurance Bank, which pays out the child benefit. Boys were named Noah 635 times, while 755 girls went through life as Emma since last year."" The year before, ""Daan"" and ""Anna"" were the most popular names, the site said.But a journalist at Powned.tv did a little research on the report and found something completely different. Checking for ""Mohammed"" — and all its alternative spellings — the writer found that 636 babies had been given that name last year.""Mohammed (221 times) and all possible conjugations like Mohamed (211 times), Muhammed (110 times), Mohammad (51 times), Muhammad (43 times), Mohamad (unknown), Muhamed (unknown), Muhammet (not known), Mouhamed (not known), Muhamad (not known), Mahamuud (not known),"" wrote the reporter.The 636 variants of the name put it one ahead of ""Noah."" That makes ""Mohammed"" and its alternate spellings the most popular name in the Netherlands for the second straight year. In 2016, ""724 boys received the name (or one of the conjugations) from their parents,"" the site reported.And then there was this:""By the way, how do you think about the statistics in Great Britain and Wales? The British claim that Oliver is the name given most to newborn boys . In reality, this is ... Right, Mohammed or one of his conjugations,"" the reporter wrote, citing this article .The UK’s national statistics office recently released the latest data on baby names in England and Wales. It says the following: “Oliver remains as the most popular first name given to baby boys in England and Wales in 2016.” But that’s not really true. In fact, the most common name by far is Muhammad.So apparently you can't trust the mainstream media in the Netherlands, either.By Amanda PrestigiacomoWhat's Your Reaction?This page is forcing your browser to use legacy mode, which is not compatible with Disqus.

You may opt out at anytime. You also agree to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .The state’s health education glossary  defines gender as “A social construct based on emotional, behavioral, and cultural characteristics attached to a person’s assigned biological sex.” Gender expression, meanwhile, is defined as “The way someone outwardly expresses their gender.”These definitions differ from the state’s definition of “biological sex”: “Based on chromosomes, hormones, and internal and external anatomy.”Nathan Olson, a communications manager for the statewide Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI), told The Daily Caller that the glossary “was developed to support classroom instruction.” The new standards were finalized in March but OSPI has yet to issue a press release  informing the public of the changes.As part of an aspect of sexual health titled “Healthy Relationships,” kindergarteners will learn to distinguish between “safe and unwanted touch.” They will also learn to “Recognize people have the right to refuse giving or receiving unwanted touch.” OSPI did not answer a question from TheDC about whether this lesson plan amounts to teaching consent to kindergarteners.By third grade, students will be expected to “Explain that gender roles can vary considerably” and “Understand [the] importance of treating others with respect regarding gender identity,” as part of the “Self-Identity” component of sexual health.Gender identity is defined by the state as “Someone’s inner sense of their gender.”“The standards don’t define ‘gender spectrum.’ But self-identity is a key component,” Olson said when TheDC asked whether learning that gender is a “spectrum” is considered part of learning about “gender identity.” Last month, Fox News’ Todd Starnes described a Virginia county’s lesson plans on gender spectrum as “the idea that there’s no such thing as 100 percent boys or 100 percent girls.”That lesson plan– which was met with outrage from parents –was designed for middle and high school students.By fourth grade, Washington students will learn to “Identify how friends and family can influence ideas regarding gender roles, identity, and expression” and define sexual orientation. The state defines “gender roles” as “Social expectations about how people should act, think, or feel based on their assigned biological sex.”In fifth grade, students will learn to “Describe how media, society, and culture can influence ideas regarding gender roles, identity, and expression.” Under the guidance of school employees, fifth graders will also “Identify trusted adults to ask questions about gender identity and sexual orientation.” It’s not clear if parents are automatically considered “trusted adults.”By the end of elementary school (typically around age 11 or 12), students will be expected to “Understand the range of gender roles, identity, and expression across cultures.”In seventh grade, students will learn to “Distinguish between biological sex, gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation.” By eighth grade, students will be expected to “Recognize external influences that shape attitudes about gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation.”This education continues through high school where students will “Evaluate how culture, media, society, and other people influence our perceptions of gender roles, sexuality, relationships, and sexual orientation.”OSPI denied that the state intends to force a set of beliefs upon its students.“Standards help students become familiar with concepts that education experts feel are essential for all students to know,” Olson said. “Standards are not used to impose belief systems.”In response to a question from TheDC about whether a student who rejects the idea that “gender identity” is distinct from “biological sex” could end up failing a course on account of their beliefs, Olson said: “That would be handled at the district/school level.”He later admitted that “we don’t exactly know what a school would do if a student failed to complete an assignment because he/she opposed the materials being taught.”Olson said that the decision to implement specific “learning outcomes” lies with individual districts. Districts can craft their own curriculums, he said, as long as they “align with state learning standards.”The full health and fitness standards can be read here .Follow Peter Hasson on Twitter @PeterJHasson	1.0

The administration says if theres someone on the card you feel uncomfortable with, the student is encouraged to speak up.If there is an issue, if theres students that are uncomfortable or have a problem with another student, I mean: thats certainly something that can be addressed with that student and parents, Findlay said.However, Richard says rejection is part of life and at the end of the day, this policy is sending impressionable children the wrong message.Psychologically, my daughter keeps coming to me and saying I cant say \'no\' to a boy,"" she said. ""Thats the message kids are getting.""One of the concerns that Richard addressed with the principal at Kanesville Elementary is that parents werent aware of this policy.

https://www.snopes.com/photographs-show-dozens-dead-dogs-kuwait/	Bomb-Sniffing Dogs Killed in Kuwait?	mixture	['kuwait']	https://sofrep.com/	https://sofrep.com/57282/dead-working-dogs-piled-like-trash-contract-terminated-kuwait/	2017/08/22	By Desiree Huitt 06.23.2016 #Featured Email Share TweetThere are no happy stories of handlers being reunited with their working dogs in this article.Instead, there are only the deaths of at least 24 to 40 working dogs and the possibility of 90 additional dogs.  Eastern Securities or E Sec  was awarded a contract with Kuwait National Petroleum Company (KNPC) to provide explosive detection dogs for their oil rigs. When KNPC canceled the contract with Eastern Securities, they were left with 140+ dogs that no longer had a job and were costing them money to feed and house them. Instead of being responsible with the working dogs and finding them homes, Eastern Securities chose the most cost-effective way of dealing with the unemployed working dogs, euthanasia. It is unknown at this time exactly how the dogs were killed or even if the remaining 90 are still alive.Little to nothing can be done legally, the only thing that can come from this is a warning to companies that supply working dogs to security companies like Eastern Securities. Like many overseas security contractors, Eastern Securities purchased the trained dogs from a US company called  USK9 Unlimited, Inc .According to Mike Ritland, former Navy SEAL and owner of  Trikos International ,“The US is a major supplier of working dogs due to superior K9 training and quality of dogs found in the US. Once the dogs are sold, their fate is up to their new owners. That is why it is very important to check where and who the dogs will end up with. I have denied several dog requests from celebrities, security companies, and foreign governments in the past because I know that I cannot guarantee that the animals welfare and best interest are in mind.”In the featured image, you can see emaciated dogs. Mike Ritland, said,“It is not uncommon to have lean working dogs especially in a hot climate, but some of the dogs appear to be a little too lean. This does not happen overnight and could show further evidence of maltreatment and stressful living conditions.”USK9 Unlimited, Inc., released a statement on Facebook :“As President and CEO of USK9, due to many questions and statements regarding a Facebook post showing the massacre of dogs over in Kuwait, (a post shared on my personal Facebook page by a friend over in Kuwait), I felt obligated to post on behalf of USK9 in an effort to clear up any misunderstandings. Let me first state USK9 HAD NO PART OF SUCH AN INHUMANE ACT, if this alleged incident is in fact true, and has NOT done any business with nor been affiliated with this company “Eastern Security” for several years now.The original post shared on my timeline and some subsequent postings thereafter allege that someone intentionally killed multiple dogs and further blame “Eastern Security” (a security company operated in the country of Kuwait). According to these posts (and others) the alleged dog massacre occurred after “Eastern Security” allegedly loss a contract for security service in that country. Although I/we (USK9) have not made any such accusation(s), if these accusation(s) are proved to be true and accurate, USK9’s position shall be one of absolute condemnation of such a gross and vile act against defenseless animals. At USK9, we are true animal lovers and have always believed and treated each and every dog as “man’s best friend”. To see these type pictures simply makes all of us here sick to our stomachs.For the record, many years ago a successful and respected local business man (name withheld) here in Lafayette, La. reached out to USK9 with the prospect of he and his brother (“Bill Baisey residing in Kuwait”) starting a K9 security company to service the large refineries in Kuwait, using explosive detection dogs. Subsequently, USK9 entered into a contractual agreement with “Eastern Security” to sell trained explosive detector dogs and to help set up and train K9 teams for the “Kuwait Project”. In 2008, dogs were procured and trained by USK9 and sold to “Eastern Security”. Handlers employed by “Eastern Security” were sent here to Kaplan Louisiana (USK9) for certification for the “Project Kuwait”. The handlers for the “Kuwait Project” graduated in 2009. After a very long process, the Kuwait Project was completed and “Eastern Security” began operating as a stand-alone security company providing a K9 based security service to one or more oil refineries in Kuwait.USK9 ended up terminating the contract with “Eastern Security” shortly after it was up and running in Kuwait, due to what USK9 believed to be a breach of contract by “Eastern Security” on many issues to include but not limited to failing to make payments owed to USK9 for services rendered and other issues of conflict where one or more Kennel Master(s) and handler(s) that were employed by “Eastern Security”, began to raise questions about working hours, unfair wages, housing accommodations, delayed payroll issues etc.. USK9 was NOT aware of any abuse of animals during this time, otherwise would have reported such.USK9 has not had any dealings with or dog sales to “Eastern Security” in a few years now, ever since USK9 decided to terminate the contract and sever all ties with “Eastern Security”, which in light of this most recent alleged event, if true, will prove to have been a very wise decision. USK9 will monitor the developments of these allegations and will defend itself vigorously on anyone attempting to defame our impeccable reputation as a world leader in K9 training solutions.Respectfully,President/CEOUSK9 Unlimited, Inc.”SOFREP reached out to both Eastern Securities and USK9 Unlimited, Inc. but neither have responded yet. There has been a Facebook page created regarding this incident as the organizers of the page are trying to find vet care and homes for the 90 remaining dogs. Eastern Securities has not responded to their requests and inquiries of the remaining dogs as well.The Facebook page dedicated to helping the dogs also released a statement from a person who claimed to have worked for E Sec. In their statement they allege that not only does E Sec treat the dogs poorly but also might be involved in human trafficking:This is my story: I worked for this company for about 5 months in 2014 as an assistant program manager. Eastern Securities, a Kuwaiti contract company with an American owner, has killed the dogs left in their kennel upon losing the contract they had with the Kuwait National Petroleum Company. I can not get exact numbers, but the only witness that has exposed this says about 40 dogs. The owner of the company is Bill Baisey and his Program Manager is Tony Touchet . Both were aware of the murders of the dogs. The K9s were contract working dogs trained by a US company to do explosive detection at the oil drilling sites in Kuwait. The witness of this massacre is scared to come forward due to fear of being arrested in Kuwait. You see, in addition to killing these dogs, I believe Eastern Securities was also involved with human trafficking. I started to see the evidence of this when I worked there. In fact, Bill Baisey has been under investigation with his other company, Najlaa, and also with KBR for human trafficking charges. While I worked in Kuwait, many of the ES employees were not allowed to return to their home countries. Some had been away for many years. The company took their passports, held the sponsorships to their visas, and refused to let them go. If an employee went to the embassy, the company would lay a false charge or claim against them to get them arrested or “blacklisted”. Some handlers’ passports expired and they actually were thrown into a Kuwaiti jail for illegally being in the country when they finally got their passports back and tried to go home. While what happened to these dogs is sick and disgusting and inexcusable, what goes on in Kuwait regarding human trafficking is far worse. The public must understand that the employees who can testify for these dogs are all scared to death of their own fates at this moment. I started to pry into this issue while I was working there, but soon myself and the female office manager were being spied on. We were told that charges would be laid against us for bogus issues such as “having male visitors in our home” which is illegal and highly punishable for women in Kuwait. I left suddenly and quietly before I could be implicated or blacklisted or arrested. I stayed in touch with the handlers, and advised them as I could. Some have told me that a lawyer is working on this case for them. I am not sure what else can be done… As both Tony and Bill hold US passports, I would like to believe there is something the US government can do, but I am not sure what or who to contact. However, please believe… The story about the deaths of these CWD’s is true. This is the dirty, grungy side of animals for business. Even the “good” companies eventually have to sell their dogs to someone when their contracts are over, and then low-bidding companies like ES end up with the final say in their fate.Eastern Securities wants this issue to die, however, by sharing this article hopefully they will not win anymore contracts nor will companies be willing to sell them dogs.Image courtesy of Kuwait TimesIf you liked this article, tell someone about itAbout the AuthorDesiree Huitt Desiree Huitt is an Army Veteran serving 11 years as a Military Intelligence officer and prior to OCS as a combat medic.

She did it back in December, because she wanted to try it in a month where people “buy a lot of stuff”.Before becoming a sex-worker, she was an actress. But because she couldn’t find any good opportunity working as an actress, she decided to try this. But it went wrong.The woman got pregnant, and she wants to have the kid. But she doesn’t have enough money or resources to raise the chil, so she is filing for child support.“After all, this is HIS child. He has to take care of his child, even though he didn’t want to have it.”, the woman said to our reporter Gary Cockburn. She was very upset and angry, and refused to say anything else.On the other hand, the father of the child claims that “He didn’t know it was a real woman” and that he “avoids having sex with real women for this exact reason”.The case will be taken to court, as the man states that he is innocent and doesn’t want to have the child.“It was the most realistic sexual robot I had ever tried, until it wasn’t.”, said the man, disappointed.You can now write your own articles!

Upon conviction, the suspect is subject to up to 20 years in federal prison.The move passed the House with a historic unanimous vote of 435-0, skated through the Senate with another unprecedented vote of 100-0, and finally was signed into law in the very same day by President Trump.“At long last, we can all unite around our hatred for being forced to listen to sappy Christmas standards months before December 25,” a Congressional representative said. “While we may all disagree on just about every other social issue of our day, at least we can come together on this.”It’s great that our country can finally agree on something during these tumultuous times!SHARE	1.0
https://www.snopes.com/trump-sons-fundraiser/	Trump Sons Sell Access to Father for Hunting Trip Fundraiser	mixture	['donald trump', ' donald trump jr.', ' eric trump', ' hunting', ' opening day 45', ' trump sons']	https://exposingthebiggame.wordpress.com/	https://exposingthebiggame.wordpress.com/2016/12/18/hunt-with-the-trumps-for-1million/	2016/12/21	Donald Trump’s sons are looking to start the President-elect’s first full day in office with a bang. Following his inauguration, wealthy donors have the chance to go on a shooting excursion with Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump in a fundraiser, entitled ‘Opening Day’, honoring their father. For $1million, the top package offers a photo opportunity with President Trump for up to 16 people and a multi-day hunting or fishing trip with one or both of the Trump sons. Donald Trump Jr (left) and Eric Trump (right) are the stars of Opening Day, a fundraiser held in their father’s honor. Along with the event full of rich donors, Toby Keith, Alabama and other ‘surprise entertainers’ will be performing at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington DC onÂ Saturday, January 21. The attire for the fundraiser isÂ described as ‘camouflage and cufflinks… jeans, boots and hats are welcome’ and all proceeds will go to conservation charities. This isn’t the first time Donald Jr and Eric have shown their fondness for hunting, both domestically and internationally. In the past the two sons have come under fire for big-game hunting and posing with their kills, including Donald Jr smiling next a dead buffalo and in another holding up a tail of an elephant. Eric is pictured sitting on top of a water buffalo, with his hat hanging off its horn and three rifles propped up against the animal’s body. The two also have a photo that sparked outrage on social media where they proudly hold up a dead cheetah. In the past the two sons have come under fire for big-game hunting and posing with their kills. Trump turned to his children to boost support for his campaign and many political analysts think they aided to his win. Daughter Ivanka Trump played a large role in his campaign and was seen at her father’s side at conventions, rallies and debates. The 35-year-old is now the star of her own fundraiser, where a lucky bidder can have a 45 minute coffee break with the mother-of-three. The sit-down is estimated at $50,000 and once the bidder forks over the money to Eric Trump’s foundation and vetted by a background check, the two can chat about politics and life.	1.0

https://www.snopes.com/oklahoma-representative-god/	Did an Oklahoma State Representative Say Rape and Incest are the ‘Will of God’?	mtrue	['abortion', ' incest', ' oklahoma', ' rape']	http://www.patheos.com/	http://www.patheos.com/blogs/progressivesecularhumanist/2017/03/oklahoma-lawmaker-rape-incest-will-god/	2017/07/13	0 Comments{COUNT}Oklahoma State Rep. George Faught argues that rape and incest are the will of God while defending anti-abortion legislation.Tuesday the Oklahoma House approved House Bill 1549, also called the Prenatal Nondiscrimination act of 2017. The controversial legislation would prohibit abortion when the fetus is diagnosed with Down syndrome or any other birth defect.Discussing the legislation before Tuesday’s vote, Faught, the bill’s author, said when it comes to abortion, people are being allowed to play God.While discussing Faught’s legislation on the House floor Rep. Regina Goodwin asked :At what point did you decide that that’s within your ability to decide for all women in Oklahoma?Faught replied:One of the things that I campaigned on was to protect life, and I believe life begins at conception.At one point Rep. Cory Williams (D) asked Faught if rape is the “will of God.”Faught responded :Well, you know, if you read the Bible, there’s actually a couple circumstances where that happened. The Lord uses all circumstances. I mean, you can go down that path, but it’s a reality unfortunately.Williams followed up, asking if incest is the “will of God.”Faught said:Same answer. Doesn’t deal with this bill.Williams continued, asking why the bill does not include exceptions for rape and incest which are allowed in most anti-abortion legislation:You won’t make any exceptions for rape. You won’t make any exceptions for incest, and you are proffering divine intervention as a reason why you won’t do that.Williams Continued:I think it is very important (to know), do you believe rape and incest are actually the will of God?After a brief pause, Faught replied:You know it’s a great question to ask. And obviously if it happens in someone’s life, it may not be the best thing that ever happened, but — so you’re saying that God is not sovereign with every activity that happens in someone’s life and can’t use anything and everything in someone’s life and I disagree with that.Bottom line: For Rep. Faught, God is sovereign, and everything that happens is part of God’s plan – even rape and incest. Sounds like Faught’s God is a moral monster. Good thing God doesn’t exist, but it is terrifying that legislators like Faught are making laws based on their ridiculous and dangerous religious superstitions.(H/T Raw Story – Watch a video clip of the exchange between Faught and Williams below)Oklahoma State Rep.

She has allowed me to share her story. If you feel led, you can do the same<3""Hello, my name is Brianna, and this is my story.""Love is not the little things. It is not the phone calls, the dates, or even the memories. Love is knowing you would sacrifice things that you didn't even know you could sacrifice. Love is selfless.Have you ever felt your life shake ? Have you ever been hit with so much emotional turmoil to the point where everything around you becomes fuzzy and shaken? Your lungs feel tight and for a brief second you can't do anything. You are unable to move, unable to think, unable to even react. I have. I experienced something I never thought I would experience...all while nine months pregnant with my first child.Being pregnant is supposed to be one of the most amazing journeys you will ever embark on . You're creating a new life. You are experiencing unconditional love for someone you have not even met. Austin and I were so excited to meet our little boy. To bring him home. To be a family. I never imagined as I went to sleep that night, that my whole world would be shattered within hours. I still remember my mother in law waking me up that morning. ""Austin had an accident"" she said. All I knew was that my husband was in the hospital. The worst part? I didn't know why.After a two hour drive to the hospital, I learned that my husband, the father of my child, the person I am so deeply in love with, had had a brain hemorrhage. Why? The doctors concluded (after running his tox screen and ruling out drugs) that this horrible event was due to his recent excessive energy drink consumption (a habit he had built when he started working longer hours and commuting). Surgery was already in motion... and after an agonizing 5 hour wait, we got to see him. But while everyone was focused on the almost unrecognizable face hooked up to all sorts of machines and tubes, all I could see was his parents. I saw the light leave his mother's eyes as she saw her motionless son laying in that hospital bed. I saw his father break down crying as he held onto his wife. They didn't know if the life they created together would even wake up. Watching this family- my new family, who I have grown to love and be a part of, be so shattered and broken...that is the worst feeling I have ever felt.The next day was round two of brain surgery. Following this were strokes, seizures, swelling, and more things we weren't prepared for. There was a moment, sitting by his hospital bed, just praying he would be okay, that I knew I would never give up on him. No matter how messy our life would become. I was going to be by his side through all of it. After two weeks of living in a hospital, wondering if he would survive or be taken from us, we made our way back home. The time had come for me to deliver our baby.I'm not going to lie to anyone, it was so hard. I had planned on Austin being a part of this huge moment. Being by my side. Holding my hand. Being there to cut the cord. Being there to welcome our son into the world. It didn't feel right... But a beautiful miracle happened as I delivered our son. Austin woke up. I went about a week without seeing him. I thought about him every day. I cried as I looked at my child who looked just like his daddy. When the baby was only a week old, I left him with my in-laws. I knew I needed to see Austin. I needed to tell him that our baby was here. To tell him how much we needed him. Weeks went by. We chased him all over the state as more operations and procedures were ordered. I saw him every chance I got. At a little over 2 months old, our son finally met his dad. A day I wasn't sure I would ever see. That was the day that my heart gained some of its happiness back. Some time after that he could finally come home to me. Our life isn't normal. There are doctors visits and hospital trips- so many that I loose count. But we are here. Fighting. I wake up every day to take care of our beautiful little boy and my husband. I prepare the meals, do physical therapy, speech therapy, and occupational therapy. I help him with personal hygiene. I help him walk. I help him with every aspect of his life. And in between these tasks I take care of our very busy eight month old. It is hard, and I am tired, but we make the most of it. He isn't the same man I fell in love with, but I still fall further everyday, We are fighting to help him recover. To make his life better. One day we will get there. Until then, I will never give up on him. Because love is selfless, and I love him more than life itself.Photos courtesy of https://www.facebook.com/Endresphotography/"	1.0

He then retweeted a third titled: ""Islamist mob pushes teenage boy off roof and beats him to death!""Jayda Fransen, acting leader of the far-right organization Britain First, marches in central London on April 1. Getty ImagesKeep up with this story and more by subscribing nowFransen's Britain First is an anti-Islam, anti-immigration and nationalist political party. It is known for its anti-Islam political stunts, including ""invading"" mosques and launching ""Christian patrols."" The group has used social media to disseminate its message, posting anti-Islam and anti-immigrant propaganda on Twitter and videos of provocative stunts designed to antagonize Muslims on YouTube and Facebook. It has unsuccessfully contested elections for the House of Commons and the European Parliament, as well as the London mayoral elections. Fransen's tweets came days after she was arrested for comments made in a speech at a rally in Belfast, Northern Ireland, this summer. Fransen was in Belfast on August 6 for a demonstration by around 50 people calling themselves Northern Ireland Against Terrorism. Fransen  was found guilty of religiously aggravated harassment in November 2016 after making comments to a stranger during a ""Christian patrol"" in Bury Park, Luton, in January 2016. Fransen admitted telling Sumayyah Sharpe that Muslim men force women to cover up to avoid being raped ""because they cannot control their sexual urges,"" adding ""that's why they are coming into my country raping women across the continent.""Sharpe was with her four young children at the time. Fransen was fined nearly £2,000 ($2,680) for the incident. In August that year, Fransen and Britain First leader Paul Golding were banned  from the city of Luton and from entering any mosque in England and Wales for three years following an injunction from police who accused them of inciting ""community tensions.""In January they had marched through a part of Luton with a large Muslim community holding Christian crosses and handing out anti-Muslim pamphlets.  U.S. President Donald Trump answers questions about his response to the violence, injuries and deaths at the ""Unite the Right"" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, as he talks to the media in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York City on August 15. REUTERS/Kevin LamarqueIn June 2016, Tommy Mair shouted “Britain First” before shooting dead British Parliamentarian Jo Cox near Leeds in West Yorkshire. Britain First denied any connection to Mair, and Golding condemned the killing. Cox’s husband, Brendan Cox, criticized Trump Wednesday morning for what he said was legitimizing far-right politics.Television presenter and Celebrity Apprentice winner Piers Morgan, who has defended the president following past controversies and who Trump follows on Twitter, called for Trump to remove the retweets.British charity Hope not Hate, which monitors extremist organizations, said it ""beggars belief"" that Trump would retweet the material. ""Anyone with half a brain knows that Britain First is an extreme right movement that has had links to Loyalism, claims to 'invade' mosques, used murdered British soldier Lee Rigby’s name against the wishes of his family to help it campaign in elections, and has bought many of its supposed followers on social media,"" a spokesperson told Newsweek.  Fransen celebrated the president’s apparent show of support. According to social media monitoring site SocialBlade, Fransen had 52,700 followers before Trump's retweets. At the time of writing, this had risen to 54,100, an increase of almost 1,500 in less than an hour.Trump faced widespread criticism after August's white supremacist Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, when he blamed ""both sides"" for unrest which saw anti-racism protester Heather Heyer killed. The Trump administration has attempted to impose a ban on residents from several Muslim majority countries entering the U.S., citing security concerns. The Southern Poverty Law Center has attributed a threefold increase in the number of Islamophobic crimes in the U.S. in 2016 to Trump's anti-Muslim rhetoric on the campaign trail. Trump has a record of disseminating information from dubious sources which have trafficked far-right conspiracies, on Saturday praising the Magapill website for an article lauding his achievements. The site had previously tweeted a ""flow chart"" which claimed Jews and the Vatican control the world.  "	1.0

Do you support Americans for Prosperity? Are you a member of the California Republican Party, which has a platform approving of all forms of energy, including fossil fuel (oil)? Do you work for a gas station, an oil company, have your written a letter to the editor in favor of oil drilling?” asked Mr. Frank in a May 31 post.“If so, you could find yourself with being charged in a court of law, thanks to SB 1161,” Mr. Frank said.California Attorney General Kamala Harris belongs to a coalition of 17 state attorneys general that joined forces in March to pursue climate-change skeptics, starting with ExxonMobil.The bill declares that there is no legitimate disagreement on the causes and extent of climate change, stating that, “There is broad scientific consensus that anthropogenic global warming is occurring and changing the world’s climate patterns, and that the primary cause is the emission of greenhouse gases from the production and combustion of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas.” Read the whole thing...	1.0

Let us explain.Thirty years ago, Pat Nixon caught Donald Trump on Phil Donahue’s TV show — because of course she did — and she was very impressed with what she saw. So impressed that her husband, the former president, went out of his way to write the young tycoon a note .In 1987, the Nixons predicted @realDonaldTrump would win whenever he ran for office. Photo courtesy @nixonfoundation #PresidentElectTrump pic.twitter.com/hICGWZL6MJ— Archives Foundation (@archivesfdn) November 9, 2016In typical Nixon fashion, he begins by saying that he didn’t actually see anything.“I did not see the program,” wrote Nixon. “But Mrs. Nixon told me you were great.”Then a bit of friendly encouragement:As you can imagine, she is an expert on politics and she predicts that whenever you decide to run for office, you will be a winner!In a Trumpian flourish, Nixon underlines “great” with a pen — though come to think of it, Trump might have done that one himself.At least now we can stop blaming Obama and his White House Correspondents’ Dinner speech for spurring on Trump to run.Sources	1.0

Similarly, the population of those whose families came from Africa stands at around 750,000, a 46 percent increase since 2011.TRENDING: Former Today Show Staffer Comes Clean on Disturbing Lauer EncounterAbout 1 million of those migrants from the Middle East or Africa arrived in Germany as part of the wave of refugees in 2015 and 2016.Meanwhile, and potentially entirely unrelated … the U.K. Daily Mail just reported on a substantial rise in cases of bestiality within Germany over the same time period, so much so that “animal brothels” have actually become a thing.Advertisement - story continues belowYes, you read that correctly — bestiality , also known as zoophilia, the practice of humans having sexual relations with animals, is a growing trend and “lifestyle choice” in the prominent central European nation.A livestock protection and animal welfare officer named Madeleine Martin is now warning government officials that laws must be put in place to stop the rapid spread of these brothels that allow and encourage people to have sex with animals.As an example of the growing trend, Martin pointed to a particular farmer with a flock of sheep who noticed that his animals had become increasingly skittish around people.The farmer had surveillance cameras installed on his property, and lo and behold, caught several men entering his barn at night to engage sexually with his flock.Advertisement - story continues belowMartin stressed that this was but one example of many similar cases she has compiled all across the country, and she wants the government to do something about it.It is worth noting that bestiality was once illegal in Germany, but the law banning it was dropped from the books in 1969.RELATED: Student Kneels for Pledge…Then Gets First-Hand Lesson in CivicsThere had been talk in 2016 of reinstating the ban, but Martin is done with mere talking and is demanding that changes be made to the national Animal Protection Code to do just that — protect the animals from abuse by sexually deviant people.The chairman of the agricultural committee, Hans Michael-Goldman, said changes could be made in the laws to forbid the use of animals “for individual sexual acts and to outlaw people ‘pimping’ creatures to others for sexual use,” which would effectively ban the “animal brothels” or “erotic zoos,” as some call them.Advertisement - story continues belowViolation of the newly proposed ban would likely result in a fine equivalent to more than $30,000 for a first offense, increasing thereafter. Of course, proponents of bestiality have vowed to fight any ban with legal challenges of their own, so we will have see how that plays out in court.H/T DangerousPlease share this story on Facebook and Twitter to spread the word about the significant increase in bestiality and “animal brothels” in Germany — occurring at the same time the country has seen a vast influx of migrants and refugees.What do you think of the rise of bestiality in Germany?

https://www.snopes.com/federal-judge-rule-police-can-legally-shoot-kill-dogs/	Did a Federal Judge Rule Police Can Legally Shoot and Kill Dogs?	mixture	['cops shooting dogs', ' dogington post', ' fourth amendent', ' legal for cops to shoot dogs']	http://www.dogingtonpost.com/	http://www.dogingtonpost.com/federal-court-ruling-police-can-shoot-a-dog-if-it-moves-or-barks-when-officers-enter-a-home/	2016/12/28	b'19749SHARESFacebookTwitterSubscribeA ruling by the 6th Circuit Federal Court in Michigan last week gave police nationwide the authority to shoot a dog if it moves or barks when officers enter a home.The decision stems from a 2013 incident in Michigan where police shot and killed two dogs while executing a search warrant looking for drugs inside the home of Mark and Cheryl Brown. Following the incident, the Browns filed a petition with the court to hold the officers and city of Battle Creek responsible for the deaths of their dogs.One officer testified that he shot the first dog after it had only moved a few inches in a movement that he considered to be a lunge. The dog then ran away from the officer to the basement, where it was shot again and killed.The second dog was shot in the Browns basement after it was simply barking at the police, court documents said. The officer testified that after he shot and killed the first dog, he noticed the second dog standing about halfway across the basement, the courts opinion explained. The second dog was not moving towards the officers when they discovered her in the basement, but rather she was just standing there, barking and was turned sideways to the officers. The same officer shot the dog twice before a second officer didnt want to see it suffer, so he put her out of her misery and fired the last shot, killing her.Given the totality of the circumstances and viewed from the perspective of an objectively reasonable officer, the dog poses an imminent threat to the officers safety, Judge Eric Clay wrote in the decision.  The standard we set out today is that a police officers use of deadly force against a dog while executing a search warrant to search a home for illegal drug activity is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment when...the dog poses an imminent threat to the officers safety.According to court documents (below), the ruling allows for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments.View the court documents here:Court documents noted that the officers were aware, by a Beware of Dogs sign posted outside the home, verbally from the dogs owner, and by personally witnessing the dogs through a window before entering, that at least two dogs were present inside the home.According to court documents, federal courts have also ruled that the unreasonable killing of a dog does constitute a destruction of property under the Fourth Amendment.Still, in this case, the court sided with the officers.19749SHARESFacebookTwitterSubscribeRelated Items:battle creek police vs. mark brown, cops shooting dogs, featured, federal court rules police can shoot dogs that barkRecommended for you  Kids Playing with Phone Dial 911, Marinette Police Officer Shows Up & Shoots Their Dog  Deputy Shot Family Dog While Delivering Protection Order to Wrong Address  Police Shoot, Kill Puppy While Serving Warrant at Neighbors House 39 Comments39 Comments Pingback: Two Dogs Shot - This is Terrible... - PupBuzz Karen Wainwright Jan 17, 2017 at 9:30 pm Nine year dog bite study results:**Lethal dog bites count for 1/1000th of 1% of deaths.(There are roughly 70-80 million dogs in the USA and about 320 million people.

Its a dogs nature to protect. What dog ISNT going to move it bark when a stranger comes into their home? This needs to be challenged. I understand the safety of the police is important but this is absurd. Police killing pets that arent even aggressive has gotten out of control.Reply kathy Dec 31, 2016 at 12:47 am maybe officer training needs to include something on learning the body language of dogs to determine if the dog is just barking or means to attack. And what would happen if a 5/6 yr. old kid grabbed a pair of scissors and ran at the officers yelling at them? would the officer shoot the kid? After all its a threatReply Kathy P Dec 30, 2016 at 3:19 pm This is WRONG and a crime! To me, this amounts to the murder of a family member. That would be like saying a citizen could shoot a K9 officer, if he/she barked. Both the furry family member and the K9 officer are doing what they would do naturally. Surely this ruling can be retracted. Who would come up with such a heinous idea?Reply Natasha Dec 30, 2016 at 2:05 pm Absolutely despicable! Id like to shoot the officers who did that!Reply Melissa Glenn Dec 30, 2016 at 1:52 pm These kind of killings of dogs is outrageous. If cops are so afraid to deal with dogs non-lethally then they should call animal control before entering the premises. This is just bad training on the police forces part and there are many other ways a police officer could have dealt with this. These kind of killings show what these types of police officers are ... SAVAGES!!! Just because they hold a badge doesnt make them any different than felony animal abusers.Reply Joan Dec 30, 2016 at 12:02 pm Another example of complete broken society! Every time an officer is called to action there should be an officer with skills to keep within the the law using common sense to protect all involved. Killing dogs just to relieve any obstacle is so wrong. Children may be in the home and if so, they will be trying to protect thier pet. And the pet is there to protect the fsmily. This law is inhumane and stupid. Using the word STUPID is the only word that describes this law. Dumb would be another word to use!!!!Reply Ken Burritt Dec 30, 2016 at 10:35 am That just enabled every evil, trigger happy cop to needlessly execute non threatening dogs. What a travesty of justice.Reply Tammy Wellock Dec 30, 2016 at 8:40 am Tjis cant happen again. A petition needs started and signed by the masses against this action, the judges decision and that animals have rights! They were murdered in their own home with plenty of knowkwedgr the dogs were in the house before entering and liking them. This is a classic example of cops who love to kill and give good cops a bad name. They are dangerous men who have no business wearing a badge and carrying a gun!!Reply Susan Dec 29, 2016 at 11:36 am I have registered my dogs because they are service dogs with my local police department . If they come to my house I can guarantee its my accident or for a medical emergency . None the less if its a police offficer, fireman, or EMT I do not want them to have a fear of my ver large dogs I want them to know they may bark but they are friendly and will take your commands . And most importantly will go to a room were they can close them into a room where all will be safe.. I go out at every chance for the fireman, EMT and the Policeman to meet my guys at all community activities.Reply JP Dec 29, 2016 at 9:56 am This is absolutely the most ridiculous law! Dogs get excited and protective when people they dont know enter their house. To say its ok for an office to shoot a dog for barking, is saying its ok to shoot a dog for simply being a dog. The broad sense of this law pretty much gives police the ability to shoot a dog at will after entering anyones house because a normal dog will likely bark and/or run to see who it is. This needs to be changed immediately!ReplyPingback: Did a Federal Judge Rule Police Can Legally Shoot and Kill Dogs?  snopes.com Robelle Dec 28, 2016 at 8:58 pm My dog has 2 teeth left and is barely two inches off of the floor. He barks at everyone he doesnt know. To him, he is just protecting me and the home he lives in when his previous owners neglected him and left him alone. By the time we got him, he was terrified of everybody and was skin and bone. Any stranger who appears as a threat to him would be barked at. This is a ridiculous court ruling.Reply Sandie Abel Dec 29, 2016 at 8:45 am Cops are supposed to serve and respect. Most of them do.

My dog is family and I would not want her shot simply by barking, she is just doing her job by alerting me that someone is near.Reply Dee Dec 27, 2016 at 11:47 pm I am a law abiding citizen. How does this happen? We have lost control. For one judge to put this into law, says a great deal. The only thing a law like this will lead to is anger and civil unrest. Its not just the lack of common sense, its the shear arrogance. Whats next?Reply Nancy Sellars Dec 27, 2016 at 10:30 pm This new law is so wrong. I am completely dumbfounded by it. All the officers have to do is use common sense. If there is a sign saying Beware of dog then proceed at your own risk OR call out, announcing your presence. If a dog rushes at you, again call out. And killing a dog on a leash or tether is just plain stupid! Why would you do that? Use COMMON SENSE! Stop murdering our dogs.Reply Dustina Dec 27, 2016 at 4:27 pm I am blind and my dog is a guide dog and he cost $60,000. If the place where the sheriff come to my house to issue divorce papers and my dog barks nearly to alert me that there is someone at the door and I opened it with the police officer shoot my Dog? Please officers arrest people who shoot their service dog and issues jail sentences up to 40 years, can I have them arrested and them sentenced to prison for 40 years for shooting my service dog?Reply K9 Dec 27, 2016 at 12:13 pm Your all right this entire thing is Bullshit, it is bey6ond me when animal have been elevated to the same level as humans and in some cases beyond. Were there children in the house, how about older people who were being neglected? Nobody even considered that there was a legal search warrant to drug issued. Everyone said that dogs just bark, can you tie the two together. Dogs in a suspect drug house, wonder why, while it isnt the dogs fault that they were there it certainly isnt outside of the realm of possibility the dogs were there as a warning for those who were strongly suspected of doing illegal activities, strongly enough for a search warrant to issued. I am amazed that people are willing to even consider dying, and leaving, leaving all the people who love them and that they love to saw and animal or to even consider the though of killing another human because they have killed an animal. If police had said lets just have open season on dogs and start shooting them randomly then that is one thing. However I am willing to bet that these were not lap dogs, they were in a house that was a suspected drug den people, I am will to bet that they were not golden retrievers or a St. Bernard, for those of you who didnt read the entire court ruling they were pit bulls, and belonged to a know gang member. While pit bulls can be a highly faithful and family friendly breed when purchased from a reputable breeder, I highly doubt that these were of that pedigreed. Common sense should tell you that these dogs were not family pets. The were there for one thing and that isnt to protect that family, they were there to protect drugs. All the dogs in the world are not worth one human life. Dogs can be great companions and add a lot to the lives of their owners but dont kid yourself into thinking that that was the reasons these dogs were around. Also consider that these dogs were shot in the LAWFUL search of a know gang members/drug dealers house. If you dont put YOUR dogs in a criminal situation then YOU wont have to worry about police shooting them.Reply Cheryl Dec 27, 2016 at 2:47 pm That is basically what this IS. SHOOT FIRST ask questions later. You can taze a charging dog just like an unarmed person.You come into my house and murder my dog, Im shooting back.Reply Linda Dec 27, 2016 at 5:36 pm K9- what about the family dog that was killed when the police entered the house with a search warrant- BUT IT WAS THE WRONG HOUSE! (It has happened.) Police officers need to use common sense. A dog will bark- as everyone has said and police should know that. I am also pro-police, but I am not for murdering animals because they bark. This is one of the reasons police get a bad rap by so many people- their indiscriminate shooting of living things.Reply diana Dec 28, 2016 at 12:04 am From my understanding thus was a wrong addressReply Ash Dec 27, 2016 at 10:44 am Dont worry everyone. As humans we are going to be extinct soon because of law makers like these judges. Soon there will be a law that if you fart or even make a micro expression on your face for a fart, in front of a cop then you will be shot in your head. So take care with your dog and also the fart. Stupid and ridiculous law.Reply James Snow Dec 26, 2016 at 11:18 pm If a police officer shot my dog no matter what the reason, he best find a new home off planet earth, because I am not resting in this life until i do the same to him. I would not think twice, I would not even think about it, I would do him in the same manner. No remorse no way would I ever let that go on answered.Reply Paul and Ella Craddock Dec 27, 2016 at 3:58 pm I feel the same toward this stupid shit. I (Ella) retired Police Officer wouldnt want this Bullshit law. They are only trying to get more Police Officers killed. President Trump needs to get this reversed. Probably Obama stirring more problems before he goes out or he wouldnt have let this happen.Ella CReply Mike Dec 26, 2016 at 8:33 pm Ask some Law Enforcement K-9 units to see this as an acceptable procedure.Every year pet owners, worldwide, spend billions of dollars. This judge should consider the revenue from taxes, jobs created, license fees, and veterinarian services. Add to it service dogs for the blind, emotionally, physically handicapped. Rescue K-9 units, drug sniffers, bomb sniffersWhat we need is, less decision makers like this judge and some sensible use of deadly force protocols.To expect any dog, which most responsible pet owners consider a family member, to be still and not bark when a stranger enters their residence is ridiculous. It goes against the very nature of canine behavior.Reply Brenda Dec 26, 2016 at 4:46 pm Are they frigging kidding me my dogs bark if someone comes near my house or comes in...this law is redicilous.

Whoever pulls a trigger in the direction of my dogs better be prepared to do the same to me.

It's called the one cup tip. You put a cup of water in your freezer. Freeze it solid and then put a quarter on top of it and leave it in your freezer. That way when you come back after you've been evacuated you can tell if your food went completely bad and just refroze or if it stayed Frozen while you were gone. If the quarter has fallen to the bottom of the cup that means all the food defrosted and you should throw it out. But if the quarter is either on the top or in the middle of the cup then your food may still be ok. It would also be a great idea to leave this in your freezer all the time and if you lose power for any reason you will have this tip to fall back on. If you don't feel good about your food, just throw it out. The main thing is for all to be safe. Please SHARE this on your page.	1.0

Want to make sure you sit next to your children on a flight? On some airlines, there’s a fee for that.Now, on United Airlines, you won’t necessarily get the use of an overhead bin without paying more money.The overhead bin: “one of the last sacred conveniences of air travel,” as an angry Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) put it Sunday as he denounced the move.Of course, the airlines, when they come up with a new fee for something that was once free, always say that’s not what they’re doing. They’re just creating a fare tier that does not include it.As part of the company’s new pricing tier, Basic Economy , passengers who purchase the airline’s cheapest fares will only be allowed one personal item that must fit under a seat. Additionally, customers will not be assigned seats until the day of departure, meaning people on the same ticket could be separated.The move marks the first time a large U.S. airline limits low-fare customers to one carry-on bag that fits under a seat, Reuters reported. The company expects such fare initiatives to add $1 billion to its annual operating income by 2020, as more customers pay to check luggage or select higher fares for two carry-on bags.Of course, next to cable providers, airlines are the companies Americans love the most to hate. Many on Twitter saw United’s new tier as a mere invention.And the constant nickel-and-diming has led passengers to ask: What will airlines begin to charge for next? Cushions? Oxygen masks?“Maybe it will be extra for sitting soon,” tweeted one disgruntled flyer.“Seriously!?!

But not everyone who thinks they understand GcMAF therapy gets it. Many are using hugely too much and hurting children in the process. Please don’t overdose the children – if you are using the right GcMAF it takes very little to help. Our process involves homeopathic activation using classical techniques.  And when our techniques are used properly this is what we are hearing from the families so often.Dear Dr. Bradstreet,What has happened to my child? Could it be that it was only a few months ago that my little boy preferred sitting alone at the computer or lining up toy cars and planets in his room? It seems like it’s been a lifetime. Now, I look at my happy, interactive, responsive, 6 year-old child with amazement.“J” began using GcMAF since 27 weeks ago and we noticed changes for the better almost out of the starting gate. Only 3 weeks in, my son asked to ride his bike. My husband and I looked at each other with dread. Unfortunately, in the recent past it took all three of us to make that bike go. My husband and I would use our hands to push his feet on the pedals while one of us attempted to steer. It was a backbreaking ordeal. Our son just couldn’t coordinate the mechanics of it. But, not this time…he jumped on that bike and rode all over the neighborhood. We couldn’t believe our eyes. Could it be the GcMAF? We just weren’t sure.The IEP meeting was scheduled. We were just 4 weeks into the new school year and 4 weeks into using GcMAF. The teacher presented me with written work from the beginning of the year, then placed Jayden’s most recent work alongside it. Surely, it was from two different children. The earlier writing was erratic, with one letter written over top of the other, it was disproportionate, and trailed sloppily down the edge of the page. His recent work was neat, orderly, and consistently sized. It was even on the line. The teacher started gushing about his performance. He was starting to read and was learning full curriculum kindergarten academics. He was specifically excelling in math. Everyone around the conference table verbally gave each other a high-five for their achievement. “Now hold on,” I interrupted, “the success must primarily be attributed to the biomedical approach and the diet that we’ve implemented.” I gave them a brief explanation and we left the meeting feeling excited for what the future might hold.It was not a steady climb up the staircase, however. We experienced some regression following dental surgery, but quickly got back on track (by resuming GcMAF).Previously, I had a difficult time getting my son to respond when I called out his name. He would run out into the street without looking, if I didn’t stop him. He was able to parrot back canned answers to rehearsed questions. Now, here we are, 6 months later, and my son’s cognition has exploded. He laughs at jokes and is able to tell his own. He has started to ask and answer questions cognitively. He initiates and organizes the family during playtime activities. Recently, while in the pool, he touched his Dad’s hair and said, “Nice haircut, Dad.” At breakfast, after drinking his juice he asked, “Was that mango juice? I wanted pear juice.” The morning after I went to see a show he awoke and said, “Good morning Mommy. How was the show?” Just 2 months ago, a van from a local karate school brought children to the playground that we were at. My son was excited to play and ran over to a boy and gave him a two-handed chest shove. I apologized and quickly led him away before he got a karate chop. Just last week, we went back to that same playground. I watched nervously as “J” ran over to a group of three boys. I heard him say, “Come on guys, let’s play. Chase me!” And, you know what…they did! My boy led this group of “normal” boys all over that playground. One of the boys asked him what was his name. He told him, “My name is J***.” As I glanced around at the other parents scattered about the playground I wondered if I was the only one there who saw a miracle that day.My son did experience some symptoms while using GcMAF. There was occasional regressive stimming, a rare fever up to 102, a few shooting head pains with sensitivity to light that lasted for only a few seconds, and he was often tired. But, those symptoms were easily lost in the shadows of the exceptional gains that we were experiencing.The best part about GcMAF is that Jayden now frequently and spontaneously speaks those words, that for years, I’d longed to hear, “I love you, Mommy.” And, if that’s not a good enough reason to stick your kid with a needle 27 times, I don’t know what is.Dr. Bradstreet, there are no words adequate enough to express my sincere and heartfelt appreciation for everything that you’ve done for “J”. Thank you for including us in your personal journey of discovery and healing. God bless you and your family.Sincerely,Dr. Bradstreet’s #1 FanShare this:	1.0

It may have eyes set in his chest. It is described as a 7-foot-tall (2.1 m) creature, with long wings and huge red eyes. It possesses an unusual shriek.On November 15, 1966, two young couples from Point Pleasant, Roger and Linda Scarberry, and Steve and Mary Mallette, along with their young cousin, Lonnie Button, were traveling late at night in the Scarberrys’ car. They were passing the West Virginia Ordnance Works, an abandoned World War II TNT factory, about seven miles north of Point Pleasant, in the 2,500 acre (10 km²) McClintic Wildlife Management Area, when they noticed two red lights in the shadows by an old generator plant near the factory gate. They stopped the car, and reportedly discovered that the lights were the glowing red eyes of a large animal, “shaped like a man, but bigger, maybe six and a half or seven feet tall, with big win gs folded against its back,” according to Roger Scarberry. Terrified, they drove toward Route 62, where the creature supposedly chased them at speeds exceeding 100 miles per hour.A Mothman sighting was again reported on January 11, 1967, hovering over the town’s bridge, and several other times that same year. Fewer sightings of the Mothman were reported after the collapse of the town’s bridge, the Silver Bridge, when 46 people died. The Silver Bridge, so named for its aluminium paint, was an eyebar chain suspension bridge that connected the cities of Point Pleasant, West Virginia, and Gallipolis, Ohio, over the Ohio River. The bridge was built in 1928, and it collapsed on December 15, 1967. Investigation of the bridge wreckage pointed to the failure of a single eye-bar in a suspension chain due to a small manufacturing flaw. There are rumors that the Mothman appears before upcoming disasters and seems to try to warn people of them. Mothman was never again seen in Point Pleasant after the demolition of the Silver Bridge.John Lepper from New YorkAnother VersionOriginal PostThe Mothman is a creature reported in the Charleston and Point Pleasant areas of West Virginia between November 12, 1966, and December 1967. It’s described as a winged, man-sized creature with large reflective red eyes and large moth-like wings. Sometimes it appeared to have no head, with its eyes set into its chest.On November 15, 1966, two young, married couples from Point Pleasant, David and Linda Scarberry and Steve and Mary Mallette, were traveling late at night in the Scarberrys’ car. They were passing the West Virginia Ordnance Works, an abandoned World War II TNT factory, about seven miles north from Point Pleasant, in the 2,500 acre  McClintic Wildlife Station, when they noticed two red lights in the shadows by an old generator plant near the factory gate. They stopped the car, and reportedly discovered that the lights were the glowing red eyes of a large animal, “shaped like a man, but bigger, maybe six and a half or seven feet tall, with big wings folded against its back”, according to Roger Scarberry. Terrified, they drove toward Route 62, where the creature supposedly chased them at speeds exceeding 100 miles per hour. However, as quoted in Keel’s The Mothman Prophecies, the Scarberrys, despite driving more than 100 miles per hour, claimed to have noticed a dead dog on the side of the road, and in fact made such accurate note of its location that they claimed to have gone back the very next day and looked for it. Explanations for how they were able to make so accurate a mental note at a time of such great distress, or why they would go back to look for the dead dog, are not included in Keel’s book.The following night, on November 16, several armed townspeople combed the area around the TNT plant for signs of Mothman. Mr. and Mrs. Raymond Wamsley, and Mrs. Marcella Bennett, with her infant daughter Teena in tow, were in a car en-route to visit their friends, Mr. and Mrs. Ralph Thomas, who lived in a bungalow among the “igloos” (concrete dome-shaped dynamite storage structures erected during WW-II) near the TNT plant. The igloos were now empty, some owned by the county, others by companies intending to use them for storage. They were heading back to their car when a figure appeared behind their parked vehicle. Mrs. Bennett said that it seemed like it had been lying down, slowly rising up from the ground, large and gray, with glowing red eyes. While Wamsley phoned the police, the creature walked onto the porch and peered in at them through the window.On November 24, four people allegedly saw the creature flying over the TNT area. On the morning of November 25, Thomas Ury, who was driving along Route 62 just north of the TNT, claimed to have seen the creature standing in a field, and then it spread its wings and flew alongside his car as he sped toward the Point Pleasant sheriff’s office.On November 26, Mrs. Ruth Foster of Charleston, West Virginia reportedly saw Mothman standing on her front lawn, but the creature was gone by the time her brother-in-law went out to investigate. Further, on the morning of November 27, the creature allegedly pursued a young woman near Mason, West Virginia, and was reported again in St. Albans the same night, by two children.A Mothman sighting was again reported on January 11, 1967, and several other times that same year. Fewer sightings of the Mothman were reported after the collapse of the Silver Bridge, when 46 people died. The Silver Bridge, so named for its aluminumn paint, was an eyebar chain suspension bridge that connected the cities of Point Pleasant, West Virginia and Kanauga, Ohio over the Ohio River. The bridge was built in 1928, and it collapsed on December 15, 1967. Investigation of the bridge wreckage pointed to the failure of a single eye-bar in a suspension chain due to a small manufacturing flaw. There are rumors that the Mothman appears before upcoming disasters, or that the Mothman causes disasters.Share this:	1.0

USA TODAYFernley City Council is discussing allowing a medical marijuana dispensary in the city.(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORETwo poison control doctors claim to have documented the first known case of death by marijuana overdose , sparking a medical debate over what killed an 11-month-old baby in Colorado two years ago.The case report was published in the journal Clinical Practice and Cases in Emergency Medicine and is co-authored by a pair of doctors at the Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center, which is housed at Denver Health.The doctors behind the case report, Doctors Thomas Nappe and Christopher Hoyte, worked on the baby’s care as part of their duties at the regional poison control center. They claim that damage to the child’s heart muscle, which was listed as the boy’s cause of death, was brought on by ingesting marijuana. This is the first news story in which either of the doctors publicly discussed the case that was published in a medical journal in March of this year.More: Nevada pot sales reach $32.4M in August, higher than July“The only thing that we found was marijuana. High concentrations of marijuana in his blood. And that’s the only thing we found,” Hoyte said. “The kid never really got better. And just one thing led to another and the kid ended up with a heart stopped. And the kid stopped breathing and died.”The case report makes what amounts to a very bold statement in the scientific world, “As of this writing, this is the first reported pediatric death associated with cannabis exposure.”If correct, the phenomenon Dr. Hoyte claims to have documented would remain the only time a marijuana overdose is known to have caused a human death.Other doctors are deeply skeptical of the strong language used in the report.CLOSESince Nevada legalized recreational marijuana, anyone 21 and over can possess up to 1 ounce in-state. How many people actually could look at an ounce and identify it, though? We're here to help educate you. Jenny Kane/RGJ“That statement is too much. It’s too much as far as I’m concerned,” said Dr. Noah Kaufman, an emergency medicine specialist based in Northern Colorado. “Because that is saying confidently that this is the first case. ‘We’ve got one!’ And I still disagree with that.”It’s widely accepted as fact that marijuana overdoses are not fatal. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration fact sheet on pot says simply that “no death from overdose of marijuana has been reported” and the National Institutes of Health says there is “insufficient evidence” to link THC overdose to fatalities.The claim that an overdose death happened in Colorado has the potential to change the way people think about the steady march toward marijuana legalization in the U.S.The controversyBoth published accounts of this case clearly state that the autopsy shows that the 11-month-old boy died of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) which caused the heart to fail.The Nappe/Hoyte published case study takes the diagnosis a step further, theorizing that the myocarditis was caused by cannabis overdose, which then caused the baby boy’s heart to fail.That diagnosis of this heart condition is at the core of the medical debate over this case study. Myocarditis is rare in children, and can often be fatal when diagnosed. In children, fatal myocarditis is usually caused by a virus called Coxsackievirus. The authors of the case report say that virus was ruled out in this case.CLOSEA recent poll says Americans believe marijuana is less harmful than opioids in pain relief, but are less comfortable with its use by children and pregnant women for medical conditions. WochitMyocarditis has a long list of other known causes, mostly from infections by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites.“We extensively ruled out almost every other cause that we can think of,” Dr. Hoyte said. “Myself, our team, plus the primary team taking care of the patient, plus the coroner who did the post-mortem on the child. And we found no other reason why this young kid ended up having inflammation on his heart.”Drs. Hoyte and Nappe both worked on the case as physicians on staff at the poison control center.More: New 'Potcast' to dive into how marijuana legalization is changing AmericaWe do not know if this case has led to a criminal investigation. Hoyte and Nappe declined to share the identity of the deceased child or even the name of the hospital in Colorado where the death took place, for fear of revealing his identity. They report finding a “high concentration” of THC (the psychoactive drug found in marijuana) in the child’s urine and blood. Short of that, they have no evidence that explains the child’s death. “We just wanted to make sure that we’re not going to call this a marijuana-related fatality if there was something else that we could point at. And we looked and looked and couldn’t find it,” Hoyte said.Their case report points to other research that shows myocarditis as a symptom associated with THC consumption, but those cases involved the presence of other drugs and do not propose a mechanism by which marijuana might bring on myocarditis.None of those cases involved fatalities.This hints at a scientific limitation of this study. The doctors don’t have a proof-positive way to demonstrate that marijuana caused the death in this 2015 case.What they can do is demonstrate a presence of marijuana in the boy’s system, and that they ruled out a lot of other possible explanations for his death.“The child didn’t leave the house between being normal and being sick. The child had THC in the blood and in the urine and there were marijuana products in the house,” Hoyte said. “I feel very comfortable with the workup that we did and how much we ruled out in this particular case.”This conclusion leaves other doctors curious, but skeptical that this truly is the world’s first documented death by marijuana overdose.This child’s death in 2015 was previously noted in a 2016 paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association — Pediatrics. In that paper, written by Dr. George Wang of Children’s Hospital Colorado, said that marijuana could not be determined as the cause of myocarditis in this case. However, Dr. Wang says that his study focused on a wider review of years of data and not the relationship between this type of heart problem and evidence of marijuana found in that boy’s system.Multiple ER doctors and medical researchers were interviewed for this story. Many praised the Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center as a top-tier institution for researching the issue, but none accepted this case as bulletproof evidence of a marijuana overdose death, though some were more open to the idea than others. One spoke on the record.“I’m going to have to call ‘BS’ on this one,” Kaufman said. “I’m not saying that it’s not. But I think it’s a pretty big leap to say that it is.”Other possible causesWhile the study notes that the child tested positive for marijuana and that his case involved “an unstable motel-living situation and parental admission of drug possession, including cannabis,” the doctors admit in their published report, the myocarditis could have been caused by something doctors can’t test for. “A lot of the times [the cause of myocarditis is] infectious. Or unknown,” Hoyte said.Dr. Kaufman agrees about the number of unknown causes of myocarditis.“[Hoyte] may be pretty confident,” Kaufman said, “But I’m not. I think that it’s more likely that there’s not a relationship.” “There’s so many things that cause the problem that this poor baby had, that we’re not even close to saying it was definitively a marijuana overdose,” Kaufman added. “Allergies can cause this. What if the kiddo was allergic to the carnauba wax, or whatever is in the gummy that’s not the marijuana?”Kaufman also points out that there are thousands of known cases of accidental ingestion of marijuana by kids of all ages and while symptoms can be bad, none of those cases have proven fatal. To him, that suggests there may be some other reason that a small segment of the population is more sensitive to overdose on THC than most people. The case report on this death itself is missing some key information.Hoyte and Nappe wrote that the boy ate an “unknown dose of THC,” and said they aren’t sure exactly what product was involved or precisely when he ate it. Based on the blood levels of THC metabolite they found, the doctors estimate that consumption took place 2-6 days before death.Some context and adviceDoctors on both sides of the debate agree on what parents should learn from this case. It’s the same advice they’ve given since marijuana first became legal in Colorado: keep it away from kids. “Even if I’m not convinced that it could kill your kid, you need to be really careful because it could make them really sick,” Dr. Kaufman said. “It needs to be locked up away in a medicine chest because it can cause seizures. It can cause real big problems in kids that can lead to other problems.”Concerned parents can also learn the warning signs for marijuana ingestion, which include lack of balance, unusual and sudden sleepiness, and breathing difficulty, according to Children’s Hospital Colorado.Hoyte and Nappe report that this baby displayed those symptoms for a day or so before he had a seizure and went to the ER.Colorado has taken recent steps aimed at preventing accidental ingestion by children. In the years since legalization, the state has imposed new restrictions on the potency and design of edible marijuana products. New rules that took effect last month ban edibles that resemble existing non-marijuana candies and also bans shaping edibles in the form of people, animals, or fruit. Dr. Hoyte was careful to point out that even though he does believe THC led to this death, there are plenty of more harmful substances parents also need to worry about. “We’re far more concerned about opioids in that case of a kid getting really sick than we are of marijuana,” Hoyte said.Even if Hoyte and Nappe’s determination is confirmed, it’s worth noting that we would have more confirmed deaths from swallowed laundry and dish detergent pods than from marijuana, according to poison control researchers at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.The doctors who spoke agree further study may be warranted, including animal testing, to shed more light on possible links between myocarditis and marijuana. More post-mortem studies of the heart tissue from cannabis users who pass away could also be useful, Hoyte suggested. However, he says that if he’s right, this phenomenon may be extremely rare.Cases of kids ingesting cannabis have increased since Colorado legalized the drug, but Hoyte admits pot may not be causing enough serious health complications to study these issues extensively. “We’re not getting calls from kids getting sick from marijuana or even adults getting sick from marijuana—getting sick to the point of having bad outcomes,” Hoyte said. “We’re not getting these every single day. They’re very few and far between.” Was this a rare case of marijuana death, or something else?“We may never know, really,” Kaufman said. CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://www.rgj.com/story/news/marijuana/2017/11/16/colorado-doctors-claim-baby-boy-first-marijuana-overdose-death/870700001/From The USA TODAY NETWORKThese sites are part of the USA TODAY NETWORK.

When confronted, the two men pushed their way through the crowd and ran.The issue became such a blatant betrayal of our electoral system that now it seems entire precincts could lose their ballots. One poll worker in Birmingham’s 412th told Breitbart :“We were a little bit suspicious of some of the people coming in, but they had what looked like valid IDs. We checked their pictures and signatures and they seemed to match, but let’s be honest…it can be hard to tell them apart.”She also reiterated that the reason there were no Republican poll watchers in their precinct was because they were “too afraid” to come after being told to leave their firearms at home.The FEC getting involved is a serious matter. It also means President Trump isn’t satisfied that this election went off fairly. Early in the reporting, the Moore campaign announced they had broken every voting record ever set in Alabama, yet suddenly they lose? It doesn’t make sense.We’ll keep you updated on this developing story. 	1.0

This left-side bias holds true for both men and women and it also applies to the skin cancer melanoma. Researchers Orjan Hallberg of Hallberg Independent Research in Sweden and Ollie Johansson of The Karolinska Institute in Sweden, writing in the June issue of the journal Pathophysiology, suggest a surprising explanation that not only points to a common cause for both cancers, it may change your sleeping habits.  For unknown reasons the rates of breast cancer and melanoma have both increased steadily in the last 30 years. Exposure to the sun elevates the risk of melanoma, but the sun's intensity has not changed in the last three decades. Stranger still, melanoma most commonly affects the hip, thighs and trunk, which are areas of the body protected from the sun. What is responsible for the left-side dominance and increasing incidence of these cancers?  An intriguing clue comes from the Far East. In Japan there is no correlation between the rates of melanoma and breast cancer as there is in the West, and there is no left-side prevalence for either disease. Moreover, the rate of breast cancer in Japan is significantly lower than in the West; only 3 percent of what is seen in Sweden, for example. The rate of prostate cancer in Japan is only 10 percent of that in the U.K. and U.S.  The researchers suggest an explanation based on differences in sleeping habits in Japan and Western countries. Previous research has shown that both men and women prefer to sleep on their right sides. The reasons for this general preference are unclear, but sleeping on the right side may reduce the weight stress on the heart, and the heartbeat is not as loud as when sleeping on the left. Still, there is no reason to suspect that people in Japan sleep in positions that are any different from those in the West. The beds in Japan, however, are different. The futons used for sleeping in Japan are mattresses placed directly on the bedroom floor, in contrast to the elevated box springs and mattress of beds used in the West. A link between bedroom furniture and cancer seems absurd, but this, the researchers conclude, is the answer.  The first line of evidence they cite comes from a 2007 study in Sweden conducted between 1989 and 1993 that revealed a strong link between the incidence of melanoma and the number of FM and TV transmission towers covering the area where the individuals lived. Despite epidemiological correlations like this one suggesting the possibility that electromagnetic radiation from FM and TV broadcasts stations could suppress the immune system and promote cancer, the strength of these electromagnetic fields is so feeble it has been difficult to imagine any biological basis for the correlation.  Consider, however, that even a TV set cannot respond to broadcast transmissions unless the weak electromagnetic waves are captured and amplified by an appropriately designed antenna. Antennas are simply metal objects of appropriate length sized to match the wavelength of a specific frequency of electromagnetic radiation. Just as saxophones are made in different sizes to resonate with and amplify particular wavelengths of sound, electromagnetic waves are selectively amplified by metal objects that are the same, half or one quarter of the wavelength of an electromagnetic wave of a specific frequency. Electromagnetic waves resonate on a half-wavelength antenna to create a standing wave with a peak at the middle of the antenna and a node at each end, just as when a string stretched between two points is plucked at the center. In the U.S. bed frames and box springs are made of metal, and the length of a bed is exactly half the wavelength of FM and TV transmissions that have been broadcasting since the late 1940s. In Japan most beds are not made of metal, and the TV broadcast system does not use the 87- to 108-megahertz frequency used in Western countries.  Thus, as we sleep on our coil-spring mattresses, we are in effect sleeping on an antenna that amplifies the intensity of the broadcast FM/TV radiation. Asleep on these antennas, our bodies are exposed to the amplified electromagnetic radiation for a third of our life spans. As we slumber on a metal coil-spring mattress, a wave of electromagnetic radiation envelops our bodies so that the maximum strength of the field develops 75 centimeters above the mattress in the middle of our bodies. When sleeping on the right side, the body's left side will thereby be exposed to field strength about twice as strong as what the right side absorbs.  If this study is correct, the solution is simple: Replace the metal in our beds with a nonmetallic mattress or orient your bed, like an antenna, away from the direction of the local FM/TV transmission tower. Call it high-tech feng shui if you like, but if this new study has not identified the cause of left-side cancer, it will, for some, be the cause of insomnia. ABOUT THE AUTHOR  R. Douglas Fields, Ph.

According to police, upon asking Pablo for his license and registration, Pablo allegedly reached into his pocket to pull out his wallet, but instead pulled his hand out to reveal the “finger circle”, a very popular hand game that has no clear origin, and is played by making a circle with your thumb and index finger and then placed below the waist like this:If someone looks at the finger circle, you are allowed to hit that person or simply feel the pleasure of having tricked that person into looking at it.After showing the officer the finger circle, the officer punched Pablo in the face and pulled him from inside his vehicle and arrested him for obstruction. “My whole life i’ve been tricked into looking at that thing” said the CPD officer who arrested Pablo, “I was tired of that damn circle. Back in middle school some kid knocked me out because I looked at it”.Pablo will reportedly spend New Year’s day inside jail until his $5000 bail is paid.	1.0

This was just 4 days before he would have turned 101 years old.Family released a statement saying he “went comfortably and was in no pain” and “lived a long and prosperous life that people only dream of.”Kirk Douglas was an American actor, producer, director, and author. He was one of the last living people of the film industry’s Golden Age. After an impoverished childhood with immigrant parents and six sisters, he had his film debut in The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (1946) with Barbara Stanwyck. Douglas soon developed into a leading box-office star throughout the 1950s and 1960s, known for serious dramas, including westerns and war movies. During his career he appeared in more than 90 movies. Douglas was well known for his explosive acting style.As an actor and philanthropist, Douglas had received three Academy Award nominations, an Oscar for Lifetime Achievement, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. As an author, he had written ten novels and memoirs. He was No. 17 on the American Film Institute’s list of the greatest male screen legends of classic Hollywood cinema, and the highest-ranked living person on the list. After barely surviving a helicopter crash in 1991 and then suffering a stroke in 1996, he had focused on renewing his spiritual and religious life. He lived with his second wife (of 63 years), Anne Buydens, a producer. He was to turn 101 on December 9, 2016.	1.0

Marquez ignored them which prompted calls and shouts that he was a racist.Marquez left the establishment after eating, but allegedly sustained a sudden blow to the back of his head outside the McDonald’s, which knocked him unconscious. When he woke up, his pants were ripped and wallet gone, which contained $400 in cash, three credit cards, his VA medical card, school identification, metro card and driver’s license.“I remember this group of teens harassing me while I was eating, they surrounded my table and kept on asking me ‘Do you believe black lives matter,'” Marquez told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “Then they started calling me a racist. I can’t recall if they were saying anything else to me at this moment because the blow to my head really screwed up my memory.”DeAnthony Mason, manager of the McDonald’s, reviewed security footage and told Marquez in a phone call Saturday that when he left the restaurant a teen with a white shirt struck him on the side of the head, knocking him unconscious. The other teens then converged on his incapacitated body, taking his belongings. The head blow Marquez sustained left his memory dazed, but Mason’s review of security footage helped him piece together what occurred.Upon regaining consciousness, Marquez found a cab driver willing to drive him to his apartment across from American University, where he attends school. Workers in the lobby called the police on his behalf, who took him to George Washington Hospital where he was evaluated for several hours. Medical documents obtained by TheDCNF show Marquez was treated for head trauma and an eye contusion.Credit card transactions reviewed by TheDCNF reveal that the assailants charged over $115 on his various credit cards at a liquor store, Five Guys and Walmart. Mason, the McDonald’s store manager told Marquez that police have been looking for the group of teens for a previous incident.“I believe this was a hate crime and I was targeted because of my skin color,” Marquez told TheDCNF. “Too many of these types of attacks have been happening against white people by members of the black community and the majority of the main stream media refuses to report on it.”Marquez served eight years active duty in the Marines between 2003 and 2011 in Iraq and Afghanistan as a Rifleman and Scout Sniper. He received the Bronze Star for valor during his first deployment after he carried the body of his slain team leader from combat following an ambush during the Battle of Fallujah.“When I was in the Marine Corps, I served with people from many different backgrounds, ethnicities, religions, and races,” Marquez told TheDCNF. “Like all Marines, I fought for the freedom of all Americans and not just one particular group.”Should Democrats Denounce This Black Lives Matter Activist?  	1.0

Until there is such research available, [the American Psychiatric Association] recommends that ethical practitioners refrain from attempts to change individuals’ sexual orientation, keeping in mind the medical dictum to first, do no harm.The potential risks of reparative therapy are great, including depression, anxiety and self-destructive behavior, since therapist alignment with societal prejudices against homosexuality may reinforce self-hatred already experienced by the patient. Many patients who have undergone reparative therapy relate that they were inaccurately told that homosexuals are lonely, unhappy individuals who never achieve acceptance or satisfaction. The possibility that the person might achieve happiness and satisfying interpersonal relationships as a gay man or lesbian is not presented, nor are alternative approaches to dealing with the effects of societal stigmatization discussed.Therefore, the American Psychiatric Association opposes any psychiatric treatment such as reparative or conversion therapy which is based upon the assumption that homosexuality per se is a mental disorder or based upon the a priori assumption that a patient should change his/her sexual homosexual orientation.”American Psychoanalytic Association, Position Statement on Attempts to Change Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity, or Gender Expression (2012), available at http://www.apsa.org/content/2012-position-statement-attempts-change-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-or-gender .“As with any societal prejudice, bias against individuals based on actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression negatively affects mental health, contributing to an enduring sense of stigma and pervasive self-criticism through the internalization of such prejudice.Psychoanalytic technique does not encompass purposeful attempts to ‘convert,’ “repair,” change or shift an individual’s sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.

https://www.snopes.com/pets-in-pet-food/	Does Pet Food Include Rendered Euthanized Pets?	unverified	['contaminated pet food', ' pets']	https://web.archive.org/	https://web.archive.org/web/19970430215442/http://www.belfield.com/article3.html	2017/05/08	"Volume 3Which commercial pet food do I recommend? That's the one question I am asked most frequently in my practice. My standard answer is ""none."" But let me clarify. There is no government agency setting quality standards and guidelines, so there are no assurances of quality in pet food. I am certain at some time you have noticed a change in your dog after feeding him or her different batches of the same brand of pet food. Your pet may have diarrhea, increased flatulence, a dull hair coat, intermittent vomiting, or may scratch more often. These are the most common symptoms I have observed over the years, and they are all associated with commercial pet foods. In 1981 while Martin Zucker and I wrote the first of my two books, How to Have a Healthier Dog, we discovered the full extent of the negative effects of commercial pet foods of that time. Much more recently, San Francisco Chronicle staff writer John Eckhouse went even further with a two-part exposé entitled ""Pet-Food Labels Baffle Consumers,"" and (a good candidate for a horror movie title) ""How Dogs and Cats Get Recycled Into Pet Food."" In the second article, published on February 19, 1990, Mr. Eckhouse, an investigative reporter, writes: ""Each year, millions of dead American dogs and cats are processed along with billions of pounds of other animal materials by companies known as renderers. The finished products -- tallow and meat meals -- serve as raw materials for thousands of items that include cosmetics and pet food."" There were the usual denials by pet food executives. Yet federal and state agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration and medical groups such as the American Veterinary Medical Association and the California Veterinary Medical Association, confirm that pets, on a routine basis, are rendered after they die in animal shelters or are disposed of by health authorities, and the end product frequently finds its way into pet food. Government health officials, scientists, and pet food executives say such open criticism of commercial pet food is unfounded. James Morris, a professor at the School of Veterinary Medicine at Davis, California, says, ""Any products not fit for human consumption are very well sterilized, so nothing can be transmitted to the animal. And to say products are unwholesome because we Americans don't like to eat them is incorrect. There's nothing wrong with eating spleen, which we don't do, but some Arabs [do]."" In my opinion, it is obvious that individuals who make such statements know nothing of the meat and rendering industries. Hold on to your hats -- I am going to take you on a bumpy ride through the meat-packing industry. For seven years I was a veterinary meat inspector for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the State of California -- in carrying out this office I had to wade through blood, water, pus, and fecal matter; inhale the fetid stench from the killing floor; and listen to the death cries of the animals being slaughtered. Prior to World War II, most slaughterhouses were all-inclusive; that is, the livestock was slaughtered and processed into fresh meat in one location. There was a section for smoking meats, a section for processing meats into sausages, and a section for rendering. During the years after World War II, the meat industry became more specialized. A slaughterhouse just slaughtered and dressed the carcasses; the making of sausages was done in a separate facility; and the rendering of slaughter waste also became a separate specialty -- and no longer within the jurisdiction of government meat inspectors. Now that the rendering companies are entities unto their own they can service many slaughterhouses, plus process any other animal remains that can be rendered. But first, to prevent the condemned meat from being rerouted and used for human consumption, government regulations require that the meat must be ""denatured"" before it is removed from the slaughterhouse. The denatured carcasses and other waste can then be transported to the rendering facility. In my time as a veterinary meat inspector, we denatured with carbolic acid (phenol, a potentially corrosive disinfectant) and/or creosote (used to preserve wood or as a disinfectant). Phenol is derived from the distillation of coal tar, creosote from the distillation of wood. Both substances are very toxic. Creosote was used for many years as a preservative for wood power poles. Its effect on the environment proved to be so negative that it is no longer used for that purpose. According to federal meat inspection regulations, fuel oil, kerosene, crude carbolic acid, and citronella (an insect repellent made from lemon grass) are the approved denaturing materials. The condemned livestock carcasses treated with these toxic chemicals can then become meat and bone meal for the pet food industry. Worse yet, since rendering facilities are not government-controlled, any animal carcasses can be rendered, including those of cats and dogs. Eckhouse quotes Eileen Layne of the California Veterinary Medical Association: ""When you read pet-food labels and it says meat or bone meal, that's what it is -- cooked and converted animals, including some dogs and cats."" Some of these dead pets -- those who were euthanized by veterinarians -- already have sodium pentobarbital in their bodies before being treated with the denaturing substances. In veterinary offices most cats and dogs are put to sleep with this chemical. According to Eckhouse, veterinarians at the University of Minnesota warned that the sodium pentobarbital used to put pets to sleep ""survived rendering without undergoing degradation,"" but they concluded that the residue amount would be too small to cause problems if the carcasses of euthanized pets were mixed with other raw materials during a day's production run. No mention was made of the cumulative effects on a cat or dog from ingesting this small amount daily for years. Thus far we have come across the denaturing chemicals and the sodium pentobarbital, and I have only just begun. In the finished rendered product, a fat stabilizer is introduced to prevent rancidity. The common chemicals used are BHA (butylated hydroxyanisole) and BHT (butylated hydroxytolulene), both known to cause liver and kidney dysfunction. Some European countries prohibit the use and importation of these preservatives. Another fat stabilizer often used is Ethoxyquin, suspected of being a cancer-causing agent. Propylene glycol, first cousin to ethylene glycol (antifreeze), is found in many semimoist dog foods. It causes the destruction of red blood cells. Lead also shows up frequently in pet foods, even if they are made from livestock meat and bone meal, simply as a result of our environment. A paper from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, titled ""Lead in Animal Foods,"" had two frightening conclusions. First, a 9-pound cat is ingesting more lead daily than what is considered potentially toxic for children. Second, since some commercially prepared pet and laboratory animal foods routinely contain lead, feeding these preparations to laboratory animals could add a significant, uncontrolled variable to experiments and may lead to uncertain experimental results (James G. Fox, et al., Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Vol. 1, 1976). You are providing a chemical feast to your pet when you feed it the meat and bone meal in pet foods. In the absence of any government inspection programs or any rules and regulations on standards and origins of the ingredients in these foods, my recommendation would be to feed your pets only food that you would eat, such as scraps from the table or from the butcher. Any veterinary nutritionist, government health official, or scientist who says feeding the aforementioned chemicals daily to our pets will not have a deleterious effect on them is living in a fool's paradise. Just look at the track record of government health officials and scientists over the years. Remember DDT? It took the life of a young boy before it was banned. Thalidomide? It was almost approved for use in America before it was found to cause severe deformities in unborn babies. The use of DES to fatten food-producing animals posed no threat to human life, said the health officials and scientists; but they were wrong. Even today, the government has given its approval to a feline leukemia vaccine which is not giving protection against the virus. In some instances, it is actually causing feline leukemia. I have been practicing small animal medicine for more than 30 years. Every day I have seen the casualties of the propaganda by the pet food industry. Yet the professors in the teaching institutions of veterinary medicine generally support an industry that has little regard for the quality of health in our companion animals. The question has never been whether or not pets are contracting diseases from pet food, but rather, what is the status of our pets' health when they are fed a steady diet of toxic chemicals? One last word of caution, not for pets this time but for their owners:  meat and bone meal from sources not fit for human consumption has found its way into poultry feed. This means that the animal products rendered under questionable conditions are being fed to birds that may wind up on your table. Remember this when you are eating your next piece of chicken or turkey. I have to add, however, that the bone meal sold as a calcium supplement is from carcasses graded for human consumption; it is not from condemned animals. This article was originally published in Let's Live magazine.Another website by Human Dimensions. I am certain at some time you have noticed a change in your dog after feeding him or her different batches of the same brand of pet food. Your pet may have diarrhea, increased flatulence, a dull hair coat, intermittent vomiting, or may scratch more often. These are the most common symptoms I have observed over the years, and they are all associated with commercial pet foods. In 1981 while Martin Zucker and I wrote the first of my two books, How to Have a Healthier Dog, we discovered the full extent of the negative effects of commercial pet foods of that time. Much more recently, San Francisco Chronicle staff writer John Eckhouse went even further with a two-part exposé entitled ""Pet-Food Labels Baffle Consumers,"" and (a good candidate for a horror movie title) ""How Dogs and Cats Get Recycled Into Pet Food."" In the second article, published on February 19, 1990, Mr. Eckhouse, an investigative reporter, writes: ""Each year, millions of dead American dogs and cats are processed along with billions of pounds of other animal materials by companies known as renderers. The finished products -- tallow and meat meals -- serve as raw materials for thousands of items that include cosmetics and pet food."" There were the usual denials by pet food executives. Yet federal and state agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration and medical groups such as the American Veterinary Medical Association and the California Veterinary Medical Association, confirm that pets, on a routine basis, are rendered after they die in animal shelters or are disposed of by health authorities, and the end product frequently finds its way into pet food. Government health officials, scientists, and pet food executives say such open criticism of commercial pet food is unfounded. James Morris, a professor at the School of Veterinary Medicine at Davis, California, says, ""Any products not fit for human consumption are very well sterilized, so nothing can be transmitted to the animal. And to say products are unwholesome because we Americans don't like to eat them is incorrect. There's nothing wrong with eating spleen, which we don't do, but some Arabs [do]."" In my opinion, it is obvious that individuals who make such statements know nothing of the meat and rendering industries. Hold on to your hats -- I am going to take you on a bumpy ride through the meat-packing industry. For seven years I was a veterinary meat inspector for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the State of California -- in carrying out this office I had to wade through blood, water, pus, and fecal matter; inhale the fetid stench from the killing floor; and listen to the death cries of the animals being slaughtered. Prior to World War II, most slaughterhouses were all-inclusive; that is, the livestock was slaughtered and processed into fresh meat in one location. There was a section for smoking meats, a section for processing meats into sausages, and a section for rendering. During the years after World War II, the meat industry became more specialized. A slaughterhouse just slaughtered and dressed the carcasses; the making of sausages was done in a separate facility; and the rendering of slaughter waste also became a separate specialty -- and no longer within the jurisdiction of government meat inspectors. Now that the rendering companies are entities unto their own they can service many slaughterhouses, plus process any other animal remains that can be rendered. But first, to prevent the condemned meat from being rerouted and used for human consumption, government regulations require that the meat must be ""denatured"" before it is removed from the slaughterhouse. The denatured carcasses and other waste can then be transported to the rendering facility. In my time as a veterinary meat inspector, we denatured with carbolic acid (phenol, a potentially corrosive disinfectant) and/or creosote (used to preserve wood or as a disinfectant). Phenol is derived from the distillation of coal tar, creosote from the distillation of wood. Both substances are very toxic. Creosote was used for many years as a preservative for wood power poles. Its effect on the environment proved to be so negative that it is no longer used for that purpose. According to federal meat inspection regulations, fuel oil, kerosene, crude carbolic acid, and citronella (an insect repellent made from lemon grass) are the approved denaturing materials. The condemned livestock carcasses treated with these toxic chemicals can then become meat and bone meal for the pet food industry. Worse yet, since rendering facilities are not government-controlled, any animal carcasses can be rendered, including those of cats and dogs. Eckhouse quotes Eileen Layne of the California Veterinary Medical Association: ""When you read pet-food labels and it says meat or bone meal, that's what it is -- cooked and converted animals, including some dogs and cats."" Some of these dead pets -- those who were euthanized by veterinarians -- already have sodium pentobarbital in their bodies before being treated with the denaturing substances. In veterinary offices most cats and dogs are put to sleep with this chemical. According to Eckhouse, veterinarians at the University of Minnesota warned that the sodium pentobarbital used to put pets to sleep ""survived rendering without undergoing degradation,"" but they concluded that the residue amount would be too small to cause problems if the carcasses of euthanized pets were mixed with other raw materials during a day's production run.

The novel—which was written as Adolf Hitler rose to power in Nazi Germany—tells the story of a fascist takeover in America.The main character, Buzz Windrip, appeals to voters with a mix of crass language and nativist ideology. Once elected, he solidifies his power by energizing his base against immigrants, people on welfare, and the liberal press. The novel has been called “frighteningly contemporary ” in the wake of the Trump campaign and election. As Slate wrote in September 2015:With his careful mix of plainspoken honesty and reactionary delusion, Trump is following an old rhetorical playbook, one defined and employed successfully in the 1936 presidential campaign of [Windrip].If you’d like to read the novel, you can still order it through Barnes & Noble , or by checking to see if your local brick-and-mortar bookstore has it in stock (or by going to the library!). You can also place an order for the novel on Amazon and the online retailer will ship it to you once it restocks its copies. 	1.0

DO YOU SUPPORT THIS ?Posted February 10, 2017 1:51pm UTC by adminLiberals got their eyes on our President since the very first moment he got in office. every step he made was followed with criticism. Liberals used immigrants to bash President Donald Trump. However, nothing goes the way they planned. The latest executive order signed by the President revealed many things, and we bet that liberals won’t like any of that. The latest order will put things in the right place, and illegals won’t be able to get away with everything they did so far.Sponsored by RevcontentxFormer president Barack Obama allowed illegals in America to apply and get on welfare. President Trump doesn’t approve this. You’d all agree that welfare is a privilege. It’s bad how some believe it’s the right that belongs to everyone who comes to this country. Illegals aren’t that fortunate. They will soon learn what’s like to live in a country ruled by Donald Trump. Every illegal who tries to collect a welfare check will feel justice on their back.President Trump signed an executive order according to which any illegal who lives on welfare will be sent home. And that’s not all. America will no longer accept people who come here to live on our expense. These people will no longer be able to enter the country.From Conservative Daily Post:“The administration would be seeking to “deny admission to any alien who is likely to become a public charge” and develop standards for “determining” whether an immigrant can be deported after five years, if that person receives a certain amount of public assistance, including Food Stamps, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and Medicaid.” It was about time that Americans take the matter in their own hands. President Trump will help us in achieving that. We’re finally seeing the light of the day. A beautiful future lies a head of us. The President is already draining the swamp. We’re getting rid of the bad stuff.What do you think about this executive order? Will it make the situation better?Recommended Stories:	1.0

Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), Ranking Member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, today sent a letter to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) requesting a review of President-elect Donald Trump's ""chaotic"" transition. The lawmakers asked GAO to examine conflicts of interest related to business holdings of Mr. Trump and his family, potential violations of protocol and national security concerns related to Mr. Trump's communications with foreign leaders, and transparency related to the use of taxpayer funds in the transition. Citing reports of ""disarray"" within a ""chaotic"" transition, Cummings and Warren raised concern about several aspects of the transition. They noted that despite Mr. Trump's claims that he will set up a ""blind trust"" to manage his business interests, ""To date, there has been no information released to the public indicating that Mr. Trump has prepared a blind trust.""  There have been several reports indicating that Mr. Trump or his family have not drawn a clear line between his Presidency and his company. ""At this point, it is not clear if the line between Mr. Trump's Presidency and his and business ventures is blurred-or entirely nonexistent,"" they wrote.Cummings and Warren also asked GAO to assess potential national security concerns associated with Trump's communications with foreign leaders, following reports that the President-elect has held conversations with foreign officials on his personal cell phone and has held diplomatic meetings with no State Department briefings. Noting that $9.5 million in federal funding has been allocated to the GSA to support the transition - in addition to other costs borne by taxpayers such as Secret Service protection - Warren and Cummings wrote, ""Mr. Trump's apparent conflicts of interest-and his behavior during the campaign and after his election-raise questions about the use of taxpayer funds during the transition, and about the decisions made during the transition that will affect federal government policies under the Trump Administration.""

In contrast, WalMart is up 3 percent since April, and Kohl’s is down less than one percent.Company officials indirectly acknowledged the consumer boycott. “Our fourth-quarter results reflect the impact of rapidly changing consumer behavior, which drove very strong digital growth but unexpected softness in our stores,” Target CEO Brian Cornell said in a company statement. The company also admitted that it would likely continue to experience losses through the year.Leaders at the American Family Association highlighted the company’s worsening situation. “The American Family Association has called for a boycott of Target since last April after the chain publicized the fact that it would allow men to use the women’s restrooms and fitting rooms in their stores,” said a statement from Tim Wildmon, president of the AFA. He continued:This [policy] is unacceptable for families, and the dangerous and misguided policy continues to put women and children in harm’s way. Men don’t belong in the same bathroom as our wives and daughters.Target shares are at the lowest level since 2014.The company’s earnings and stock prices have experienced a steady downward trajectory since its April 2016 decision to allow men and women to choose whatever bathroom or changing room they want to use at any given time in retail outlets across the nation. In the company’s April 19, 2016, statement , the store said, “we welcome transgender team members and [customer] guests to use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity.”A month later, even in the face of a developing stock crash, Target CEO Cornell insisted that the #BoycottTarget movement mounted after the company’s transgender bathroom decision had nothing to do with the fall in stock prices.The company’s stock price and earnings have never recovered since the 2016 announcement.

However, the latest iPhone 7 rumor makes me feel very annoyed. Via 9to5Mac, Japanese Apple blog Macotakara claims that Apple has plans to completely remove the 3.5-millimeter headphone jack from the device. This would mean that the only way to connect headphones to the device in the future would be either via Bluetooth or the Lightning port.DONT MISS: Black Friday rioting and fighting videos from around the webHeres why it wouldnt surprise me if this rumor had some truth to it: Apple showed starting with this years new MacBook that its on a quest to eliminate unnecessary ports. In fact, the new laptop featured just two ports: A USB Type-C port and a headphone jack. Apple is making a bet that all accessories are going to be wireless in the near future, which will eliminate the need to have so many ports on our devices.So I understand why it would do this but I find myself incredibly annoyed that its thinking of dumping the headphone jack all together just to make the iPhone 7 thinner.First of all, the iPhone doesnt need to be any thinner. Im actually very happy with the thickness of the iPhone 6s and was actually relieved to see that its slightly thicker and heavier than the iPhone 6 was. Second, I really dont want to have to buy a new set of headphones just to listen to music through my iPhone.(And I swear, if I have to buy a pair of Beats headphones to listen to music on my device, I will go back to Android. That is not an empty threat.)At any rate, this is still just a rumor but I dont think its a particularly outlandish one. Lets hope Apple decides to keep the 3.5-millimeter audio jack going forward and instead focus on improving the iPhone 7s battery capacity. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTags: Apple, iPhone 7 '	1.0

Hillary Only Won 57Politics By Eren Moreno December 1, 2016Are you growing tired of liberals crying over the so-called popular vote, as if Hillary Clinton is some beloved disenfranchised leader?There are rules to the contest, and Trump won fair and square. The rest is just noise and sore loser whining.If she wants, Hillary can go be the governor of California, or President of Saudi Arabia.Aside from her popularity in the ultra-liberal strongholds California and New York, the final election breakdown of the numbers shows what an ass-kickin’ Hillary received from the American people.From Allen West :The keening and caterwauling we’ve been treated to by the left since Hillary Clinton’s defeat has been monumental.Most entertaining has been the snowflake retreat to “safe spaces” with puppies and coloring books to assuage their anguish.Less entertaining were the violent protests whichwere paid foreruptedPutting aside Jill Stein’s quixotic effort to force a recount, the left has been loudest with its demands to dismantle the Electoral College.After all it’s unfair: Hillary Clinton won the “popular vote” so she should win, right?Wrong.Our Founders in their infinite wisdom created the Electoral College to ensure the STATES were fairly represented. Why should one or two densely populated areas speak for the whole of the nation?The following list of statistics has been making the rounds on the Internet and it should finally put an end to the argument as to why the Electoral College makes sense.Share this with as many whiners as you can.There are 3,141 counties in the United States.Trump won 3,084 of them.Clinton won 57.There are 62 counties in New York State.Trump won 46 of them.Clinton won 16.Clinton won the popular vote by approx. 1.5 million votes.In the 5 counties that encompass NYC, (Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Richmond & Queens) Clinton received well over 2 million more votes than Trump. (Clinton only won 4 of these counties; Trump won Richmond)Therefore these 5 counties alone, more than accounted for Clinton winning the popular vote of the entire country.These 5 counties comprise 319 square miles.The United States is comprised of 3, 797,000 square miles.When you have a country that encompasses almost 4 million square miles of territory, it would be ludicrous to even suggest that the vote of those who inhabit a mere 319 square miles should dictate the outcome of a national election.Large, densely populated Democrat cities (NYC, Chicago, LA, etc) don’t and shouldn’t speak for the rest of our country.Support the Trump Presidency and help us fight Liberal Media Bias.

When the CIA released findings that Russia had, in fact, interfered in the 2016 election, Trump was very quick to discredit the Central Intelligence Agency rather than question the integrity of the ruthless leader.The video, broken by the amazing Shawn King , is going viral fast.

(That kind of attribution may be possible with certain kinds of modeling studies; those studies have not yet been conducted.) These extreme weather events are very consistent with what climate change is expected to bring in the years ahead: global weirding. Extreme weather events become more extreme, and climate change is “‘loading the dice’ toward more extreme floods, heat waves, droughts, and hurricanes,” says Michael Mann , a climatologist and director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, in an email to The Verge. “We shouldn’t be surprised we’re turning up snake eyes so often now.”“This is going to be the future.”Mann’s not alone in thinking this summer has the shape of things to come. “This is going to be the future,” says David Titley , a meteorologist and director of the Center for Solutions to Weather and Climate Risk at Penn State. The future is going to have stronger heat waves, more wildfires, heavier rain storms, and a greater number of very intense hurricanes, Titley says. “At some point, our luck will run out.”It’s wrong to say that climate change caused this summer’s extreme weather events, scientists say. Hurricanes and fires have occurred in the past, after all. But “undoubtedly climate change is playing a role,” says Kevin Trenberth , a distinguished senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. These extreme weather events “are being exacerbated by the climate change element.”So here’s the role climate change might have played in this summer’s record-breaking heat waves, wildfires, and hurricanes.Heat wavesOver Labor Day weekend, California was broiled by a record-setting heat wave that killed six people. San Francisco reached 106 degrees Fahrenheit , the hottest it’s ever been since record keeping started about 150 years ago. (The previous record was 103 degrees Fahrenheit, set in 2000.) A few other cities broke heat records , as well. In June, Phoenix, Arizona, also hit a daily record , reaching 119 degrees Fahrenheit.Update: One additional all-time record high temp to report from recent heat event + 6 all-time record warm overnight lows. #CAwx #CAheatwave pic.twitter.com/Xdl63XZQUV— NWS Bay Area (@NWSBayArea) September 5, 2017Heat waves are the simplest weather event to attribute to climate change, says Adam Sobel , an atmospheric scientist at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and head of Columbia University’s Initiative on Extreme Weather and Climate. A variety of studies have shown that a warming climate increases the chances of heat waves and how severe those heat waves are going to be, Sobel says.The world’s average temperature has increased roughly by 1.53 degrees Fahrenheit from 1880 to 2012, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change . That may not seem like a lot, but if we don’t keep global warming well below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, we could see irreversible changes like melting polar ice caps, extensive flooding, bleached coral reefs, food shortages, and deadly diseases. As temperatures rise, there’s a greater chance of getting more intense heat waves and setting new heat records, says Sobel.WildfiresAll over the US, there are more than 110 large fires , burning through almost 2 million acres of land, including more than 80 wildfires in the western part of the country. These fires are making it hard to breathe all over the Pacific Northwest . “It’s very unusual to have this many fires burning this many acres across such a broad area at this time in September,” National Interagency Fire Center spokeswoman Jennifer Jones told Reuters . So far this year, we’ve had more than 48,000 fires , burning more than 8 million acres of land, 2 million acres over the national yearly average from 2007 to 2016.An image taken on September 4th by the NOAA-NASA's Suomi NPP satellite shows the direct path of the smoke from the West Coast fires that stretches across the entire countryPhoto: NASA image courtesy Jeff Schmaltz LANCE/EOSDIS MODIS Rapid Response Team, GSFCThere are several ingredients required for wildfires — some connected to climate change and some that have nothing to do with it. But dry conditions and extreme heat create good tinder, making wildfires worse in certain areas, says Benjamin Bond-Lamberty , an ecosystem ecologist with the Joint Global Change Research Institute. A warmer planet will cause more water to evaporate off the landscapes, drying trees and grasses — which then burn more easily. “That sets the stage for increased fire,” Bond-Lamberty says.Climate change can also make forests more prone to burning, since some pests can spread more readily in warmer temperatures, Bond-Lamberty says. The mountain pine beetle , for instance, is thriving because warmer winters don’t kill its larvae, allowing the beetles to spread and kill more trees, which serve as fuel. “That really sets up a lot of forest ready for things like a wildfire,” he says.Flames spread on a moonlit night at the La Tuna Fire on September 2nd near Burbank, California. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said at a news conference that officials believe the fire, which is at 5,000 acres and growing, is the largest fire ever in LA.Photo by David McNew/Getty ImagesOf course, climate change alone doesn’t cause wildfires — lightning or people are still required. A Forest Service policy of suppressing fires over much of the 20th century has also made our forests older, and more prone to burning. “We’re still paying the cost of that 20th century policy,” Bond-Lamberty says. “There’s a big accumulation of fuel built up on the landscape.”Still, climate change might already have an effect. A study last year found that in the West, climate change has doubled the area affected by forest fires over the last 30 years. Washington state had its biggest fire in state history in 2015, breaking its 2014 record, says Amy Snover , the director of the University of Washington’s Climate Impacts Group. The fire season has also lengthened, starting a month earlier in Alaska, she writes in an email to The Verge.HurricanesThis hurricane season has been incredibly active, with a number of severe storms. First, Hurricane Harvey barreled into Texas, dumping record rains and causing unprecedented  flooding in cities like Houston. Then, Hurricane Katia struck the east coast of Mexico, and Hurricane Irma — a Category 5 hurricane and one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the Atlantic — wreaked havoc on the Caribbean. ( Irma smashed a bunch of other records .) Another hurricane, called Jose , followed Irma, but now it seems the storm may remain out in the ocean .Floodwaters surround homes on September 7th in Richwood, Texas. Over a week after Hurricane Harvey hit Southern Texas, residents are beginning the long process of recovering from the storm.Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesThe intensity of these hurricanes seem to match what climate scientists are expecting in the future, says Titley. Research shows that strong hurricanes, like Harvey and Irma, will become more frequent as the planet warms, says Suzana Camargo, a professor of ocean and climate physics at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University.Climate change is expected to affect hurricanes in a few ways: warmer ocean waters will provide more energy to these storms, and more moisture in the atmosphere will increase the amount of rain these hurricanes can dump. Rising sea levels will also make storm surge from hurricanes worse, leading to higher floods.Whether climate change is already affecting hurricanes is up for debate, Sobel and Camargo say. It’s true that Harvey was fueled by warmer than usual waters in the Gulf of Mexico , but it was also particularly destructive because it stalled over Texas for a few days, dumping unprecedented amounts of rain. It’s still an open question whether climate change has anything to do with wind patterns, Titley says. And we don’t have enough data on hurricanes to understand whether stronger storms like Harvey and Irma are part of a larger trend, Sobel says.Boats, cars and other debris clog waterways in the Florida Keys two days after Hurricane Irma slammed into the state September 12th, 2017 in Marathon, Florida.Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images“The change might be there but it’s hard to prove it,” he says. “It’s like you’re listening to somebody talking quietly in a loud room. You may not be able to hear them but that doesn’t mean they’re not talking.”Whether we can attribute Harvey and Irma directly to climate change, however, kind of misses the point, Titley says. “People can see that these changes are coming and they are very consistent with what the vast majority of climate scientists have told us for decades is going to happen,” he says. “We shouldn't really be surprised.”Climate change is a known threat multiplier: this summer’s extreme weather events are just a taste of what’s about to come — and the sooner we address climate change, the better off we’ll be. That means lowering greenhouse gas emissions and building infrastructure that can survive sea level rise, for instance. “By and large, I think most of us don’t really like the change what we’ve seen,” Titley says, “and the climate system is kind of saying, ‘Hey guys, you ain’t seen nothing yet.’”Next Up In Science	1.0

Edsall By Thomas B. Edsall January 21, 2001Former president Bill Clinton and Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.), faced with multimillion-dollar houses to furnish here and in suburban New York, left the White House yesterday with an unprecedented $190,027 worth of gifts received over the last eight years.In their financial disclosure forms, the Clintons reported a variety of assets and receipts, including ""over $1 million"" in a Citibank personal account in New York; blind trusts, insurance policies and some common stock worth more than $1 million; and the payment of $1.05 million in legal fees by the Clinton Legal Expense Trust.Bill Clinton continues to owe ""between $1 million and $5 million"" to each of two law firms, Williams and Connolly and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, resulting primarily from his defense in House and Senate impeachment proceedings, along with a number of other investigations.Many of the gifts the Clintons are taking with them are from Hollywood figures, Democratic donors and a wide array of friends and associates, including his Georgetown University classmates.Most of the gifts are artworks, flatware, furniture, china and rugs for a couple who for nearly two decades have not had a home of their own but now suddenly have two large houses, one in Northwest Washington, the other in Chappaqua, N.Y.The Clintons received, for example, five gifts of china ranging in value from $2,110 from Jill and Ken Iscol, of Pound Ridge, N.Y. -- two of Sen. Clinton's new constituents -- to $5,000 from Mr. and Mrs. Bill Brandt of Winnetka, Ill.Actor-actress couple Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen of Los Angeles spent $4,787 for china, but they didn't quite match the $4,920 that movie director and producer Steven Spielberg and his wife, actress Kate Capshaw, paid for the china they gave the Clintons. Altogether, the Clintons reported receiving $21,819 worth of china.The Clintons will have no problem with silver and flatware for their guests in the future: They received five gifts of flatware worth a total of $17,966, including $4,944 worth of settings from Ghada Irani of Los Angeles and $4,967 worth from Edith Wasserman of Beverly Hills.One of the biggest gifts was from Steve Mittman of New York, who gave the Clintons two sofas, an easy chair and ottoman worth $19,900. That was more than double the value of the china cabinet, travel humidor, chandelier and copy of Abraham Lincoln's Cooper Union speech, together worth $9,683, from Mr. and Mrs. Walter Kaye, of New York.In addition, the Clintons left the White House with $52,021 worth of furniture, $71,650 in artworks and three carpets valued at $12,282.Bill Clinton's 1968 class at Georgetown University gave the former president and new senator a basket by artist Dale Chihuly said to be worth $38,000, and Chihuly gave the couple a $22,000 glass sculpture.In addition to the home furnishings, the most common gift given to the Clintons was golf equipment. Ten people gave drivers, putters and other golf paraphernalia worth $300 to $650. Actor Jack Nicholson gave Clinton a $350 driver.Actor Sylvester Stallone gave the couple boxing gloves.In seven previous years, the most the Clintons had reported receiving in gifts was $23,602 in 1999.Clinton's predecessor in the White House, George Bush, listed $52,853 in gifts in 1992.Researcher Madonna Lebling contributed to this report.politicsGet 2016 Olympics updates by emailOur best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox.post_newsletter333"	1.0
https://www.snopes.com/grape-juice-prevent-stomach-flu/	Grape Juice Prevents Stomach Flu?	unverified	['home cures']	http://musthavemom.com/	http://musthavemom.com/stomp-out-stomach-flu-with-grape-juice/	2017/01/04	This year has been an epically bad year for influenza and the stomach virus. Use this natural trick to prevent stomach flu, even if you’ve been exposed! We’ve been doing this for six years and it has kept us healthy, even when we know we’ve been exposed to the stomach virus. It’s so easy, you’d be a fool not to try it! The stomach flu (not truly the “flu”) by nickname, stomach bug, norovirus, puking flu as my kids like to call it…whatever you call it, it’s NOT FUN. Use this simple, effective trick to prevent the stomach flu! If you need home remedies stomach flu has already hit your house perhaps? This works for anyone who is exposed to the stomach virus, but is not yet showing symptoms. We do this daily in our house. Don’t wait any longer order what you need now! Before you waste any more time run over and order everything you need to prevent the stomach virus daily. This is the best home remedies stomach flu post you’ll find and here are the products you need at the best prices. Plus you’ll save yourself a trip to the store where you will likely pick up more germs! These are the best prices on the products you need plus they’ll ship right to your door. Don’t wait any longer on ordering these. Use them year-round or during peak stomach virus season, it’s up to you! There is a little-known home remedy to prevent the stomach bug altogether. The trick here is PREVENTION! If you are already feeling symptoms of the stomach flu then this will NOT work. You need to do this BEFORE you get sick. However, if you have been EXPOSED to the stomach bug but aren’t showing symptoms yet then this is the trick you need to prevent yourself from getting sick. The best part? It’s natural and doesn’t involve anything containing chemicals. I am all for natural remedies! Okay, this is going to sound a little “out there” but I’ve tried it and believe me this works! On Monday my hubby came down with the stomach flu. He was puking and felt awful. I think heÂ had norovirus which is a highly contagious stomach flu.Â Norovirus has been going around and sure enough, a guy he works with had it right before him.Â Well, of course, he had eaten off my plate that day and I was so worried that the kids and I would all get it too. A friend of mine told me to start drinking grape juice to prevent me from getting sick. The kids and IÂ all started drinking grape juice and here we are 3 days later healthy and well! You may have landed on my page after searching “prevent stomach flu grape juice”. Well, I did some research as there wasn’t much info out there on this. It turns out there is some science behind this grape juice thing and I did a little research. In order to prevent yourself from getting the stomach flu after you know you have been exposed (taking care of a sick person, being around someone that was sick, etc) you need to start drinking 100% Grape Juice, no sugar added, right away BEFORE any symptoms appear. If you are having symptoms then it is too late for thisÂ home remedies stomach fluÂ trick and DO NOT drink the grape juice or you will be puking purple and it won’t be pretty! Drink the grape juice three times a day for a few days after being exposed. I have been drinking a juiceÂ glass full three times a day and filling the kids sippy cups full three times a day. Yes, this is a lot of sugar but I’d rather consume/give my kids sugar than have them get the stomach flu. The grape juice works by changing the pH in your intestinal tract soÂ that the virus can’t multiply. It also harbors various strong anti-viral chemicals in it. Along with the Vitamin C and anti-oxidants in the juice, it’s supposed to flush and kill the virus and/or severely lesson the symptoms. When you get a stomach virus, it actually isn’t in your stomach, it’s all in your large and small intestines. The effects of what it’s doing to those makes you sick to your stomach (changing the acidity in your stomach). Keeping the pH of the intestines slightly more alkaline is supposed to stop the virus from taking hold and thus making you sick. You can drink the grape juice alone or add in grapefruit seed extract for additional virus-killing benefits.Â NutriBioticÂ® Maximum GSE Liquid Concentrate provides the highest available concentration of Citricidal brand grapefruit seed extract, a natural compound derived from the seed and pulp of grapefruit. The Citricidal seems to be the essential component in helping kill off any stomach virus in your system. I add 2-3 drops to the grape juice each time we drink it. Read the reviews on Amazon and see that this is also good for many, many other uses. It’s not only good for a home remedies stomach flu prevention trick, but so many other things too! So there is the science behindÂ this home remedies stomach flu prevention trick and I’mÂ the living experiment ğŸ™‚ We are all healthy and have survived having the stomach flu going through our house! I love that grape juice tastes great and is something my kids will willingly drink. So next time you are around someone with the stomach flu start drinking grape juice! During peak cold and flu season we drink one glass of grape juice a day to prevent the stomach flu. If you know you’ve been exposed to it then up it to three times a day until a few days after the virus is gone from your home. Otherwise, drink a glass daily to prevent the stomach bug from infecting you and your family! In the summer we don’t drink it as we find the stomach bug rarely strikes in summertime.	1.0

Does anyone have any idea how embarrassing that is?”“They’re refusing us entry to this country based on circumstances we have nothing to do with. It’s inhumane,” Donald Jr. piped up. “We have rights you know.”More:  How Donald Trump’s Sons Spent 24 Hours In VancouverThe decision to detain the pair has caused such controversy that even the President of the United States has personally tweeted about the incident. “Detaining people at an airport is disgusting. How the hell can the people of Vancouver look at themselves in the mirror after this,” he said, claiming the entire incident was all he needed to “finally justify invading Canada”.RCMP added that the cost of detaining the Trump bros. will be happily paid for by BC taxpayers.What do you think of the Trumps in Vancouver? Join the debate on Facebook  and Twitter , or support us by donating as little as $1 to our Patreon page !	1.0

He told Politico that his resignation was not in any way related to scandal. Not in any way shape or form. Ive been given more enemas by more people over the last eight years than you can possibly imagine. From the Secret Service to the Democratic Party. I am who I am. If they had something really scandalous, it wouldve come out a long, long time ago.Well, it would be true that it would have come out a long, long time ago had the FBI been investigating Russian money laundering by people involved in the American political process. But until Donald Trump came along, there werent really any major questions about such things in our political process. But we will get into that in a bit.The real scandal here is that somebody wanted to sleep with Jason ChaffetzAnother revelation is that Jason Chaffetz wants to spend more time with his family because he is allegedly having an affair.Latest from a well placed Congressional source is that @jasoninthehouse multi year affair with a woman was about to be revealed. https://t.co/Dg4hKCRtbZ Claude Taylor (@TrueFactsStated) April 20, 2017Just in case you arent familiar with Claude Taylor, he is a veteran of three presidential campaigns and was a White House staffer for the Clinton administration. He also served in the Obama administration. And this is just one piece of possible Russian kompromat on Jason Chaffetz.A 2nd source is claiming that the Russians knew about Chaffetz's affair and were blackmailing him. https://t.co/Dg4hKCzRNp Claude Taylor (@TrueFactsStated) April 20, 2017Chaffetz and Comeys leaked letterChaffetz is also the person responsible for leaking James Comeys letter to the public over the Clinton e-mail scandal. The press continually blamed Comey but the real culprit that used that information to interfere in the election was none other than Jason Chaffetz. This garnered Chaffetz a big fat ethics complaint from Scott Dworkin of the Democratic Coalition.According to a statement from Dworkin: Representative Chaffetz, in an ill-planned partisan attempt, released information that compromised the integrity of the FBI, when he irresponsibly tweeted out that the case investigating Secretary Clintons emails had been reopened, when in fact, it had not been. Members of Congress are elected to make our country a safer, better place  not to use their power to work with leaders such as Comey in a partisan fashion. I hope that both are held accountable for their actions.Some reports also allege that Chaffetz received a check from Trump for a whopping $10 million bucks for leaking the letter. Money that was likely obtained through nefarious means. Russian money laundering, anyone?Chaffetz and Russian Money LaunderingAnother scandal comes amid allegations that Chaffetz along with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell were working on ways to get Russian money into the American political process via dark super PACs that would hide the origin of the money received.According to an article from The Daily Kos:...The laundering of Russian money does make a great deal of sense. Why? Because just a few days ago there was a lot of chatter about an audio tape the FBI took into evidence. This pre-election tape purports to be a recording of Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell discussing how best to wash Russian money through House and senate campaigns via dark money superPACs. Paul Ryans name has already been linked with the Russian hacking of voter data from swing states so money laundering on behalf of the Russians is not a big leap from there and would be entirely in character for both men. Certainly both were desperate to hold onto the power they knew was slipping through their fingers so both would have grabbed at any opportunity for big money assistance without caring much where it came from.That would also explain Chaffetzs desires to gut the Office of Congressional Ethics. After all, with the complaints filed and a looming FBI investigation, that particular office could prove to be quite the thorn in the side of Republicans looking to cover up the crimes of the Trump campaign.According to a report from The Failing New York Times:House Republicans, overriding their top leaders, voted on Monday to significantly curtail the power of an independent ethics office set up in 2008 in the aftermath of corruption scandals that sent three members of Congress to jail.The move to effectively kill the Office of Congressional Ethics was not made public until late Monday, when Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, announced that the House Republican Conference had approved the change. There was no advance notice or debate on the measure.Of course, they failed to gut the OCE due to public outcry but Republicans may still win the day when a new budget passes.So actually, yeah Jason, youre resigning because of a massive scandal. Just not one massive scandal. Unless, of course, Chaffetz doesnt think Russian money laundering is a scandal. We look forward to seeing him do the perp walk with his cohorts in the House and Senate.

Domestic assets are moving into defensive positions. POSSIBLY RELATED MATERIAL (UPDATES CONTINUE BELOW FOLLOWING THIS RELATED MATERIAL)American and Russian fighter jets had a tense showdown in the skies above Syria as the Russians dropped bombs on U.S.-backed rebels.U.S. and Russian fighter jets bloodlessly tangled in the air over Syria on June 16 as the American pilots tried and failed to stop the Russians from bombing U.S.-backed rebels in southern Syria near the border with Jordan.The aerial close encounter underscores just how chaotic Syria’s skies have become as Russia and the U.S.-led coalition work at cross-purposes, each dropping bombs in support of separate factions in the five-year-old civil war.The near-clash also highlights the escalating risk of American and Russian forces actually coming to blows over Syria, potentially sparking a much wider conflict between the world’s leading nuclear powers.The incident began when at least two twin-engine Su-34 bombers, some of Moscow’s most advanced warplanes, struck what the Pentagon described as a “border garrison”  housing around 200 U.S.-supported rebels in At Tanf on the Syrian side of the Syria-Jordan border.The rebels had been “conducting counter-ISIL operations in the area,” the Pentagon stated on June 18, using an alternative acronym for ISIS.The United States and its allies in Syria clearly did not expect the air strike. The rebels in At Tanf are party to a shaky ceasefire agreement between rebel forces and the regime of Syrian president Bashar Al Assad—and, by extension, the Russian military contingent backing Al Assad. The Los Angeles Times reported that Russian planes had not previously been active over At Tanf. The Su-34s’ initial strike wounded, and perhaps killed, some of the rebels in At Tanf.The U.S. Navy scrambled F/A-18 fighters to intercept the Russians, the Los Angeles Times reported. The Navy has deployed two aircraft carriers to the region for strikes on ISIS. As the F/A-18s approached the Su-34s, officials with U.S. Central Command—which oversees America’s wars in the Middle East and Afghanistan—used a special hotline to contact their Russian counterparts directing Russia’s own intervention in Syria.Arriving over At Tanf, the American pilots apparently spoke directly to the Russian aviators. “Pilots CAN communicate with one another on a communications channel set up to avoid air accidents,” Central Command confirmed in a statement to The Daily Beast.Washington and Moscow had established the hotline as part of a so-called “Safety of Flight Memorandum of Understanding” that the two governments signed in October specifically in order to avoid the kind of aerial confrontation that occurred over Syria last week.With the American jets flying close enough to visually identify the Su-34s, the Russians departed the air space over At Tanf. Some time shortly thereafter, the F/A-18s ran low on fuel and left the area in order to link up with an aerial tanker. That’s when the Su-34s reportedly returned to At Tanf —and bombed the rebels again.According to the Los Angeles Times, the second strike killed first-responders assisting survivors of the first bombing run.The next day, senior U.S. Defense Department officials organized an “extraordinary” video conference with Russian counterparts to discuss the incident. The meeting included Acting Assistant Secretary for International Security Affairs Elissa Slotkin and U.S. Marine Corps Lt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, a strategic planner on the Pentagon’s joint staff, plus unspecified Russian Ministry of Defense officials.“Department officials expressed strong concerns about the attack on the coalition-supported counter-ISIL forces at the At Tanf garrison, which included forces that are participants in the cessation of hostilities in Syria, and emphasized that those concerns would be addressed through ongoing diplomatic discussions on the cessation of hostilities,” Defense Department spokesman Peter Cook explained in a statement.""Regarding safety, department officials conveyed that Russia’s continued strikes at At Tanf, even after U.S. attempts to inform Russian forces through proper channels of on-going coalition air support to the counter-ISIL forces, created safety concerns for U.S. and coalition forces,” Cook continued. “Department officials requested Russian responses to address those concerns.”Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov confirmed, via the country’s state-owned media, that the teleconference took place—but he did not specify the results of the “extraordinary” meeting.Russian warplanes had previously shadowed planes belonging to the U.S.-led coalition over Syria, but the coalition always described the Russians’ behavior as “professional.” By contrast, in April Russian Su-24 bombers repeatedly buzzed the U.S. Navy warship USS Donald Cook while the vessel sailed in international waters in the Black Sea. A Pentagon spokesman called the Russians’ actions in that incident “provocative and unprofessional.”The Kremlin should be keenly aware of the potential for unwanted—and potentially destabilizing—bloodshed that exists in the air over Syria. In November, a Russian Su-24 bomber flying a mission over Syria strayed over the Syria-Turkey border into Turkey—and a Turkish F-16 fighter promptly shot it down .The two Russian crew members ejected. One flier died when Syrian rebels on the ground opened fire on his parachute. Russian, Syrian and Iranian forces launched a complex rescue mission that ultimately retrieved the surviving pilot. One Russian marine died and a helicopter was destroyed during that operation.The fallout from the November incident continues, with Russia and Turkey exchanging threats—and Moscow imposing economic sanctions on Ankarra including limits on some food imports to Russia from Turkey.It’s not clear how close the U.S. fighters came to attacking and potentially shooting down the Su-34s over At Tanf. Central Command declined to say what the rules of engagement are for American pilots flying over Syria. “ROE are actually specifics that we don’t get into,” Central Command said in a statement.The last time a U.S. military warplane shot down a Russian—actually, Soviet—plane was in 1953, over Korea or China, depending on which historians you believe. The last time a Russian or Soviet warplane shot down an American aircraft was in 1970, when a U.S. Army plane strayed over Armenia.#### RESUMING UPDATES . . . .At 4:32 AM EDT -- A huge explosion has struck an ammunition depot at a military firing range in southern Russia.

After more than two decades following a “no testing on animals” policy, cosmetics giants Avon, Mary Kay, and Estee Lauder have resumed the practice without letting consumers know. In the late 1980s, PETA’s “Avon Killing” campaign eventually led to the company banning animal testing for their products, with Mary Kay and Estée Lauder following suit.According to a press release from Rush PR, the news was broken after animal rights organization PETA removed the companies from their cruelty-free list after discovering that they had returned to using testing on animals for their products. The three companies began the tests again in order to satisfy regulations from the Chinese government so they could sell their products in China. However, PETA contends that there are alternative testing methods that are just as effective and widely used in the US.Kathy Guillermo, the Vice President of PETA’s Laboratory Investigations was saddened by the move: “Avon, Estée Lauder, and Mary Kay have regressed a generation: Their products are once again being dripped into rabbits’ eyes and smeared onto animals’ abraded skin.” She’s urging customers to choose cruelty-free products instead.Avon spokeswoman Reese Witherspoon may be upset to learn about the new animal testing as well. Late last year she was “dismayed” to learn a bag she was spotted with was made from real python skin and agreed to throw it away. But perhaps she can use her star power to influence Avon to go back to their animal-friendly ways.Keep You Up To Date On All Our Doggie News!Join our mailing list to receive the latest news and updates from Dog Files.SUBMIT!Thank you so much for subscribing to Dog Files!Share:	1.0

It goes far and beyond organic versus nonorganic, gluten or hybridization because even conventional wheat triggers no symptoms for some who eat wheat in other parts of the world.What indeed is going on with wheat?For quite some time, I secretly harbored the notion that wheat in the United States must, in fact, be genetically modified.  GMO wheat secretly invading the North American food supply seemed the only thing that made sense and could account for the varied experiences I was hearing about.I reasoned that it couldn’t be the gluten or wheat hybridization. Gluten and wheat hybrids have been consumed for thousands of years. It just didn’t make sense that this could be the reason for so many people suddenly having problems with wheat and gluten in general in the past 5-10 years.Finally, the answer came over dinner a couple of months ago with a friend who was well versed in the wheat production process. I started researching the issue for myself, and was, quite frankly, horrified at what I discovered.The good news is that the reason wheat has become so toxic in the United States is not because it is secretly GMO as I had feared (thank goodness!).The bad news is that the problem lies with the manner in which wheat is grown and harvested by conventional wheat farmers.You’re going to want to sit down for this one.  I’ve had some folks burst into tears in horror when I passed along this information before.Common wheat harvest protocol in the United States is to drench the wheat fields with Roundup several days before the combine harvesters work through the fields as the practice allows for an earlier, easier and bigger harvest.Pre-harvest application of the herbicide Roundup or other herbicides containing the deadly active ingredient glyphosate to wheat and barley as a desiccant was suggested as early as 1980.  It has since become routine over the past 15 years and is used as a drying agent 7-10 days before harvest within the conventional farming community.According to Dr. Stephanie Seneff of MIT who has studied the issue in depth and who I recently saw present on the subject at a nutritional Conference in Indianapolis, desiccating non-organic wheat crops with glyphosate just before harvest came into vogue late in the 1990’s with the result that most of the non-organic wheat in the United States is now contaminated with it.  Seneff explains that when you expose wheat to a toxic chemical like glyphosate, it actually releases more seeds resulting in a slightly greater yield:   “It ‘goes to seed’ as it dies. At its last gasp, it releases the seed” says Dr. Seneff.According to the US Department of Agriculture, as of 2012, 99% of durum wheat, 97% of spring wheat, and 61% of winter wheat has been treated with herbicides. This is an increase from 88% for durum wheat, 91% for spring wheat and 47% for winter wheat since 1998.Here’s what wheat farmer Keith Lewis has to say about the practice:I have been a wheat farmer for 50 yrs and one wheat production practice that is very common is applying the herbicide Roundup (glyposate) just prior to harvest. Roundup is licensed for preharvest weed control. Monsanto, the manufacturer of Roundup claims that application to plants at over 30% kernel moisture result in roundup uptake by the plant into the kernels. Farmers like this practice because Roundup kills the wheat plant allowing an earlier harvest.A wheat field often ripens unevenly, thus applying Roundup preharvest evens up the greener parts of the field with the more mature. The result is on the less mature areas Roundup is translocated into the kernels and eventually harvested as such.This practice is not licensed. Farmers mistakenly call it “desiccation.” Consumers eating products made from wheat flour are undoubtedly consuming minute amounts of Roundup. An interesting aside, malt barley which is made into beer is not acceptable in the marketplace if it has been sprayed with preharvest Roundup. Lentils and peas are not accepted in the market place if it was sprayed with preharvest roundup….. but wheat is ok.. This farming practice greatly concerns me and it should further concern consumers of wheat products.Here’s what wheat farmer Seth Woodland of Woodland and Wheat in Idaho had to say about the practice of using herbicides for wheat dry down:That practice is bad . I have fellow farmers around me that do it and it is sad. Lucky for you not all of us farm that way. Being the farmer and also the president of a business, we are proud to say that we do not use round up on our wheat ever!This practice is not just widespread in the United States either. The Food Standards Agency in the United Kingdom reports that use of Roundup as a wheat desiccant results in glyphosate residues regularly showing up in bread samples. Other European countries are waking up to to the danger, however. In the Netherlands, use of Roundup is completely banned with France likely soon to follow.Using Roundup on wheat crops throughout the entire growing season and even as a desiccant just prior to harvest may save the farmer money and increase profits, but it is devastating to the health of the consumer who ultimately consumes the glyphosate residue laden wheat kernels.The chart below of skyrocketing applications of glyphosate to US wheat crops since 1990 and the incidence of celiac disease is from a December 2013 study published in the Journal Interdisciplinary Toxicology examining glyphosate pathways to autoimmune disease. Remember that wheat is not currently GMO or “Roundup Ready” meaning it is not resistant to its withering effects like GMO corn or GMO soy, so application of glyphosate to wheat would actually kill it.While the herbicide industry maintains that glyphosate is minimally toxic to humans,  research published in the Journal Entropy  strongly argues otherwise by shedding light on exactly how glyphosate disrupts mammalian physiology.Authored by Anthony Samsel and Stephanie Seneff of MIT, the paper investigates glyphosate’s inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, an overlooked component of lethal toxicity to mammals.The currently accepted view is that ghyphosate is not harmful to humans or any mammals.  This flawed view is so pervasive in the conventional farming community that Roundup salesmen have been known to foolishly drink it during presentations!However, just because Roundup doesn’t kill you immediately doesn’t make it nontoxic.  In fact, the active ingredient in Roundup lethally disrupts the all important shikimate pathway found in beneficial gut microbes which is responsible for synthesis of critical amino acids.Friendly gut bacteria, also called probiotics, play a critical role in human health. Gut bacteria aid digestion, prevent permeability of the gastointestinal tract (which discourages the development of autoimmune disease), synthesize vitamins and provide the foundation for robust immunity.  In essence:Roundup significantly disrupts the functioning of beneficial bacteria in the gut and contributes to permeability of the intestinal wall and consequent expression of autoimmune disease symptoms.In synergy with disruption of the biosynthesis of important amino acids via the shikimate pathway, glyphosate inhibits the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes produced by the gut microbiome.  CYP enzymes are critical to human biology because they detoxify the multitude of foreign chemical compounds, xenobiotics, that we are exposed to in our modern environment today.As a result, humans exposed to glyphosate through use of Roundup in their community or through ingestion of its residues on industrialized food products become even more vulnerable to the damaging effects of other chemicals and environmental toxins they encounter!What’s worse is that the negative impact of glyphosate exposure is slow and insidious over months and years as inflammation gradually gains a foothold in the cellular systems of the body.The consequences of this systemic inflammation are most of the diseases and conditions associated with the Western lifestyle:Gastrointestinal disorders	1.0

Several of the diplomats were recent arrivals at the embassy, which reopened in 2015 as part of former President Barack Obama's reestablishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba.Some of the diplomats' symptoms were so severe that they were forced to cancel their tours early and return to the United States, officials said. After months of investigation, U.S. officials concluded that the diplomats had been exposed to an advanced device that operated outside the range of audible sound and had been deployed either inside or outside their residences. It was not immediately clear if the device was a weapon used in a deliberate attack, or had some other purpose.The U.S. officials weren't authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the U.S. retaliated by expelling two Cuban diplomats from their embassy in Washington on May 23. She did not say how many U.S. diplomats were affected or confirm they had suffered hearing loss, saying only that they had ""a variety of physical symptoms.""The Cuban government said in a lengthy statement late Wednesday that ""Cuba has never permitted, nor will permit, that Cuban territory be used for any action against accredited diplomatic officials or their families, with no exception.""The statement from the Cuban Foreign Ministry said it had been informed of the incidents on Feb. 17 and had launched an ""exhaustive, high-priority, urgent investigation at the behest of the highest level of the Cuban government.""It said the decision to expel two Cuban diplomats was ""unjustified and baseless.""The ministry said it had created an expert committee to analyze the incidents and had reinforced security around the U.S. embassy and U.S. diplomatic residences.""Cuba is universally considered a safe destination for visitors and foreign diplomats, including U.S. citizens,"" the statement said.U.S. officials told The Associated Press that about five diplomats, several with spouses, had been affected and that no children had been involved. The FBI and Diplomatic Security Service are investigating.Cuba employs a state security apparatus that keeps many people under surveillance and U.S. diplomats are among the most closely monitored people on the island. Like virtually all foreign diplomats in Cuba, the victims of the incidents lived in housing owned and maintained by the Cuban government.However, officials familiar with the probe said investigators were looking into the possibilities that the incidents were carried out by a third country such as Russia, possibly operating without the knowledge of Cuba's formal chain of command.Nauert said investigators did not yet have a definitive explanation for the incidents but stressed they take them ""very seriously,"" as shown by the Cuban diplomats' expulsions.""We requested their departure as a reciprocal measure since some U.S. personnel's assignments in Havana had to be curtailed due to these incidents,"" she said. ""Under the Vienna Convention, Cuba has an obligation to take measures to protect diplomats.""U.S. diplomats in Cuba said they suffered occasional harassment for years after the restoration of limited ties with the communist government in the 1970s, harassment reciprocated by U.S. agents against Cuban diplomats in Washington. The use of sonic devices to intentionally harm diplomats would be unprecedented.___"	1.0
https://www.snopes.com/abortionist-strangled-baby-born-alive/	‘Abortionist’ Strangled Baby Born Alive	mixture	['abortion', ' abortion horror stories', ' lifesitenews', ' misleading', ' saline abortion']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/JWurm	2016/04/11	 catholic , pope francis , synod on the familyApril 8, 2016 ( Voice of the Family ) – The promulgation of the Apostolic Exhortation Amoris Laetitia by Pope Francis marks the conclusion of a synodal process that has been dominated by attempts to undermine Catholic teaching on matters relating to human life, marriage and the family, on questions including, but not limited to, the indissolubility of marriage, contraception, artificial methods of reproduction, homosexuality, “gender ideology” and the rights of parents and children. These attempts to distort Catholic teaching have weakened the Church’s witness to the truths of the natural and supernatural order and have threatened the well-being of the family, especially its weakest and most vulnerable members.The Apostolic Exhortation Amoris Laetitia is a very lengthy document, which discusses a wide variety of subjects related to the family. There are many passages that faithfully reflect Catholic teaching but this cannot, and does not, lessen the gravity of those passages which undermine the teaching and practice of the Catholic Church. Voice of the Family intends to present full analyses of the serious problems in the text over the coming days and weeks.Voice of the Family expresses the following initial concerns with the greatest reverence for the papal office and solely out of a sincere desire to assist the hierarchy in its proclamation of Catholic teaching on life, marriage and the family and to further the authentic good of the family and its most vulnerable members.We consider that in raising the following concerns we fulfil our duty as clearly laid out in the Code of Canon Law, which states:According to the knowledge, competence, and prestige which they possess, they have the right and even at times the duty to manifest to the sacred pastors their opinion on matters which pertain to the good of the Church and to make their opinion known to the rest of the Christian faithful, without prejudice to the integrity of faith and morals, with reverence toward their pastors, and attentive to common advantage and the dignity of persons. ( Canon 212 §3 )Admission of the “divorced and remarried” to Holy CommunionAmoris Laetitia, over the course of Chapter VIII (paragraphs 291-312), proposes a number of approaches that prepare the way for “divorced and remarried” Catholics to receive Holy Communion without true repentance and amendment of life. These paragraphs include:confused expositions of Catholic teaching on the nature and effects of mortal sin, on the imputability of sin, and on the nature of conscience;the use of ideological language in place of the Church’s traditional terminology;and the use of selective and misleading quotations from previous Church documents.A particularly troubling example of misquotation of previous teaching is found in paragraph 298 which quotes the statement of Pope John Paul II, made in Familiaris Consortio, that there exist situations “where, for serious reasons, such as the children’s upbringing, a man and woman cannot satisfy the obligation to separate.” However in Amoris Laetitia the second half of Pope John Paul II’s sentence, which states that such couples “take on themselves the duty to live in complete continence, that is, by abstinence from the acts proper to married couples” (Familiaris Consortio, No. 84),  is omitted.Furthermore, in the footnote to this misleading quotation, we read:In such situations, many people, knowing and accepting the possibility of living ‘as brothers and sisters’ which the Church offers them, point out that if certain expressions of intimacy are lacking, ‘it often happens that faithfulness is endangered and the good of the children suffers’ (Second Vatican Ecumenical Council, Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World Gaudium et Spes, 51).The document makes reference to this erroneous view but does not explain why it is a false approach, which is namely that: All sexual acts outside of a valid marriage are intrinsically evil and it is never justifiable to commit an intrinsically evil act, even in order to achieve a good end.“Faithfulness is endangered” by acts of sexual intimacy outside of marriage but faithfulness is lived when two individuals in an invalid union refrain from sexual intimacy in fidelity to their original union, which remains valid.The quotation implies that children will suffer because their parents, with the help of divine grace, live chastely. On the contrary, such parents are giving their children an example of fidelity, chastity and trust in the power of God’s grace.The document cites Gaudium et Spes but the passage is quoted out of context and does not support the argument made. The context makes clear that Gaudium et Spes is speaking of married Catholics, in the context of procreation, not those cohabiting in an invalid union. The full sentence is as follows:But where the intimacy of married life is broken off, its faithfulness can sometimes be imperilled and its quality of fruitfulness ruined, for then the upbringing of the children and the courage to accept new ones are both endangered (Gaudium et Spes, No. 51).It is therefore difficult to avoid the conclusion that the Apostolic Exhortation is at least raising the possibility that adulterous sexual acts might in some cases be justifiable and has misquoted Gaudium et Spes as if to provide grounds for this.Other approaches that undermine Catholic doctrine on reception of the sacraments will be discussed by Voice of the Family in due course.Parental rights and sex educationAmoris Laetitia includes a section entitled “The Need for Sex Education” (paragraphs 280-286). This section spans more than five pages without making even one reference to parents. On the other hand there is reference to “educational institutions”. Yet sex education is “a basic right and duty of parents” which “must always be carried out under their attentive guidance, whether at home or in educational centers chosen and controlled by them” (Pope John Paul II, Familiaris Consortio, No. 37). The omission of this teaching seriously fails parents at a time when parental rights regarding sex education are under serious and sustained attack in many nations of the world, and at the international institutions. In this section Amoris Laetitia does not cite any of the previous Church documents that clearly affirm this right; it does however cite a psychoanalyst, Erich Fromm, associated with the Frankfurt school. The document’s earlier references to parental rights (paragraph 84), while welcome, cannot compensate for the exclusion of parents from this section.Homosexual unionsAmoris Laetitia, following an approach similar to that previously adopted in synod documents, implies that “same-sex unions” may offer a “certain stability” and can have a kind of similarity or relation to marriage. It states that:We need to acknowledge the great variety of family situations that can offer a certain stability, but de facto or same-sex unions, for example, may not simply be equated with marriage. (Paragraph 53)There is great pressure at the international institutions for the rejection of the traditional understanding of the family through the adoption of language which refers to “variety” or “diversity” in the forms of the family. The implication that “same-sex unions” form part of the “great variety of family situations” is precisely what pro-family groups are fighting hard to oppose. By using such language the Apostolic Exhortation undermines the pro-family movement’s work to protect the true definition of the family and, consequently, to protect children who depend on the family structure willed by God for their well-being and healthy development.It should be noted that in paragraph 251 the authentic teaching of the Church, that “there are absolutely no grounds for considering homosexual unions to be in any way similar or even remotely analogous to God’s plan for marriage and family” is restated.“Gender ideology”Amoris Laetitia endorses a central aspect of “gender ideology” by asserting that it “needs to be emphasized” that biological sex and socio-cultural ‘gender’ can be “distinguished but not separated” (paragraph 56). This acceptance of the underlying principle of gender theory undermines the document’s otherwise welcome criticism of the ideology and its effects. The false notion that biological sex is distinguishable from so-called “gender” was first proposed in the 1950s and is the foundation of “gender ideology”. Opposition to the consequences of “gender ideology”will be impossible if its erroneous first principle is accepted.Attacks on innocent human lifeAmoris Laetitia fails to grapple with the scale of the threat to unborn children, the elderly and the disabled. Conservative estimates indicate that over one billion unborn lives have been destroyed by abortion over the last century. Yet in a document addressing challenges to the family, which is 264 pages long, there are only a small number of passing references to abortion. There is no mention of the destruction caused by artificial methods of reproduction, which have also resulted in the loss of millions of human lives. The absence of serious discussion of attacks on unborn life in this context is a grave omission.There is also minimal reference to euthanasia and assisted suicide despite the increasing pressure for their legalization across the world. Failure to adequately discuss this threat is likewise another very regrettable omission.ContraceptionAmoris Laetitia fails to adequately restate Catholic teaching on the use of contraception. This is a troubling oversight given that (i) the separation of the procreative and unitive ends of the sexual act is a major catalyst for the culture of death and that (ii) there is widespread disobedience and ignorance of the Church’s teaching in this area precisely because of the failure of the hierarchy to communicate this truth.  The document’s discussion of conscience is likewise flawed both in paragraph 222, which deals with “responsible parenthood”, and in Chapter VIII which deals with the admission to the sacraments of those in public adultery. Paragraph 303 is of particular concern, especially in the following assertion:Yet conscience can do more than recognize that a given situation does not correspond objectively to the overall demands of the Gospel. It can also recognize with sincerity and honesty what for now is the most generous response which can be given to God, and come to see with a certain moral security that it is what God himself is asking amid the concrete complexity of one’s limits, while yet not fully the objective ideal. In any event, let us recall that this discernment is dynamic; it must remain ever open to new stages of growth and to new decisions which can enable the ideal to be more fully realized.This statement seems to adopt a false understanding of the “law of gradualness” and suggest that there are certain occasions when sin is not only unavoidable but even actively willed by God for that person. This would clearly be unacceptable.ConclusionsThis is only a brief introduction to the very numerous problems found within Amoris Laetitia. It will take further study to fully draw out all the implications of the text but it is already abundantly clear that the document fails to give a clear and faithful exposition of Catholic doctrine and leads inescapably to conclusions that could result in violations of the immutable teaching of the Catholic Church, and those disciplines which are inextricably founded upon it. Our initial overview provides sufficient cause to regard this document as a threat to the integrity of the Catholic faith and the authentic good of the family.We reiterate once again that we make these criticisms with great reverence for the office of the papacy but with the consciousness of our duties as lay Catholics towards the good of the Church, and our duties as pro-life/pro-family campaigners to work to protect the family and its most vulnerable members.	1.0

It has recently come to the attention of the College that one of the recommended vaccines could possibly be associated with the very rare but serious condition of premature ovarian failure (POF), also known as premature menopause. There have been two case report series (3 cases each) published since 2013 in which post-menarcheal adolescent girls developed laboratory documented POF within weeks to several years of receiving Gardasil, a four-strain human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV4).1,2 Adverse events that occur after vaccines are frequently not caused by the vaccine and there has not been a noticeable rise in POF cases in the last 9 years since HPV4 vaccine has been widely used.Nevertheless there are legitimate concerns that should be addressed: (1) long-term ovarian function was not assessed in either the original rat safety studies3,4 or in the human vaccine trials, (2) most primary care physicians are probably unaware of a possible association between HPV4 and POF and may not consider reporting POF cases or prolonged amenorrhea (missing menstrual periods) to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), (3) potential mechanisms of action have been postulated based on autoimmune associations with the aluminum adjuvant used1 and previously documented ovarian toxicity in rats from another component, polysorbate 80,2 and (4) since licensure of Gardasil® in 2006, there have been about 213 VAERS reports (per the publicly available CDC WONDER VAERS database) involving amenorrhea, POF or premature menopause, 88% of which have been associated with Gardasil®.5 The two-strain HPV2, CervarixTM, was licensed late in 2009 and accounts for 4.7 % of VAERS amenorrhea reports since 2006, and 8.5% of those reports from February 2010 through May 2015. This compares to the pre-HPV vaccine period from 1990 to 2006 during which no cases of POF or premature menopause and 32 cases of amenorrhea were reported to VAERS.Many adolescent females are vaccinated with influenza, meningococcal, and tetanus vaccines without getting Gardasil®, and yet only 5.6% of reports related to ovarian dysfunction since 2006 are associated with such vaccines in the absence of simultaneous Gardasil® administration. The overwhelming majority (76%) of VAERS reports since 2006 with ovarian failure, premature menopause, and/or amenorrhea are associated solely with Gardasil®. When VAERS reports since 2006 are restricted to cases in which amenorrhea occurred for at least 4 months and is not associated with other known causes like polycystic ovary syndrome or pregnancy, 86/89 cases are associated with Gardasil®, 3/89 with CervarixTM, and 0/89 with other vaccines administered independently of an HPV vaccine.5 Using the same criteria, there are only 7 reports of amenorrhea from 1990 through 2005 and no more than 2 of those associated with any one vaccine type.Few other vaccines besides Gardasil® that are administered in adolescence contain polysorbate 80.6 Pre-licensure safety trials for Gardasil® used placebo that contained polysorbate 80 as well as aluminum adjuvant.2,7 Therefore, if such ingredients could cause ovarian dysfunction, an increase in amenorrhea probably would not have been detected in the placebo controlled trials. Furthermore, a large number of girls in the original trials were taking hormonal contraceptives which can mask ovarian dysfunction including amenorrhea and ovarian failure.2 Thus a causal relationship between human papillomavirus vaccines (if not Gardasil® specifically) and ovarian dysfunction cannot be ruled out at this time.Numerous Gardasil safety studies, including one released recently,8 have looked at demyelinating and autoimmune diseases and have not found any significant problems. Unfortunately, none of them except clinical safety pre-licensure studies totaling 11,778 vaccinees9 specifically addressed post-vaccination ovarian dysfunction. While data from those studies do not indicate an increased rate of amenorrhea after vaccination, the essential lack of saline placebos and the majority of participants taking hormonal contraceptives in those studies preclude meaningful data to rule out an effect on ovarian function.A Vaccine Safety Datalink POF study is planned to address an association between these vaccines and POF, but it may be years before results will be determined. Plus, POF within a few years of vaccination could be the tip of the iceberg since ovarian dysfunction manifested by months of amenorrhea may later progress to POF. Meanwhile, the author of this statement has contacted the maker of Gardasil, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to make known the above concerns and request that (1) more rat studies be done to look at long-term ovarian function after HPV4 injections, (2) the 89 VAERS reports identified with at least 4 months amenorrhea be reviewed by the CDC for further clarification since the publicly available WONDER VAERS database only contains initial reports, and (3) primary care providers be notified of a possible association between HPV and amenorrhea. A U.S. Government Representative responded that they “will continue to conduct studies and monitor the safety of HPV vaccines. Should the weight of the evidence from VAERS or VSD and other sources indicate a likely causal association between POF and HPV vaccines, appropriate action will be taken in terms of communication and public health response.”The College is posting this statement so that individuals considering the use of human papillomavirus vaccines could be made aware of these concerns pending further action by the regulatory agencies and manufacturers. While there is no strong evidence of a causal relationship between HPV4 and ovarian dysfunction, this information should be public knowledge for physicians and patients considering these vaccines.Primary author: Scott S.

https://www.snopes.com/texas-harvey-israel/	Did a City in Texas Require Harvey Aid Recipients to Promise Not to Boycott Israel?	true	['harvey', ' hurricane harvey', ' israel', ' israel boycott', ' texas']	https://www.texasmonthly.com/	https://www.texasmonthly.com/the-daily-post/dickinson-harvey-israel/	2017/10/24	8 CommentsQUOTE OF THE DAY“We understand your desire to attend our games as an escape and chosen form of entertainment. In that, we feel there is significant commonality in all of us that allows our community to be so special. That commonality should include aspirations for social justice, freedom of speech in its many forms, and equal opportunity for education and economic advancement regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation or religion.”—Manu Ginobili, in a tweet on Thursday, according to the San Antonio Express-News . Before Wednesday’s game, Spurs players—along with retired legends Tim Duncan and David Robinson—locked arms as the above message was displayed on screens inside the AT&T Center.BIG NEWSChris Gaspard helps remove ruined items from his friend Bryan Parson’s home brought on by flooding in the wake of Hurricane Harvey in Dickinson, Texas.Photo by Win McNamee/Getty ImagesBad DealThe city of Dickinson, in Galveston County, was among the hardest-hit places when Hurricane Harvey’s torrential rains slammed Texas . Residents now seeking Harvey relief face a strange ultimatum: agree not to boycott Israel, or your application for aid will be denied. According to the Houston Chronicle , the city’s hurricane repair grant application , which allows residents to apply for funds to help rebuild a home or business impacted by Hurricane Harvey, includes a surprising stipulation. “By executing this Agreement below, the Applicant verifies that the Applicant: (1) does not boycott Israel; and (2) will not boycott Israel during the term of this Agreement,” it states. The application has gotten the attention of the American Civil Liberties Union, which called the prohibition unconstitutional on Thursday. “The First Amendment protects Americans’ right to boycott, and the government cannot condition hurricane relief or any other public benefit on a commitment to refrain from protected political expression,” Andre Segura, the legal director of the ACLU of Texas, told the Chronicle. “Dickinson’s requirement is an egregious violation of the First Amendment, reminiscent of McCarthy-era loyalty oaths requiring Americans to disavow membership in the Communist party and other forms of ‘subversive’ activity.”MEANWHILE, IN TEXASReal TalkFormer President George W. Bush delivered a harshly worded speech on Thursday. He condemned the divisive actions of President Donald Trump , though he stopped short of actually calling out the president by name. “We’ve seen our discourse degraded by casual cruelty,” Bush said during a sixteen-minute address at “The Spirit of Liberty” event in New York, sponsored by his presidential center. “Bullying and prejudice in our public life sets a national tone and provides permission for cruelty and bigotry. The only way to pass along civic values is to first live up to them.” Bush said our political system has been corrupted by “conspiracy theories and outright fabrication,” and cautioned against the U.S. turning inward under Trump. “We’ve seen nationalism distorted into nativism, forgotten the dynamism that immigration has always brought to America,” Bush said. “We see a fading confidence in the value of free markets and international trade, forgetting that conflict, instability and poverty follow in the wake of protectionism. We’ve seen the return of isolationist sentiments, forgetting that American security is directly threatened by the chaos and despair of distant places.” He took aim at white supremacy too. “Our identity as a nation—unlike many other nations—is not determined by geography or ethnicity, by soil or blood,” Bush said. “This means that people of every race, religion, and ethnicity can be fully and equally American. It means that bigotry or white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the American creed.”On the BrinkThe Houston Astros face a must-win situation Friday night in game six of the American League Championship Series against the New York Yankees. If they win, they live another day, forcing a series-deciding game seven in Houston on Saturday. If they lose, their season is done. As ESPN notes, this is an unusual spot for the ‘Stros to be in. They’ve held onto first place in the American League West for 178 of 183 days during the regular season, every day since April 12, and they held a lead at the end of 25 of 36 innings in the previous round of the playoffs. Even in the ALCS, they were leading or tied through the series’s first nineteen innings, jumping out to a 2-0 series lead. On Friday, the team will turn to starting pitcher Justin Verlander, who dominated the Yankees in the second game of the series, striking out thirteen batters while allowing one run over nine spectacular innings. They’ll also have the support of their home crowd. “Our backs are against the wall,” catcher Brian McCann told ESPN. “We’ll be ready. This team, we’ve played extremely well all season long, and nothing’s going to change. We’ll be ready for game six. We’ve responded all year long.”Fast Food BeefWhataburger is typically considered the undisputed champ of the fast food scene here in Texas, but according to a new ranking by Business Insider , Texans actually prefer California-based chain In-N-Out. Yes, we know, this is truly a travesty. Business Insider’s methodology here is hardly scientific, as it relies solely the publication data from Foursquare, a social media app which lets users “check in” at certain locations, to determine which fast food restaurant was most popular in each state. “For the study, we looked at which chains received the most visits on average in every state based on the total number of visits to each chain divided by the number of locations in that state,” Business Insider wrote. Somehow, that research showed In-N-Out as the top choice among Texans. As the Houston Chronicle notes, In-N-Out only has 35 restaurants in Texas, while Whataburger has nearly 200 locations in the Houston area alone. We think Whataburger still has a leg up on In-N-Out, regardless of what Business Insider says.WHAT WE’RE READINGSome links are paywalled or subscription-only.Laura Bush will appear as a guest in the final season of Fixer Upper  Dallas Morning NewsAustin’s Richard Overton, the oldest living World War II veteran in the U.S., has new digs Austin American-StatesmanA Killeen ISD teacher duct-taped the mouths of ten fifth-graders Killeen Daily HeraldAmazon just opened a giant wind farm in Scurry County CNBCThe death of a pet dog gave a Texan woman “broken-heart syndrome” Washington PostGet Texas Monthly.

It’s why he calls his lab manager, Wade Sanders, “Walter,” after the show’s protagonist, Walter White.And like the famously pure and powerful blue meth White cooked up on Breaking Bad, the product produced by 710 Labs’ fancy equipment is extremely concentrated, powerful, and coveted: butane-extracted hash oil (BHO). The lab’s finished BHO might not look like much—a thin, hard, and shiny brown slab, like peanut brittle without the peanuts—but when a piece of this “shatter,” as it’s called, is placed on the nail of a specially designed pipe that’s been superheated by a blowtorch, it vaporizes and delivers a direct hit of 70 to 90 percent THC, three times the potency of the strongest marijuana strains. As Melshenker puts it, if smoking regular pot is like drinking a beer, “dabbing,” as this process is known, is a shot of hard liquor. Vice calls the result , “The smoothest slow-motion smack in the face of clean, serene stonedness that you’ve ever experienced.” Rolling Stone reports , “Your head spins, your eyes get fluttery, a few beads of sweat surface on your forehead and, suddenly, you're cosmically baked.” Some pot aficionados vow to never smoke the old way again.Gucci Earwax, a butane extraction, made by Mahatma Extreme Concentrates for Karmaceuticals in Denver. It won the first-place medical concentrate trophy at the High Times 2013 Denver U.S. Cannabis Cup.Courtesy of Ry Prichard/CannabisEncyclopedia.comHash, in other words, is no longer just a way to make use of leftover marijuana trim. It’s now becoming the main attraction. (Butane isn’t the only way to extract hash oil from marijuana, either; some concentrate-makers use carbon dioxide– or water-based extraction methods.) At Greenest Green , Melshenker’s Boulder dispensary, the inventory used to be 60 percent marijuana flower, 30 percent BHO, and 10 percent edibles. Now it’s the opposite: 60 percent BHO, 30 percent flower, and 10 percent edibles. And roughly 40 dispensaries statewide contract with 710 Labs to turn their marijuana into shatter or “budder,” a gloopier version. (Because of delays in Boulder’s regulation process, 710 Labs won’t be able to produce recreational BHO until Feb. 17.)AdvertisementHash oil is even fueling its own subculture. Forget 4:20; “dab heads” or “oil kids” light up at 7:10. (Turn the digits upside down and you have “OIL.”) Connoisseurs sport specially designed blowtorches and incredibly pricey “oil rig” pipes; a top-of-the-line rig from Melshenker’s Faulty Pelican glass company sets you back $14,000. There’s even dab gear, made by companies like Grassroots .“There’s a whole industry here,” says Melshenker, whose business card doubles as a stainless-steel dabber, the tool used to apply BHO to an oil rig’s superheated nail.A production process laden with volatile chemicals; a highly concentrated, easily transportable final product; incredibly stoned kids with blowtorches …Colorado’s thriving dabbing scene could just be one more bit of proof that the state is becoming a global mecca for marijuana. After all, the state’s legalized marijuana experiment has so far been an unqualified success. Despite the surprisingly limited number of recreational pot shops that opened their doors on Jan. 1—and the hefty crowds waiting in line to patronize them—the state hasn’t experienced widespread product shortages or weed prices high enough to trigger an Uber-style backlash . Yes, there was that story about 37 deadly marijuana overdoses on the first day of sales , but it turned out to be an obvious hoax. The few pundits who’ve complained about Colorado’s legalized pot, like David Brooks and Nancy Grace, have found their arguments blasted full of holes , not to mention lambasted on Saturday Night Live . The Justice Department is looking into ways to help banks play nice with marijuana businesses — a very serious problem —and even President Obama in a recent New Yorker profile conceded it’s important for the experiment to go forward .Soon enough, then, Colorado’s small-scale experiment should spread far and wide, with controversial drug laws getting the boot, millions of clandestine tokers coming out of the closet, and governments reaping the benefits in taxes and fees. That is unless something goes terribly wrong, derailing the whole legalization movement.AdvertisementSuch a gloomy outcome isn’t out of the question. The only reason that Colorado is enjoying fame as the first place to legalize pot is thanks to a combination of fortunate timing, plucky advocates, forward-thinking lawmakers, and a remarkable lack of snafus. Colorado’s 2012 legalization attempt very well could have floundered if the effort hadn’t enjoyed remarkably positive media coverage. Considering the precipitous rise of the state’s medical marijuana industry and lawmakers’ keen efforts to moderate it, all it could have taken was the right bad headline—a high-profile crime or a boneheaded political move—to set the endeavor back considerably. Recall that alcohol prohibition was built on the temperance movement’s carefully crafted tales of woe and violence. As Salvation Army Commander Evangeline Booth once put it :Drink has drained more blood …Dishonored more womanhood,Blasted more lives,Driven more to suicide, andDug more graves than any other poisoned scourge that ever swept its death-dealing waves across the world.Mixed shatter slab by TC Labs. The product is broken prior to packaging to fit into the 1 gram or less packaging requirements.Courtesy of Ry Prichard/CannabisEncyclopedia.comIn Colorado, however, there have been very few sordid marijuana tales that could be used to demonize the drug—so far. Weed-fueled horror stories could still emerge in the state—and with the world watching, such calamities could have an international impact. So what are the biggest potential risks? A major concern is diversion, taking Colorado’s legal pot and offloading it to the black market or selling it out of state. While Colorado has established an extensive tracking system to prevent this from happening, there will always be tourists trying to take home a pot-infused souvenir. Beyond diversion, there’s the menace of crime—not just the threat of burglaries and organized crime in a largely cash-based industry, but also the distant possibility of banks or other financial institutions getting slapped with federal money laundering charges if they accept any of that free-flowing marijuana cash. Finally, there’s the prospective collateral damage, such as kids accidentally eating pot brownies— something that’s already in the news —or a violent pot-related car crash.If any of these calamities do occur, Colorado’s red-hot dabbing scene could in fact be the source of the problem. Dabbing certainly appears on the surface to be dangerous: Kids are freebasing marijuana! It looks like they’re smoking crack! But it’s important to remember that there’s no evidence that it’s possible to overdose on pot. (Compared to say, acetaminophen, overdoses of which killed more than 1,500 Americans during the past decade.) So you can smoke the strongest dab imaginable—or even, if you’re a showboat, smoke 50 dabs in a row —and science says it won’t kill you. It will just get you really, really high.Mars OG ISO dab, an isopropyl alcohol extraction made by Pink House Labs in Denver.Courtesy of Ry Prichard/CannabisEncyclopedia.comAdvertisementBut just because something won’t poison you the way alcohol can doesn’t mean it can’t lead you to do something stupid enough that will kill you. And there seem to be enough disconcerting variables associated with dabbing culture—a production process laden with volatile chemicals; a highly concentrated, easily transportable final product; and incredibly stoned kids with blowtorches—it seems only a matter of time until somebody in the scene does something very stupid and possibly fatal.Yes, dabbing might not be as inherently dangerous as, say, a bar full of binge-drinkers. But it’s important to remember that recreational marijuana isn’t necessarily replacing alcohol use—it’s just adding a new legal vice to the options people already have. While some researchers predict legalized marijuana will decrease alcohol use , others predict it could lead to “heavy drinking” and “carnage on our highways.” So will folks really reach for a dabbing pipe instead of a shot glass—or will they reach for both?Top CommentNobody tell these fellows about vaporizers. They're going to worry about them detonating the atmosphere, or causing glaciers to melt, or something.   More...-J P McMahonJoin InQuestions like this have led California and Washington to outlaw the production of smokeable marijuana concentrates. Colorado, however, has gone the opposite route: In November it released a draft of proposed concentrate production rules , positioning itself to become the only place in the world where marijuana concentrate production is both legal and regulated. The idea is to police the blooming subculture, to stay on top of it, so it ends up more akin to tattooing than meth. “If we outlaw concentrates, people will make them in their basements and blow themselves up,” says Norton Arbelaez, co-owner of the Denver dispensary RiverRock Wellness , which operates a concentrate production facility. But just because a concentrate extraction system is certified by a third-party industrial hygienist, as will likely be required by Colorado’s concentrate rules, doesn’t mean that system can’t still accidentally blow up.It makes sense that Colorado is at the vanguard of legalized dabbing. It’s made a habit of taking risks when it comes to marijuana. Colorado can’t regulate away the chance that dabbing or some other marijuana-related endeavor will lead to a spectacular accident, either industrial or personal. But so far its legalization effort has taken pains to thoughtfully minimize such risks—and so far, it’s working.	1.0

Snape said in an interview today.AdvertisementHoping to find answers, Snape filed a request under the federal Freedom of Information Act, asking the National Park Service to provide records regarding the sale of wine and other alcoholic beverages at Shenandoah and other national parks.The request also asks NPS to produce any records or documents that mention Trump, his family members or Trump merchandise.Snape said the discovery of the wine at Shenandoah was first made by one of the center's members, who took photos of the bottles but wants to remain anonymous.""She just stumbled across it and obviously got a little fired up and upset. I checked it out and confirmed it,"" Snape said.Snape added that the issue raises more questions on the extent to which Trump's role as commander in chief collides with his role ""as chief of the Trump empire ... with no understanding of where it begins and where it ends.""""If this is the level of Trumpism at national parks, what other policy issues have that level of Trumpism?"" Snape said. ""It just raises a number of disturbing and intriguing conflict-of-interest issues.""Jeremy Barnum, spokesman for the National Park Service, said the wine is not being sold by Shenandoah National Park, but rather by Delaware North Cos. Inc., the park's licensed concessioner.""The National Park Service authorizes concessioners to sell categories of retail goods and products like t-shirts, baseball hats, and in this case wine. However, the NPS does not specify what brands of these products should be sold,"" Barnum said. ""The concessioner has been selling wine from the distributor of this particular winery in Virginia for years."""	1.0

She'll then lie waiting for her cubs to be born as winter sets in.""Image caption Sir David travelled to both polar regions with the film crewLater, the film cuts to a mountainside: ""On lee-side slopes beneath the snow, new lives are beginning,"" Sir David narrates.Footage of the newborn cubs filmed at the animal park is then screened.The den was actually created by humans before the polar bear entered.The BBC said the narration ""talked in general about polar bears in the wild rather than the specific cubs shown"".In the online clip, posted on 7 November  - before the episode in question was broadcast - producer Kathryn Jeffs explains: ""The problem for us is that they (the polar bears) do it (give birth) underneath the snow in these dens of ice, and there's absolutely no way that we could get our cameras down there.""It would be completely impractical and you wouldn't want to disturb the polar bears by getting that close,"" she added.The BBC programme features 10-minute segments at the end of each episode explaining how film crews got up close to the wildlife, but the polar bear cub footage was not included here.Media regulator Ofcom said they have received ""fewer than a handful"" of complaints about Frozen Planet.The organisation will now decide whether they will investigate further or it is a matter for the BBC Trust."	1.0
https://www.snopes.com/hillary-bill-clinton-russia-sanctions-speech/	Did Hillary Clinton Side With Kremlin on Sanctions Due to a $500,000 Payment to Bill?	unverified	['dnc hack', ' donald trump', ' fox news', ' hillary clinton', ' magnitsky act', ' russia investigation', ' sanctions', ' sergei magnitsky', ' wikileaks']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/hRd2u	2017/07/20	Now PlayingEmails show Bill Clinton paid thousands for speech in RussiaThe Russian lawyer who landed a meeting with Donald Trump Jr. during last year’s presidential campaign with the promise of dirt on Hillary Clinton had one big thing in common with the Democratic candidate: Both had opposed Russia sanctions targeting human-rights abusers. Further, former Secretary of State Clinton’s initial opposition coincided with a $500,000 speech her husband gave in Moscow – a link her 2016 campaign fought to downplay in the press, according to WikiLeaks-released documents.Trump White House officials now are trying to draw attention to that speech and the Clintons’ ties to Russia in a bid to counter criticism over Trump Jr.’s now-infamous meeting. “If you want to talk about having relationships with Russia, I'd look no further than the Clintons,” Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at a briefing last week. “Bill Clinton was paid half a million dollars to give a speech to a Russian bank, personally thanked by President Putin.”“With the help of the research team, we killed a Bloomberg story trying to link HRC’s opposition to the Magnitsky bill a $500,000 speech that WJC gave in Moscow.”- May, 2015 email from Clinton campaign stafferThe former president indeed had received a personal call from then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin expressing his appreciation for the speech. According to Mrs. Clinton’s ethics disclosure form filed while she was secretary of State, Bill Clinton was paid $500,000 by the Russia-based finance company Renaissance Capital for his June 29, 2010, speech in Moscow to its employees and guests attending the company's annual conference. The speech is now coming back to haunt the Clintons, considering the company that cut the check was allegedly tied to the scandal that spurred the Global Magnitsky Act, a bill that imposed sanctions on Russians designated as human-rights abusers and eventually would become law in 2012.Related ImageExpand / CollapseFormer President Bill Clinton with his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton  (AP)This was the same law Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya was lobbying against during her sit-down with Trump Jr. last year. And back in 2010, it would have put the Clintons on her side. Shortly before Bill Clinton’s speech in 2010, when members of Congress pushing the sanctions bill had asked Hillary Clinton to refuse visas to Russian officials implicated under the policy, the State Department denied the request. The Obama administration initially was opposed to the Magnitsky Act because then-President Barack Obama was seeking a “reset” with Russia and did not want to deepen the divide between the two countries.Former President Bill Clinton’s speech to Renaissance just weeks later was all the more curious, considering Renaissance’s Russian investment bank executives would have been banned from the U.S. under the law. Fast-forward to 2015, and the timeline apparently had caught the attention of Bloomberg News. Related ImageExpand / CollapsePortrait of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky held by his mother Nataliya Magnitskaya during 2009 press conference in Moscow.  (The Associated Press)According to a memo from Clinton’s presidential campaign team later published by WikiLeaks , however, the Clinton campaign was able to stop the presses.“With the help of the research team, we killed a Bloomberg story trying to link HRC’s opposition to the Magnitsky bill a $500,000 speech that WJC gave in Moscow,” Jesse Lehrich, on the Rapid Response Communications team for Hillary For America, boasted on May 21, 2015. The Global Magnitsky Act was named for 36-year-old tax attorney Sergei Magnitsky, who died in the custody of the Russian government after accusing the government and organized crime of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from a foreign company, Hermitage Capital Management. Magnitsky, hired by foreign investor and Hermitage owner William Browder, had tracked what turned out to be hundreds of millions of dollars in tax fraud. He reported the fraud to the Russian authorities, but instead of pursuing charges against the alleged offender, Russian authorities jailed Magnitsky.After Magnitsky died in November 2009, Browder said Magnitsky proved Renaissance officials were among those orchestrating the scheme. The State Department finally reversed its position in 2011 and refused visas to some Russians purportedly involved in the financial fraud seeking to enter the country.The Magnitsky Act passed with bipartisan support in 2012.Russia retaliated against the U.S., ending any possibility for Americans to adopt Russian orphans and also banning 18 U.S. officials from entering their country.Malia Zimmerman is an award-winning investigative reporter focusing on crime, homeland security, illegal immigration crime, terrorism and political corruption.

That decision, to play both sides and continue the divisiveness of Barack Obama, has now cost them dearly.Nike, the largest athletic company and number one sponsor of professional sports in the world, has canceled all dealings with the Dallas Cowboys. Company CEO Isaac P. Freely told Fox Sports:“To come out on the field and kneel to thugs and criminals just before saluting the flag was a reprehensible move our company won’t easily forgive. The Dallas Cowboys are no longer licensed to wear, display or sell merchandise with the Nike name or logo on it.”Owner Jerry Jones says he will fight the move, stating that he was showing his players that he was with them but still managed to see that every one of them stood for the National Anthem.Sorry, Jerry, but it isn’t about the National Anthem anymore, it’s about respect. Those people should just take their “protests” to places where they’re welcome.Share This As American As Apple Pie Article Now!11.9k	1.0

Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, told Fox News host Sean Hannity on Friday that he discovered Friday that it fell to him to shut down the government — “which is kind of cool.”Welcome to the whatever shutdown.The attitude permeating the Trump administration reflects, to some degree, the confidence that comes from finding that the world keeps spinning every time they do something they’ve been warned would have dire consequences, like withdrawing from the Paris climate accord or announcing plans to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.According to a half-dozen White House officials and outside advisers, Trump is viewing the shutdown through a similar lens, a view encouraged by White House aides, including senior adviser Stephen Miller and congressional liaison Marc Short, who urged him on Friday not to give in to Democratic demands, particularly on immigration.Several presidential advisers expressed confidence that Democrats, who offered no philosophical objections to the 30-day continuing resolution approved by House Republicans, wanted to make a statement but don’t want to hurt federal workers, tens of thousands of whom will be staying home from work without pay if government funding isn’t restored by Monday morning.Two presidential aides said they expect the current crisis to be resolved by the end of the weekend.But Democrats themselves are sending a different message, at least publicly — giving no indication they are ready to buckle to pressure. “It’s important,” Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said of the shutdown’s impact on federal workers. “But I was just at the women’s march this morning, and there are a lot of federal workers there and … they were basically: ‘You need to stand up to this guy.’”One House Democrat said he was relieved his party had finally “grown a spine.”The most reliable politics newsletter.Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning — in your inbox.EmailSign UpBy signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.The White House has responded by shrugging it off, hewing to a consistent message: This shutdown won’t hurt as much as the one President Barack Obama oversaw five years ago.Mulvaney drew the comparison repeatedly on Saturday, telling reporters that national parks and monuments would remain open, though they were closed in 2013; that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would continue to protect Americans from this year’s flu outbreak; and that, in another departure from five years ago, the activities of the Environmental Protection Agency would continue uninterrupted.He also argued that Democrats today are being more unreasonable than were Republicans in 2013. “We were asked to vote for something in 2013 that we did not approve of,” said Mulvaney, who, as a South Carolina congressman, supported the 2013 shutdown because the government-funding bill required lawmakers to approve funding for Obamacare, a federal program to which they vehemently objected.Other West Wing aides were playing it cool as well.Whose Fault Is the Shutdown?By POLITICO STAFF“This seems so banal compared to 2013, when the two sides were actually fired up and there was a cause,” said a senior presidential aide. The 2013 shutdown, precipitated by Republican attempts to prevent funds from flowing to the Affordable Care Act, lasted 17 days. “Everybody figures this is going to resolve itself by the end of the weekend,” the aide said.“It will be nothing compared to Obama’s shutdown,” said another senior White House official, though the 2013 shutdown was roundly blamed on Republicans.Trump himself, who has yet to appear in public since the shutdown early Saturday morning, is sticking with the message that Democrats will take most of the heat, though he privately joked to staff that he knows he’ll get blamed — because he always does.Though he hasn’t appeared before the cameras, he was active on Twitter throughout the day on Saturday, writing: “This is the One Year Anniversary of my Presidency and the Democrats wanted to give me a nice present. #DemocratShutdown .”In photos released late Saturday by the White House, Trump and top staff appeared relaxed and smiling.Joyce N. Boghosian/Official White House photoWhite House aides said that they think Trump’s Twitter microphone is enough, and they don’t believe the president needs to make official remarks to bring the shutdown to a close.Indeed, Trump’s own erratic behavior in negotiations last week — including his remarks to lawmakers that many immigrants come from “shithole” countries — helped precipitate the breakdown in spending talks on the Hill by hardening the positions among party rank-and-file on both sides and giving Democrats a ready-made excuse to walk away from the negotiating table on immigration.Since then, he’s been a bit player in the shutdown drama — the absence of his direction and leadership driving events more than their presence.By BRENT D. GRIFFITHSThe irony is that while many had high hopes that Trump’s election augured a new era of bipartisanship in the country, the government shutdown is the clearest evidence yet that that hasn’t materialized.Instead, a year into his first term, the president — who won the election railing against the political system — finds himself trapped inside it, waiting for the political leaders he holds in contempt to set him free.Annie Karni and Seung Min Kim contributed to this report.	1.0

Not once have you read where I said that the fish were not being affected. I am simply stating this article is BS and even their source says it. I am pointing out the danger in articles such as this.

He relies on his readers being too stupid to even look at the source he links to. And apparently he is right, most of the people commenting didn't even bother.

Portlands city council on Wednesday voted 3 to 1 in favor of the Equal Use Act, a new resolution granting individuals who identify as furries the same rights afforded to dogs and their respective owners who frequent popular off-leash areas and dog parks in the greater Portland area.The decision comes on the heels of a four-day sit-in organized by PDX Furs, a regional furry community based in the Portland metro area, which staged the protest at Portlands city council offices on Milwaukie Avenue last weekend. This is a huge victory, said Bo Kirkman. Not just for furries here in Portland but furries living all across the United States.Bo, a former kindergarten teacher and self-described furry rights advocate, told the Portland Tribune that he identifies as a dog. Its one thing to say you cant bring your cat or your ferret or whatever to the off-leash areas because obviously theyre not dogs. But if I want to go to the park and play with my owner, well as a canine, that should be my right.Now, thanks to the City of Portland, Bo and his fellow furries can take advantage of the citys designated off-leash areas. Provided they respect and adhere to the posted rules and regulations at our city parks, said Public Affairs commissioner Dan Saltzman who sits on the city council and voted in favor of the resolution.According to the City of Portlands official website, dog park visitors are expected to pick up and dispose of their pets waste and are advised to leave sick animals at home. In an effort to prevent the spread of disease, we ask that owners refrain from allowing their dogs  or furries  drink from standing water, Saltzman said.However, not everyone is celebrating the new resolution.. I think its rediculous, said council-member Amanda Fritz who sits on the Portland Parks Board and voted against the proposal. Were allowing people in costumes to frolic about and fornicate to their hearts content in our public parks.Mrs. Fritz may be alone in her sentiments. Portland mayor Charlie Hales told the Daily Journal of Commerce that the Equal Use Act is synonymous with Portlands unofficial slogan. Keep Portland weird, quoted Mayor Hales before adding, That is precisely what we intend to do.Share the News:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)MoreClick to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)Tags:animal costumes, defecate, dog parks, furries, keep portland weird, mate, off-leash areas, oregon, portland, public urination, real news right now, realnewsrightnow, realnewsrightnow.com, rights, sex, voyeurism  R.

It’s a double standard. There shouldn’t be a black history month. We’re Americans, period.” Well, she definitely started a conversation… and has agreement in unexpected places:1.  Listen to what famous rapper Waka Flocka said:He said:“But honestly, I always felt like that. Like why the f**k we got BET? BET is for black people and MTV is for white people? Think about it. Why the f**k we got Black History Month only in February? How can the people that took our history, give us our history for one month? Just think about it.”I have to admit, I don’t know who “Waka Flocka” is, or what he sings, but I agree with him on this! 2.  Listen to what rapper, writer, actor, director Ice Cube said about the  #OscarSoWhite controversy :“We don’t do movies for the industry. We do movies for the fans, for the people,” Ice Cube said Friday. “To cry about not winning an award is like crying because you don’t have enough icing on your cake!”Though he didn’t mention Stacey by name, isn’t it interesting how he echoed her sentiments exactly?We shouldn’t segregate ourselves or limit Black History Month to one month a year. I wish things were really colorblind… I don’t know what we can do as a society to come together as one.Ss far as what I have seen about the #OscarSoWhiteControversy, it seems  Jada Smith started it because her husband wasn’t getting nominated.I don’t know how other people think about it, but I hope my son sees early on – that not everyone gets a trophy.Buy my Mom’s new devotional, Sweet Freedom, in bookstores everywhere!	1.0

The explosion, which appears to have originated in the basement, was heard nearly three miles away. The closest neighbor, a farm nearly a mile away, felt what they thought was a “mild earthquake. When first-responders arrived on site, they found a huge hole in the center of the ranch and bodies strewn about the surrounding area.Fire Marshall Sandy Batternofski said that the blast looked like the product of some sort of illegal activity:“There was a massive amount of pressure built up from something before it ignited. Then it burned so fast it incinerated everything in its path. The victims look like overcooked chicken wings. Gonna be tough to ID them.”We asked Police Chief Matt Schmidt what he thought and he never skipped a beat when he said:“Meth. No doubt about it. Al’s got some explaining to do.”Ex-Senator Franken, who lives in a penthouse in Minneapolis with his mistress, told police he hadn’t been to the ranch in over a year and that his brother Randy was looking after it for him. When asked about the obvious existence of a meth lab, Franken snorted and hung up the phone.We’ll update the story when the bodies are identified.     .About Flagg Eagleton  44 ArticlesFlagg Eagleton is the son of an American potato farmer and a patriot.

He was taking summer classes at his high school and left the classroom for what was supposed to be a quick call to a documentary crew preparing a feature on the rivalry with De La Salle High School in Northern California.“I stepped outside to make the phone call and I ran into a classmate of mine,” Banks says.Her name was Wanetta Gibson. She was a friend. She was 15.“We met, hugged, started talking and agreed to go to an area on our campus that was known as a make-out area,” Banks says. “We went to this area and made out. We never had sex.”By the end of the day, Banks was in custody, accused of raping Gibson on the school’s campus. But we never had sex, Banks pleaded. Nobody believed him.“I was being arrested and accused of kidnapping and rape,” he says. “I was taken into custody that same day and the judge put a bail on me that was too high for me to post bond. It was over $1 million.”He languished in juvenile hall for an entire year before his case came up. He was to be tried as an adult and if found guilty, faced 41 years to life. His football dreams effectively died that summer day in the stairwell of his school.Life isn’t fair.Brian Banks was an innocent man.Brian Banks weeps upon hearing judge clear his name in May of 2012.(Brittany Murray/ASSOCIATED PRESS)***After turning down three plea deals that would have put him in prison for 25, 18 or nine years, Banks was told on the day of jury selection “that I had no chance in trial because I was a big, black teenager and the jury would be an all-white jury and they would automatically assume me as guilty because of that,” Banks says.Gibson was also black, as was Banks’ attorney. As the jury was about to be selected, Banks was offered a deal to plead guilty to one count of rape under the condition that the other charges would be dropped. He would then undergo a 90-day observation at Chino State prison and would be interviewed and evaluated by psychologists and counselors “who would determine on a ladder system whether I would receive probation or three or six years prison,” Banks says. “I was promised and guaranteed by my attorney that I would get probation if I took the plea. I was also told that if I didn’t take it, I would more than likely be found guilty and receive life in prison.”He was 17 years old. “Do I plead to a crime that I did not commit and receive a small sentence or do I roll the dice, risk my entire life behind bars for a crime I didn’t commit?” he says. “I realized that day, regardless of whatever my decision was, neither one of them was going home an innocent man.”All he could think about was getting his life back, going home, playing football, finishing his high school education, enrolling at USC. They put him in a room and gave him 10 minutes to make his decision. He sat there crying. “I was unable to speak to my mom. I was denied that right,” he says. “At the age of 17, I felt like 90 days was doable after already spending a year behind bars.”He underwent the 90-day observation. The psychologist and counselor recommended probation. The judge gave him six years. He had never been in trouble before, not even a speeding ticket. He sat in the holding cell, held both hands up, shaking uncontrollably as he figured out that he would have to serve 85% of the six years. He had already served one year. That meant he still had just over four years remaining.“Just the trauma and the stress that I had already dealt with that first year, it was unimaginable how I was going to do another four years,” he says.He went to jail with career criminals. He was angry, depressed, hostile. He saw fights, stabbings, killings right in front of him, riots, lockdowns.He saw hell.Banks lost 10 years of his life, a frightful five years and two months in prison followed by five years of high custody parole.After his release in 2007, he moved back in with his mother, a second-grade schoolteacher who had sold her house and car to pay his attorney fees. At 22 he tried to resume his football career at Long Beach City College. He played in a game two days after his release, a good way to take out aggression. But after playing a handful of games before the season ended, a new law went into effect in California requiring sex offenders to wear an ankle GPS tracking device, making it impossible for him to play football.He had already registered as a sex offender and couldn’t live within 2,000 yards of a school or park. He had trouble finding work.“I wanted revenge,” Banks says. “I wanted people to be held accountable for the things that happened to me.”The past is the past. It already happened. Tomorrow is a mystery.Life’s not fair, Banks thought. I’m an innocent man.***Three years ago, Banks was checking his Facebook account and got a start. He had been home for four years working odd jobs, still carrying the label of sex offender. But there, staring him in the face, was a friend request.“It was her,” Banks says, “the girl who had accused me nine years ago.”Banks still doesn’t know her reasoning for selling him down the river when she knew they never had sex and there was no DNA trace on her underwear. Maybe it was the $1.5 million she collected from the Long Beach school system, claiming it was an unsafe environment (the city is trying to recoup $2.6 million from her now). Banks thinks maybe Gibson was afraid her older sister, who went to the same high school, would find out she made out with him and tell her mother. Or that he would brag to friends. Maybe she thought he would just be suspended. He doesn’t think she was trying to put him in jail. He also thinks perhaps a school security guard saw her leaving the stairwell with him, asked what she was doing and if she wanted to do it.“Oh well, then he raped you,” Banks surmises the guard said.“We don’t really know what the truth really is as to why she lied,” he says. “I never really got a clear reason.”Banks never had contact with her from the day they made out until that day on Facebook in 2011.He asked why she would request him.“I was hoping we could let bygones be bygones,” Banks says Gibson wrote. “I was immature back in the day, but I’m much more mature now. Let’s hang out. I’d love to see you. I’ve seen your picture on Facebook. You look real good. I would love to hook up.”Banks obviously had no interest.His parole agreement didn’t allow him any contact with her. Banks called a private investigator and said he felt there was an opportunity for her to tell the truth and he wanted it recorded.“In the event that I violated my parole conditions coming into contact with her and was sent back to prison, I wanted them to at least know what was said,” Banks says. “I took a big risk. I knew this was the only opportunity to prove my innocence by her admitting she lied.”In 2013, Atlanta's Brian Banks faces Cincinnati.(Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images)He invited Wanetta Gibson to the investigator’s office. They spoke with the investigator monitoring in another room. Banks wanted her to understand what she did to his life. He asked her to come back the second day to speak to the investigator.“Did he rape you? Did he kidnap you?” the investigator asked.Banks said she laughed it off and said, “Of course not. If he raped me, I wouldn’t be here right now. We were just young and having a good time, being curious, then all these other people got involved and blew it out of proportion.”It was all on tape. Banks took it to the California Innocence Project, which took his case and appealed it.One year later, three months before he was to come off parole, Banks was cleared.On May 24, 2012, the same Los Angeles Superior Court judge who had sentenced Banks to six years in prison when he begrudgingly accepted a plea bargain for a crime he did not commit after he was led to believe he would get probation, took less than one minute to dismiss his conviction.He was already a free man. But now he had his freedom.“My record is cleaner than yours,” he says.He’s not bitter, he’s not looking for an apology. He didn’t sue anybody.“When you put yourself in position where you have to make a decision whether you forgive somebody or you don’t, that means you are still dealing with it,” Banks says. “I’m not dealing with it anymore. The past is the past. It already happened. Tomorrow is a mystery.”***Banks tried football again after gaining back his full freedom. Carroll, the coach Banks wanted to play for at Southern Cal and the first coach to give him a tryout once he was exonerated in 2012, and who will be coaching in his second consecutive Super Bowl next Sunday, brought him to Seattle for a tryout the day after all charges were dropped.Banks remembers when his cell phone rang.Brian Banks has a moment with his mother, Leomia Myers and father, Jonathan Banks, outside courthouse.(Nick Ut/ASSOCIATED PRESS)“I’m looking for a linebacker. You know where I can find one?” the caller says.“You got the right number. Who is this?” Banks says.“Pete Carroll,” he says. “You’ve been out of the game 10 years. I don’t know what the hell you can do. But I’m going to fly you out here because I know how hard you work. I just want to see what you can do.”One year before he was exonerated, Banks had been up to 290 pounds. He then started training and within three months was down to 245 pounds when he went to Seattle.“It was a terrible tragedy in a young man’s life, to be falsely accused like that and have to give up years of his life,” Carroll said in an e-mail to the Daily News. “I don’t think anyone could’ve handled something like that any better. He was strong, gracious and compassionate, and he exhibited great character and integrity.”Banks was thrilled to hear from Carroll.“We reconnected and it was like we were back on that same path to where we left off recruiting,” he says. “Here we were once again.”But the football part didn’t work out. It had been too long.“I tried out. They were impressed,” Banks says. “They invited me back to camp. I trained in camp with them. They decided it was a little premature and they decided not to roll with me.”He had tryouts with the 49ers, Chiefs, Vikings, Chargers, Eagles and Falcons.Nobody signed him. It had been 10 years since he had really played.“You could tell he had missed some years of ball,” Carroll says. “He missed out on the physical development a college athlete gets and all that comes with that process. He missed the opportunity to hone his physical and mental skills as it relates to football, but his competitiveness shined through and he battled so hard for that chance, and did a phenomenal job with his opportunity.”Former Giants coach Jim Fassel then signed Banks for the Las Vegas Locomotives of the United Football League. He played linebacker and special teams before the league folded during the 2012 season after Banks had played in just a couple of games.Brian Banks exits court after his kidnap-rape conviction was dismissed.(Brittany Murray/AP)“I heard about his story and as a coach, you just say ‘Gosh sakes, what this man has gone through and his attitude is still positive,’ ” Fassel says by phone last week. “This guy deserved somebody to give him a chance. It was amazing he wasn’t bitter, but he was really, really raw.”The Falcons reached out again in 2013, signed him in the offseason, brought him to camp. He played in all four preseason games, but was let go on the final cut from 75 players to 53.Banks, officially, was done. He was just 28 years old. His formative years in football were spent shuttling between adult prisons in California.“He was an all-star player and set himself apart in high school, so if he had gotten the chance, it’s clear he definitely could’ve been a legitimate NFL prospect,” Carroll said.***Who knows what would have happened to Banks if his life had not been derailed?“I don’t really wonder. I know,” Banks says. “I know I would have been a force to be reckoned with in the NFL.""Banks is 29 now and dressed in a dark suit sitting in the office of Troy Vincent, the NFL’s executive vice president of football operations, in the league’s Park Avenue headquarters. He began working for the NFL in the football operations department at the beginning of the 2014 season. On game days, he helps out in the officiating department with replays.Vincent and Roger Goodell brought him in because he’s a bright and eager guy. He also has a riveting message that might make an impact on some of the players in the NFL.“Very few people could even endure what happened to Brian, much less emerge with such resilience and determination,” Vincent says. “I saw a young man who was dealt a bad hand, but he refused to allow it to deter him from pursuing his dream to be part of the NFL.""Now he might be on his way to becoming a star in the NFL office.“He’s a great guy,” Goodell says.For Banks, the dream is once again alive.“If you ask me, I made an NFL roster and that’s here in the front office in New York,” he says. “I still wear the shield. I accomplished a dream that was taken away from me.”He now does volunteer work for the California Innocence Project. A movie is being made about his life. Banks also has developed a business speaking to schools all over the country. He has a strong message and an appropriate T-shirt.It’s a California license plate that says, XONR8. Sign up for BREAKING NEWS Emails"	1.0

The man in the video, Greig Tonkins (who is reportedly a zookeeper), was on a boar-hunting trip with a number of his friends, including Kailem, a 19-year-old guy who passed away last week after a battle with Ewing Sarcoma. The footage was from a longer video clip shot by another friend, Greg Bloom, who was documenting their boar hunting (word is that they were trying to get Kailem a ""tonner,"" a.k.a. a wild boar weighing in at around ~220 lbs.).Tonkins&apos; dog Max got caught in a kangaroo headlock was one of a pack who were helping on the hunt. Apparently this is how kangaroos act in the wild some times? Whatever the case may be, Tonkins says he only ""stunned"" the kangaroo during their fist fight (hence the &apos;roo and his ""WTF"" face), with his friend Matthew Amor telling news.com.au that it was funny because the guy who did it is the most placid bloke.

https://www.snopes.com/cashews-equivalent-to-a-dose-of-prozac/	Are Two Handfuls of Cashews Equivalent to a Dose of Prozac for Depression?	false	['antidepressants', ' dangerous memes', ' david avocado wolfe', ' depression', ' newz magazine']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/9n36j	2016/12/30	SEND Pinterest Google Skype Reddit-Cashew nuts are one of the healthiest foods in the world. Unfortunately, not many of you know the numerous benefits they offer, and only a very small percentage of the natural medicines comprehensive database is dedicated to them.Countries like Nigeria, Tanzania, Mozambique and Brazil are the biggest producers of cashew nuts, mostly due to the fact that they need hot and humid climate in order to grow.Health Benefits of Cashew NutsCashew nuts are rich in vitamins, soluble dietary fiber, minerals and many phytochemicals that prevent diseases, including cancers. Cashews are also rich in calories, about 50 grams of these favorable foods contain 275 calories.These beneficial nuts provide numerous essential vitamins, including pantothenic acid or vitamin B5, pyridoxine or vitamin B6, thiamin or vitamin B11 and riboflavinThe aforementioned vitamins are crucial for metabolism of fat, protein and carbs at a cellular level. On the other hand, niacin improves the protection against pellagra or dermatitis.Furthermore, B6 is extremely beneficial for our health for it significantly lowers the chances of developing sideroblastic anemia and homocystinuria. Only 3.5 Oz (100 gr) of these nuts provide about 30% of daily recommended levels of B6 (that’s about 0.147 mg).Moreover, cashews are also rich in essential minerals. Some of the most useful minerals found in cashew nuts are potassium, manganese, copper, selenium, magnesium, zinc and iron. Only a handful of these nuts on a daily basis can provide the necessary amount of these extremely needed minerals and protect you from deficiency- related diseases.For instance, copper acts as a co-factor for many important enzymes, like superoxide dismutase and cytochrome c- oxidase. Zinc, on the other hand, plays the same role together with enzymes that are responsible for the regulation of the growth and progress of digestion, gonadal function and DNA synthesis. Selenium is a very important micronutrient and it works as a co-factor for antioxidant enzymes like Glutathione peroxides, known as one of the strongest antioxidants in human body.Monounsaturated fatty acids which are in high quantities in these nuts are extremely good for the heart health, as palmitoleic and oleic acids. They belong to the group of essential fatty acids that can increase the level of good HDL cholesterol and decrease the level of harmful LDLcholesterol in our blood. In addition, as shown by many scientific studies, the so-called Mediterranean diet which is mostly based on monounsaturated fatty acids supports the blood lipid profile, and protect our system from strokes and coronary artery diseases.Furthermore, cashews also contain a small quantity of one very important pigment of flavonoid antioxidants, called zeaxanthin, which is selectively absorbed inside the retinal macula in our eyes. This pigment provides protective and antioxidant UV ray filtering features, and it also protects from ARMD or age-related macular degeneration in old people.How Treat Depression Naturally – A Basic Guide to Cashew NutritionCashew nuts are more than great source of tryptophan, which is a vital amino acid our body needs to take it throughout the food. This amino acid helps children develop and grow, regulates mood, balances our behavior, improves sleep and can significantly lower the level of stress, anxiety and depression.Just two handfuls of cashews contain somewhere between 1.000 and 2.000 mg of tryptophan. This compound has been proven to be as equally successful as prescription antidepressants. The best thing about treating depression with cashews is that you will surely avoid side effects that are usually caused by antidepressants. Of course, this is yet another thing big pharma carefully hides from us.According to FDA Deputy Commissioner for Policy’s David Adams, who was part of the Drug Information Association Annual Meeting back in 1993, we need to pay close attention to the things happening around the legal arena and dietary supplements. If producers of natural remedies manage getting the support, there will most likely be a completely new class of products, which will be competing with the already existing drugs. This is why we need a special law that will have the function to regulate the supplements.In addition, back in 1993, FDA Dietary Task Force has released a report saying that the selling and existence of dietary supplements will not jeopardize efforts for creating new drugs.Sponsored by Revcontent	1.0

The 2003 painting by Simmie Knox shows a smiling Clinton sporting one of her signature pantsuits, standing by a table with her book, “It Takes a Village,” by her side.ADVERTISEMENTThe White House calls this year’s theme “The Gift of the Holidays,” one that “reflects on not only the joy of giving and receiving, but also the true gifts of life, such as service, friends and family, education, and good health.”Supersized versions of the presidential pooches, Bo and Sunny, greet guests in the East Wing Hallway. The first dog-inspired creations, which measured slightly taller than ITK’s towering 5’4” frame, were crafted from more than 25,000 yarn pom-poms.A tree adorned with gold stars represents “The Gift of Service,” which pays homage to first lady Michelle ObamaMichelle LeVaughn Robinson Obama Michelle Obama celebrates success of ‘Black Panther’ How textbooks shape teachers — not just their students Michelle Obama dedicates Valentine's Day playlist to Barack Obama MORE and Dr. Jill Biden’s Joining Forces initiative, aimed at supporting military service members and their families. Kiosks with touch screens can be used to pen a note to send to troops.Another snowy display might prove more controversial. Not only do snowmen occupy the space next to the Clinton portrait — they line the entire hall.Similar snowmen stoked fear among the Washington press corps last year, when ITK tweeted a picture of a countless number of ever-smiling figures peering into the White House from outside. Bloomberg White House correspondent Justin Sink dubbed the frozen creatures “nightmare fuel.”But everything is awesome in the State Dining Room, with 56 gingerbread houses — one for each state and territory — created out of Legos. South Dakota’s gingerbread house features a pretty impressive Lego version of Mount Rushmore. More than 200,000 of the colorful blocks were used to decorate the room, and Lego master builders spent 500 hours designing and crafting the structures.In the Green and Red rooms, visitors can find a seasonal ode to Michelle Obama’s “Let’s Move!” anti-childhood obesity initiative, with wreaths made of lemons and garlands created using limes. The fruit-filled rooms also feature gift boxes made out of cranberries.This year’s White House gingerbread house was whipped up using 150 pounds of gingerbread on the inside and 100 pounds of bread dough on the outside. The behemoth baked good also includes 20 pounds of gum paste, 20 pounds of icing and 20 pounds of sculpted sugar pieces.A sugary sweet Bo and Sunny stand outside the massive confection, along with a giant gingerbread man and woman. The gingerbread woman is seen holding a gingerbread baby.But even the spicy-sweet smell of the sugar-coated display couldn’t get one journalist salivating over the gigantic treat. “Can we all accept now that gingerbread is only good as a building material?” a photographer quipped. 	1.0

Brendan McDermid/ReutersShareU.S.Last week, Bill O’Reilly returned from a European vacation to find that he had been fired from Fox News for a history of alleged sexual misbehavior that is impressively wide-ranging, even for the Viagra warehouse that has functioned for near decades as the mouthpiece of the Republican Party.This week, O’Reilly left for vacation again; his destination this time was not Italy but the Isle of Unreality, a remote location favored by right-wingers seeking to escape lawsuits and facts.No longer will O’Reilly be a factor, so to speak, in the fortunes of the right-wing cable news channel that brought his visage, puckered with outrage, into the homes of millions. Even as advertisers fled his show over the past two months, he crushed the competition like a Republican congressman in Texas, drawing 3.8 million per night viewers in early April. Now, all he has is a measly podcast, No Spin News, and a website that does an excellent impression of 1999.Keep up with this story and more by subscribing nowO’Reilly’s first post-firing podcast went live on Monday. Television endowed O’Reilly with a kind of gleeful menace that was weirdly captivating for those of us who disagreed with him on everything, including the title of “journalist” he gave himself; unseen, he loses power—and seems to know it. Yet at heart, the project is the same, a promise of “no spin” bolstered by sturdy beams of vitriol and misinformation.O’Reilly began with pure, uncut, right-into-your-bloodstream spin, also known as damage control. “I am sad that I am not on television anymore,” he said. “I was surprised how it all turned out.” He may mean that he thought the $13 million he and Fox News paid out to various accusers ensured their silence. Or maybe he thought that a recent endorsement from Donald Trump—“I don't think Bill did anything wrong”—would save him.But O’Reilly really wasn’t going to spend all his podcast time talking about that unseemly business, not with the forces of liberalism amassing at the borders of Real America. There was much news to cover, many spins to un-spin or stop the spins from spinning or cause to the spins to spin in a countervailing motion, thereby creating a spin-neutral zone. He began by denouncing numbers, specifically those tied to President Trump’s approval ratings. If those numbers seem low, he explained, it’s not because Trump has been an ineffectual, easily distracted head of state but because the mainstream media “deceive” Americans “on a daily basis.”I can’t claim to be a regular Fox News viewer, but I’ve seen and heard enough of O’Reilly (Mom loves the guy…) to know that something was amiss on this podcast. The day’s news was a slab of red meat, but instead of tearing into it, O’Reilly timidly nibbled at the edges. When I hear the boredom in O’Reilly’s voice, I worry for the future of the Republic.“Don’t react to these polls,” he advised Trump, like a weary coach telling his charges to hustle. O’Reilly had to know that Trump had already reacted to those polls on Twitter (you can imagine how), so why offer political advice that’s not only hackneyed but outdated?Little else about the 20-minute show was remarkable—which was the most remarkable thing about it. Without much gusto, he covered the French election (“Marnie” Le Pen) and conservative commentator Ann Coulter’s feud with the University of California at Berkeley (“a place I would never in a million years go to”).“Interesting,” he said of the Berkeley issue. “Very, very interesting.” To show just how interesting it was, he followed with a long “um…”Frankly, I could have used a little, um, spin. In what I take as an ominous sign, the word of the day flashed in a banner atop the O’Reilly website. The word on Monday was sciolistic, which means “concerned with or comprehending only what is apparent or obvious; not deep or penetrating emotionally or intellectually.”Was some dastardly young web editor trolling O’Reilly? Or was O’Reilly nobly unspinning himself? The latter is unlikely. Like the man in the Oval Office, O’Reilly never backs down when presented with evidence of his own misconduct or deception. To the contrary, both men puff up their chests and grow indignant, mistakenly thinking that they stand on high ground, when they are in fact treading along the crumbling edge of a cliff.“I’m very confident the truth will come out,” O’Reilly said at the opening of his podcast.It already has, Bill."	1.0

Pedophiles to FBI?	false	['fake news', ' harvey weinstein', ' hollywood', ' neon nettle', ' sexual assault']	https://www.nytimes.com/	https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html	2017/10/21	Harvey Weinstein Paid Off Sexual Harassment Accusers for DecadesImageHarvey Weinstein apologized for behavior that he said “has caused a lot of pain.”CreditJean Baptiste LaCroix/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesBy Jodi Kantor and Megan TwoheyOct. 5, 2017Update: The Weinstein Company’s board has fired Harvey Weinstein after reports of sexual harassment complaints against him. Find more coverage here .Two decades ago, the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein invited Ashley Judd to the Peninsula Beverly Hills hotel for what the young actress expected to be a business breakfast meeting. Instead, he had her sent up to his room, where he appeared in a bathrobe and asked if he could give her a massage or she could watch him shower, she recalled in an interview.“How do I get out of the room as fast as possible without alienating Harvey Weinstein?” Ms. Judd said she remembers thinking.In 2014, Mr. Weinstein invited Emily Nestor, who had worked just one day as a temporary employee, to the same hotel and made another offer: If she accepted his sexual advances, he would boost her career, according to accounts she provided to colleagues who sent them to Weinstein Company executives. The following year, once again at the Peninsula, a female assistant said Mr. Weinstein badgered her into giving him a massage while he was naked, leaving her “crying and very distraught,” wrote a colleague, Lauren O’Connor, in a searing memo asserting sexual harassment and other misconduct by their boss.“There is a toxic environment for women at this company,” Ms. O’Connor said in the letter, addressed to several executives at the company run by Mr. Weinstein.An investigation by The New York Times found previously undisclosed allegations against Mr. Weinstein stretching over nearly three decades, documented through interviews with current and former employees and film industry workers, as well as legal records, emails and internal documents from the businesses he has run, Miramax and the Weinstein Company.During that time, after being confronted with allegations including sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact, Mr. Weinstein has reached at least eight settlements with women, according to two company officials speaking on the condition of anonymity. Among the recipients, The Times found, were a young assistant in New York in 1990, an actress in 1997, an assistant in London in 1998, an Italian model in 2015 and Ms. O’Connor shortly after, according to records and those familiar with the agreements.In a statement to The Times on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Weinstein said: “I appreciate the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it. Though I’m trying to do better, I know I have a long way to go.”He added that he was working with therapists and planning to take a leave of absence to “deal with this issue head on.”Lisa Bloom, a lawyer advising Mr. Weinstein, said in a statement that “he denies many of the accusations as patently false.” In comments to The Times earlier this week, Mr. Weinstein said that many claims in Ms. O’Connor’s memo were “off base” and that they had parted on good terms.ImageSome of Mr. Weinstein’s films include, from left to right, “Sex, Lies, and Videotape,” “Pulp Fiction” and “Good Will Hunting.”He and his representatives declined to comment on any of the settlements, including providing information about who paid them. But Mr. Weinstein said that in addressing employee concerns about workplace issues, “my motto is to keep the peace.”Ms. Bloom, who has been advising Mr. Weinstein over the last year on gender and power dynamics, called him “an old dinosaur learning new ways.” She said she had “explained to him that due to the power difference between a major studio head like him and most others in the industry, whatever his motives, some of his words and behaviors can be perceived as inappropriate, even intimidating.”Though Ms. O’Connor had been writing only about a two-year period, her memo echoed other women’s complaints. Mr. Weinstein required her to have casting discussions with aspiring actresses after they had private appointments in his hotel room, she said, her description matching those of other former employees. She suspected that she and other female Weinstein employees, she wrote, were being used to facilitate liaisons with “vulnerable women who hope he will get them work.”The allegations piled up even as Mr. Weinstein helped define popular culture. He has collected six best-picture Oscars and turned out a number of touchstones, from the films “ Sex, Lies, and Videotape ,” “ Pulp Fiction ” and “ Good Will Hunting ” to the television show “ Project Runway .” In public, he presents himself as a liberal lion, a champion of women and a winner of not just artistic but humanitarian awards.In 2015, the year Ms. O’Connor wrote her memo, his company distributed “ The Hunting Ground ,” a documentary about campus sexual assault. A longtime Democratic donor, he hosted a fund-raiser for Hillary Clinton in his Manhattan home last year. He employed Malia Obama, the oldest daughter of former President Barack Obama, as an intern this year, and recently helped endow a faculty chair at Rutgers University in Gloria Steinem’s name. During the Sundance Film Festival in January, when Park City, Utah, held its version of nationwide women’s marches, Mr. Weinstein joined the parade.ImageHarvey Weinstein and Hillary Clinton in 2012. Mr. Weinstein held a fund-raiser for Mrs. Clinton at his Manhattan home last year.CreditLarry Busacca/Getty Images“From the outside, it seemed golden — the Oscars, the success, the remarkable cultural impact,” said Mark Gill, former president of Miramax Los Angeles when the company was owned by Disney. “But behind the scenes, it was a mess, and this was the biggest mess of all,” he added, referring to Mr. Weinstein’s treatment of women.Dozens of Mr. Weinstein’s former and current employees, from assistants to top executives, said they knew of inappropriate conduct while they worked for him. Only a handful said they ever confronted him.Mr. Weinstein enforced a code of silence; employees of the Weinstein Company have contracts saying they will not criticize it or its leaders in a way that could harm its “business reputation” or “any employee’s personal reputation,” a recent document shows. And most of the women accepting payouts agreed to confidentiality clauses prohibiting them from speaking about the deals or the events that led to them.Charles Harder, a lawyer representing Mr. Weinstein, said it was not unusual to enter into settlements to avoid lengthy and costly litigation. He added, “It’s not evidence of anything.”At Fox News, where the conservative icons Roger E. Ailes and Bill O’Reilly were accused of harassment, women have received payouts well into the millions of dollars. But most of the women involved in the Weinstein agreements collected between roughly $80,000 and $150,000, according to people familiar with the negotiations.In the wake of Ms. O’Connor’s 2015 memo, some Weinstein Company board members and executives, including Mr. Weinstein’s brother and longtime partner, Bob , 62, were alarmed about the allegations, according to several people who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In the end, though, board members were assured there was no need to investigate. After reaching a settlement with Mr. Weinstein, Ms. O’Connor withdrew her complaint and thanked him for the career opportunity he had given her.“The parties made peace very quickly,” Ms. Bloom said.Through her lawyer, Nicole Page, Ms. O’Connor declined to be interviewed. In the memo, she explained how unnerved she was by what she witnessed or encountered while a literary scout and production executive at the company. “I am just starting out in my career, and have been and remain fearful about speaking up,” Ms. O’Connor wrote. “But remaining silent is causing me great distress.”In speaking out about her hotel episode, Ms. Judd said in a recent interview, “Women have been talking about Harvey amongst ourselves for a long time, and it’s simply beyond time to have the conversation publicly.”A Common NarrativeMs. Nestor, a law and business school student, accepted Mr. Weinstein’s breakfast invitation at the Peninsula because she did not want to miss an opportunity, she later told colleagues. After she arrived, he offered to help her career while boasting about a series of famous actresses he claimed to have slept with, according to accounts that colleagues compiled after hearing her story and then sent on to company executives.“She said he was very persistent and focused though she kept saying no for over an hour,” one internal document said. Ms. Nestor, who declined to comment for this article, refused his bargain, the records noted. “She was disappointed that he met with her and did not seem to be interested in her résumé or skill set.” The young woman chose not to report the episode to human resources personnel, but the allegations came to management’s attention through other employees.Across the years and continents, accounts of Mr. Weinstein’s conduct share a common narrative: Women reported to a hotel for what they thought were work reasons, only to discover that Mr. Weinstein, who has been married for most of three decades, sometimes seemed to have different interests. His home base was New York, but his rolling headquarters were luxury hotels: the Peninsula Beverly Hills and the Savoy in London, the Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc near the Cannes Film Festival in France and the Stein Eriksen Lodge near the Sundance Film Festival.ImageThe Peninsula Beverly Hills, a hotel where Mr. Weinstein has been accused of sexually harassing women in the entertainment industry.CreditFG/Bauer-Griffin, via Getty ImagesWorking for Mr. Weinstein could mean getting him out of bed in the morning and doing “turndown duty” late at night, preparing him for sleep. Like the colleague cited in Ms. O’Connor’s memo, some junior employees required to perform those tasks said they were disturbing.In interviews, eight women described varying behavior by Mr. Weinstein: appearing nearly or fully naked in front of them, requiring them to be present while he bathed or repeatedly asking for a massage or initiating one himself. The women, typically in their early or middle 20s and hoping to get a toehold in the film industry, said he could switch course quickly — meetings and clipboards one moment, intimate comments the next. One woman advised a peer to wear a parka when summoned for duty as a layer of protection against unwelcome advances.Laura Madden, a former employee who said Mr. Weinstein prodded her for massages at hotels in Dublin and London beginning in 1991, said he had a way of making anyone who objected feel like an outlier. “It was so manipulative,” she said in an interview. “You constantly question yourself — am I the one who is the problem?”Oct. 5, 2017“I don’t know anything about that,” Mr. Weinstein said.Most women who told The Times that they experienced misconduct by Mr. Weinstein had never met one another. They range in age from early 20s to late 40s and live in different cities. Some said they did not report the behavior because there were no witnesses and they feared retaliation by Mr. Weinstein. Others said they felt embarrassed. But most confided in co-workers.Ms. Madden later told Karen Katz, a friend and colleague in the acquisitions department, about Mr. Weinstein’s overtures, including a time she locked herself in the bathroom of his hotel room, sobbing. “We were so young at the time,” said Ms. Katz, now a documentary filmmaker. “We did not understand how wrong it was or how Laura should deal with it.”Others in the London office said the same. “I was pretty disturbed and angry,” said Sallie Hodges, another former employee, recalling the accounts she heard from colleagues. “That’s kind of the way things were.”The human resources operation was considered weak in New York and worse in London, so some employees banded together in solidarity. “If a female executive was asked to go to a meeting solo, she and a colleague would generally double up” so as not to be alone with Mr. Weinstein, recalled Mr. Gill, the former president of Miramax Los Angeles.Many women who worked with Mr. Weinstein said they never experienced sexual harassment or knew of anyone who did, and recalled him as a boss who gave them valuable opportunities at young ages. Some described long and satisfying careers with him, praising him as a mentor and advocate.But in interviews, some of the former employees who said they had troubling experiences with Mr. Weinstein asked a common question: How could allegations repeating the same pattern — young women, a powerful male producer, even some of the same hotels — have accumulated for almost three decades?“It wasn’t a secret to the inner circle,” said Kathy DeClesis, Bob Weinstein’s assistant in the early 1990s. She supervised a young woman who left the company abruptly after an encounter with Harvey Weinstein and who later received a settlement, according to several former employees.Speaking up could have been costly. A job with Mr. Weinstein was a privileged perch at the nexus of money, fame and art, and plenty of his former assistants have risen high in Hollywood. He could be charming and generous: gift baskets, flowers, personal or career help and cash. At the Cannes Film Festival, according to several former colleagues, he sometimes handed out thousands of dollars as impromptu bonuses.Mr. Weinstein was a volcanic personality, though, given to fits of rage and personal lashings of male and female employees alike. When a female guest of his had to wait for a hotel room upgrade, he yelled that Ms. O’Connor would be better off marrying a “fat, rich Jewish” man because she was probably just good for “being a wife” and “making babies,” she wrote in her memo. (He added some expletives, she said.) His treatment of women was sometimes written off as just another form of toxicity, according to multiple former employees.In the fall of 1998, a 25-year-old London assistant named Zelda Perkins confronted Mr. Weinstein. According to former colleagues, she and several co-workers had been regularly subjected to inappropriate requests or comments in hotel rooms, and she was particularly concerned about the treatment of another woman in the office. She told Mr. Weinstein that he had to stop, according to the former colleagues, and that she would go public or initiate legal action unless he changed his behavior.Steve Hutensky, one of Miramax’s entertainment lawyers, was dispatched to London to negotiate a settlement with Ms. Perkins and her lawyer. He declined to comment for this article.Ms. Perkins, now a theater producer in London, also declined to comment for this article, saying that she could not discuss her work at Miramax or whether she had entered into any agreements.Months after the settlement, Mr. Weinstein triumphed at the Oscars, with “ Life Is Beautiful ” and “ Shakespeare in Love ” winning 10 awards. A few years later, Mr. Weinstein, who had produced a series of British-themed movies, was made a Commander of the British Empire, an honorary title just short of knighthood.‘Coercive Bargaining’For actors, a meeting with Mr. Weinstein could yield dazzling rewards: scripts, parts, award campaigns, magazine coverage, influence on lucrative endorsement deals. He knew how to blast small films to box office success, and deliver polished dramas like “The King’s Speech” and popular attractions like the “Scary Movie” franchise. Mr. Weinstein’s films helped define femininity, sex and romance, from Catherine Zeta-Jones in “Chicago” to Jennifer Lawrence in “Silver Linings Playbook.”ImageThe actress Ashley Judd in the 1997 film “Kiss the Girls.” Ms. Judd said that Mr. Weinstein sexually harassed her two decades ago in his room at the Peninsula.CreditParamount Pictures, via PhotofestBut movies were also his private leverage. When Mr. Weinstein invited Ms. Judd to breakfast in Beverly Hills, she had been shooting the thriller “ Kiss the Girls ” all night, but the meeting seemed too important to miss. After arriving at the hotel lobby, she was surprised to learn that they would be talking in his suite; she decided to order cereal, she said, so the food would come quickly and she could leave.Mr. Weinstein soon issued invitation after invitation, she said. Could he give her a massage? When she refused, he suggested a shoulder rub. She rejected that too, she recalled. He steered her toward a closet, asking her to help pick out his clothing for the day, and then toward the bathroom. Would she watch him take a shower? she remembered him saying.“I said no, a lot of ways, a lot of times, and he always came back at me with some new ask,” Ms. Judd said. “It was all this bargaining, this coercive bargaining.”To get out of the room, she said, she quipped that if Mr. Weinstein wanted to touch her, she would first have to win an Oscar in one of his movies. She recalled feeling “panicky, trapped,” she said in the interview. “There’s a lot on the line, the cachet that came with Miramax.”Not long afterward, she related what had happened to her mother, the singer Naomi Judd, who confirmed their conversation to a Times reporter. Years later, Ashley Judd appeared in two Weinstein films without incident, she said. In 2015, she shared an account of the episode in the hotel room with “ Variety ” without naming the man involved.ImageIn 1997, Mr. Weinstein reached a settlement with the actor Rose McGowan after an episode in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival. She had just appeared in the movie “Scream,” above.CreditDimension Films, via PhotofestIn 1997, Mr. Weinstein reached a previously undisclosed settlement with Rose McGowan, then a 23-year-old-actress, after an episode in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival. The $100,000 settlement was “not to be construed as an admission” by Mr. Weinstein, but intended to “avoid litigation and buy peace,” according to the legal document, which was reviewed by The Times. Ms. McGowan had just appeared in the slasher film “ Scream ” and would later star in the television show “Charmed.” She declined to comment.Increased ScrutinyJust months before Ms. O’Connor wrote her memo, a young female employee quit after complaining of being forced to arrange what she believed to be assignations for Mr. Weinstein, according to two people familiar with her departure. The woman, who asked not to be identified to protect her privacy, said a nondisclosure agreement prevented her from commenting.Soon, complaints about Mr. Weinstein’s behavior prompted the board of his company to take notice.In March 2015, Mr. Weinstein had invited Ambra Battilana, an Italian model and aspiring actress, to his TriBeCa office on a Friday evening to discuss her career. Within hours, she called the police. Ms. Battilana told them that Mr. Weinstein had grabbed her breasts after asking if they were real and put his hands up her skirt, the police report says.The claims were taken up by the New York Police Department’s Special Victims Squad and splashed across the pages of tabloids, along with reports that the woman had worked with investigators to secretly record a confession from Mr. Weinstein. The Manhattan district attorney’s office later declined to bring charges.But Mr. Weinstein made a payment to Ms. Battilana, according to people familiar with the settlement, speaking on the condition of anonymity about the confidential agreement.The public nature of the episode concerned some executives and board members of the Weinstein Company. (Harvey and Bob Weinstein together own 42 percent of the privately held business.) When several board members pressed Mr. Weinstein about it, he insisted that the woman had set him up, colleagues recalled.Ms. Battilana had testified in court proceedings against associates of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy who are accused of procuring women for alleged sex parties, and the Italian news media also reported that, years ago, Ms. Battilana accused a septuagenarian boyfriend of sexual harassment, a complaint that was apparently dismissed. Ms. Battilana did not respond to requests for comment. Her lawyer, Mauro Rufini, could not be reached for comment.After the episode, Lance Maerov, a board member, said he successfully pushed for a code of behavior for the company that included detailed language about sexual harassment.Then Ms. O’Connor’s memo hit, with page after page of detailed accusations.

Use of Bluetooth-equipped devices has stretched across the globe, yet the technologys origins and name can be traced to an engineer obsessed with making computers function using as little energy as possible.Power is one of the key attributes. Battery life is life. Its the life of the product. To ignore that is totally unacceptable. You have to design things to work efficiently, but more importantly, do nothing efficiently, said Jim Kardach, retired chief power architect at Intel.Originally intended as a wireless replacement for cables to connect phones, headsets, computers, keyboards and mice, Bluetooth technology has proliferated over the past decade, allowing devices in close proximity to connect while using very little battery power.The headsets are ubiquitous, but according to the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) they are only one of many product types that make up the 9 billion Bluetooth devices in the world today. That number keeps growing. Over the next 2 years, annual Bluetooth device shipments are expected to double from 2 to 4 billion, according to ABI Research.Intel mobile computing engineer Jim Kardach was instrumental in bringing together Ericsson, IBM, Intel, Nokia and Toshiba to form the Bluetooth SIG in 1998. That group created the universal standard that is used by more than 17,000 member companies.Kardach recalls playing the role of instigator and mediator among the founding companies, but says the group quickly agreed on a common goal to create a small, low-power consuming, low-cost, short-range radio with built-in security and the ability to connect ad hoc with other devices. Inspired by a book about Vikings that he was reading at the time, he came up with the Bluetooth name.Just days before he retired in December, Kardach reflected on his 27-year career at Intel, including the genesis of Bluetooth, the many low-power design breakthroughs that led to 100 patents and his work on the first notebook system-on-chip (SoC) sold in the 1980s by Intel called the 386SL/486SL.How did you get involved with the creation of Bluetooth?I got the assignment in 1997 when my boss at the time came up to me and said, Youre finishing up the ACPI stuff, can you figure out how to integrate wireless into the notebook?We got together Ericsson, Nokia, Toshiba and IBM. That probably represented 60 percent of both the cellphone and notebook markets at the time. The key was to define the goals of what we wanted to do. We formed a SIG, all agreeing that we wanted to build this universal, very low-cost, private, wireless cable.We did it under an open IP (intellectual property) policy, allowing us to take the best pieces from everywhere and put them together. We had goals on what we wanted this thing to cost and strategies for it being built on a bulk CMOS process, which hadnt been done before. It had security, privacy and had to work across the world, so we picked the ISM band, which required fixing some of the regulatory issues around it. We had a term sheet that everyone agreed to and we put it together. Intel became the leader simply because we had IBM and Toshiba who didnt trust each other, and Ericsson and Nokia who didnt trust each other, so we were kind of the Switzerland.How does a chief power architect look at things?The idea for the Bluetooth name came from Jim Kardach of Intel, who was reading a historical novel about Vikings and King Harald Bluetooth at the time.Power is one of the key attributes. Battery life is life. Its the life of the product. To ignore that is totally unacceptable. You have to design things to work efficiently, but more importantly, do nothing efficiently. Those are the two rules of power management.We rely on architectural designs to lower power use. We design chips to turn things off and back on only when theyre needed. We architect things to minimize latency and anticipate when something is needed so it gets turned on just in time.We used to rely on randomness, like when you drive to work and hope to miss all of the red lights, but more recently weve purposely tried to line up activities in order to create big idle gaps between these activities. If the idle gaps are long enough, we can shut off all of the power. For example, we now have special offloading accelerators that run to do specialized media loads and then be able to put the rest of the platform to a low-power state, which means 98 percent of it is powered off.Hardware not designed for power management can be like crying babies that wake up the whole house. They ping memory every couple of milliseconds or microseconds, keeping the CPU out of its low-power state. This can keep memory and the busses between them alive. A Bluetooth radio should require about a milliwatt of power, but when you put it on a USB plug, because of the way the bus was architected, it generates an extra 6 watts of power by pinging memory every millisecond. These are things we want to catch up front when architecting for good power management.The fourth-generation Intel Core processors that use an SoC design are coming out soon. Whats the advantage of SoCs over traditional CPU designs?SoC allows you to do things that arent possible if you have a handful of chips from different venders. We have the advantage of doing our own chipsets and CPUs, which allows us to design power management between them and the rest of the platform.In the 1980s I worked on the 3SL and 4SL SoCs. We were doing it in an era where we were cramming hundreds of thousands of transistors on a die and now we can fit billions. We can now take advantage of Moores Law and increased capacity that were getting from bigger wafers and smaller transistors. This lets us integrate more capabilities into a small chip. Having an SoC allows us to bring power management across the platform.With the 3SL, we added new operating modes to the CPU that pulled some power management underneath the operating system. This work is still used today. To design an SoC, sometimes you have to trade off time to market but you can really take advantage of them to manage power consumption.This content was originally published on the Intel Free Press website.'	1.0

They show a teacher demonstrating how to use a strap-on sex toy in a number of different positions.In one image, the teacher even shows how to insert the strap-on while her buttocks are in the air and her legs up over her head.In another image, the woman shows the children how to wear a harness to which the strap-on is attached.Clinton Middle School in Duval County hired 39-year-old Sharon Mercer to teach the sex education class but after the photos emerged she was suspended and the school refused further comment. Mercer claimed her suspension was an act of “bigotry” because she was a “proud member of the LGBTQ community.”Newly implemented Common Core educational standards have been assailed for their attempt to create a lowest common denominator form of teaching which many assert only works to dumb down lessons and prevent smart students from excelling.The teaching of so-called “alternative” sexual lifestyles is being practiced in many states under Common Core as a result of sexual content finding its way into other subjects. A school district in Arizona banned a Common Core-approved book last year after it was found to contain sexually explicit passages that described scenes of bondage.Common Core, which is being federally imposed on states across the nation, is a huge shift in teaching which opponents assert will eviscerate critical thinking and generally lower standards in the name of inclusiveness and political correctness. Numerous examples have emerged of Common Core style exam questions which only serve to cause more confusion and frustration.Perhaps the most infamous example of how Common Core will manifest itself in America’s schooling system was illustrated by a bizarre video in which a Common Core curriculum director said that 3 x 4 = 11 could be considered a correct answer so long as students could explain how they reached that number.Common Core’s sex education content has also faced fierce criticism, with one group even claiming that it represents “pornography” which serves to desensitize children to sexual contact and could lead to an increased chance of molestation within the schooling system.Common Core approved book aimed at 11th graders contains sexually explicit scenes of bondage.“What is taught includes teaching inappropriate sexuality skills, that shouldn’t even be taught in college,” writes Joseph R. John . “According to child psychologists, the children are not mentally equipped to understand the detailed sexual indoctrination starting in kindergarten, they are indoctrinated in sexual practices that they should never be exposed to.”“There is a heavy socio political content of sex throughout Common Core curriculum being taught in every grade and in every subject, the student is taught that there is a sameness of gender, there is no longer simply boys and girls according to Common Core,” notes John. “The sexual content of Common Core crosses into every curriculum taught, from teaching sexuality skills in sex education courses by specially skilled and trained sex education teachers. Sexual activities and content in included in every subject taught. Sex is taught in the English curriculum, is included in the language curriculum, sex is woven into the science curriculum, in the math curriculum, in the social studies curriculum, and of course in biology.”As the backlash grows, more and more states are considering abolishing Common Core altogether, with Indiana’s decision earlier this year to ditch the program seen as a victory for conservatives.FOLLOW Paul Joseph Watson @ https://twitter.com/PrisonPlanet*********************Paul Joseph Watson is the editor at large of Infowars.com and Prison Planet.com .  Print this page.	1.0

The area is known to be the home of several gators, although there have been few cases of anyone receiving serious injuries from gator attacks in the area. That said, approaching a wild gator to take a photo is definitely not recommended.“I’ve lived in Pensacola all my life,” said one witness, who was walking her dogs along the trail, “but never have I seen anyone take such a big risk, and for so little.” According to the witness, the New Zealand tourist, who is yet to be formally named, deviated from the trail despite being warned by several locals that the gator may attack. “She risked her life to take a photo with a gator? It’s madness, why would you do a thing like that?”Numerous onlookers were horrified as the woman approached a gator that was resting on the edge of the trail in a patch of sun. “I pleaded with her to get back onto the trail,” said one male witness, “but she said she was just going to take a selfie and told me not to worry about it.” The woman proceeded to take out her phone and prepare for the selfie, but moments later the alligator lashed out, covering the distance between itself and the tourist in seconds.Related Articles23 Women Inappropriately Dressed For Walmart?These content links are provided by Content.ad .

We saw the gator grab her between his jaws, and there was a sharp cry as he dragged her into the bushes, and then just a strange stillness.” The authorities were summoned almost immediately but nothing could be done. “A few hours later we found a purse which we believe belonged to the victim, but no sign of her body has been found.”The identity of the New Zealand woman who perished in the attack has not yet been revealed, although it is believed she was visiting relatives in Pensacola. Authorities have reminded tourists to the region to not take any risks and be aware of the dangers posed by alligators. “For some visitors who are unfamiliar with the strength and speed of these animals, they may be complacent and not appreciate how dangerous they can be. We want to urge tourists to take precautions, and don’t risk your life over getting a photo with an alligator, as it might just kill you.”In other news making headlines, a 29-year old Alabama woman has been hailed as a hero after she was able to fight off a man during an attempted rape. However, her story has sparked some controversy after it emerged that she cut off the rapist's genitals and forced him to eat them.Popular Stories"	1.0

His decision comes after a shooting at a high school in nearby Parkland, Fla. left 17 dead and others injured.Courtesy of Ben DickmannBen Dickmann has been hunting since he was a child. The 40-year-old Florida man enjoyed going out on the gun range to practice firing at targets and was the proud owner of an AR-57, a semi-automatic rifle.But, after 17 people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School by a former student using a semi-automatic rifle, Dickmann, who lives just over 30 minutes away in Fort Lauderdale, did something unexpected.Dickmann turned in his AR-57 to the sheriff's office and asked them to destroy it. He posted about it on Facebook, and that post has now gone viral. It's been shared more than 100,000 times.Dickmann spoke to NPR's Michel Martin about his love of the firearm and why he decided to give it up.Interview HighlightsOn the decision to turn in his AR-57It's come after a lot of soul searching. Everybody always says - you know, it's the big argument right now - everybody's offering thoughts and prayers but nothing else. And I thought, well, this is something I can do that I think is right. And it's something I can do that might spark a change. You know, my whole goal was maybe to inspire one friend on my Facebook page to do the same thing. And maybe that friend would inspire one other person. And who knows? I totally didn't expect for this to go the way it did and as fast as it did.On the issue of obtaining a concealed carry/weapon permitThe concealed weapons permit program here in the state of Florida, as far as I'm concerned, is a joke. Literally, it's three hours of PowerPoint, and then you go down to the range with a very, very low caliber handgun, and you have to put five out of 10 rounds on a paper plate at 5 feet. Probably half the class that I had are people that had never touched a gun before in their life.On the challenge to give up his AR-57After Las Vegas, I had thought long and hard about it, and thought, well, you know, it's not hurting anything sitting in my gun safe here. But it wasn't really until this last tragedy at Stoneman Douglas where it really hit home with us - and me.Actually, one of my friends on Facebook rather sarcastically said, well, if you really feel this way, why don't you go turn in your gun at Broward Sheriff's Office? I'll even drive you. And that's what spurred me to think. Even though he was being extremely sarcastic about it because he's a very staunch conservative, gun rights activist person, it kind of spurred me to say, you know what? Yeah, I'll do that.On what he plans to do nextFor me, to be honest, I'm not sure. It's a lot to process, and nothing that I had this grand master plan going into this for. So I'm happy that this sparked a debate and hopefully causes some action. I hope somebody - be it the students, be it the next generation - picks up the torch and does something.NPR's Digital News intern Asia Simone Burns produced this story for the Web.

https://www.snopes.com/amelia-bassano-william-shakespeare/	Amelia Bassano: The True Shakespeare?	false	['amelia bassano', ' bassano', ' literature', ' sonnets', ' william shakespeare', ' william shakespeare plays']	http://njjewishnews.com/	http://njjewishnews.com/njjn.com/022808/ltKosherBard.html	2015/08/20	Special to the NJJNFebruary 28, 2008John Hudson is a man with a mission. Seven years ago, the 54-year-old social theorist embarked on a literary adventure, following a long-nursed hunch about Shakespeare’s true identity.Hudson had spent most of his adult life grappling with complex questions that straddled the fields of social theory and cognitive science, creating high-level strategic redesign for the energy, telecommunications, Internet, and public sectors.“Most of my work involved helping media companies rethink their industries,” says Hudson. “Now I’ve moved on to rethinking the Shakespearean industry.” With his life and plays comprising a billion-dollar global industry, says Hudson, the Bard has managed to secure a sublime place in literary history as well as an omnipresence in pop culture and media. “But, like all industries, it rests on certain assumptions,” says Hudson. It is these very assumptions — primarily about who the author of the plays really was — that Hudson set about to reinvent.Hudson had an uneasy feeling that there was more beneath the plays’ surface than was brought to light by scholars and historians. His search began in earnest after he enrolled in a postgraduate program at the Shakespeare Institute at the University of Birmingham — in Stratford-upon-Avon, naturally — where he spent four years delving into the texts.He gradually devised the latest approach to Shakespearean authorship, the Amelia Bassano Theory — recently recognized by the Shakespearean Authorship Trust as one of the top eight authorship theories.The figure of Amelia Bassano Lanyer had turned up before in Shakespearean scholarship. In 1973, celebrated historian A.L. Rowse identified her as the actual “Dark Lady” of Shakespeare’s famed sonnets. Bassano — known as the first woman in England to have published a book of original poetry (Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum, 1611), which has been interpreted as an early feminist critique of the Christian Gospels — was part of a family of Italian court musicians of Moroccan/Semitic ancestry who lived as clandestine Jews.Hudson explains that the unusual circumstances of Amelia’s upbringing accounted for her extraordinary education and literary sensitivity. By age seven, she was adopted by the Countess of Kent, who provided her with a well-rounded education, including studies in Greek, Latin, and the Bible. By 13, she became mistress to Lord Henry Hunsdon, the man in charge of the English theater and patron of the Lord Chamberlain’s Men — the company that performed Shakespeare’s works.The plays certainly suggest that their author had access to scholarly training as well as exposure to certain specific environments — all of which coincide with Amelia’s biography. The 2,000 musical references, for example, were her birthright; the hundreds of references to plants, law, military life, and falconry could likely be the result of her involvement with Hunsdon. Other subject matter in the plays echoes her childhood experiences.But most important, Hudson discovered her key “literary signatures” — in which Amelia left her name spread across various plays. Her married name Lanier — meaning falcon in French — is spread across the two different versions of The Taming of the Shrew. It is in the form of the central figure who is tamed like a falcon, together with her name Emila; her father’s name, Baptista, and her husband’s name, Alphonso. An Emillius and a Bassianus appear in Titus Andronicus as well. But the most important “signatures” are those created after her husband’s death, between 1622-23, when her full maiden name — Aemilia Johnson Willough(by) Bassanio — was spread across three Shakespearean plays, associated in each case with the standard image of the Renaissance poet. Such a circumstance had little chance of being a mere coincidence. “She so badly wanted us to notice them,” says Hudson, “but nobody ever did.”Something revolutionaryThe next step for Hudson was to bring his case to the theater-going public. The first play he selected as a vehicle for his theory was A Midsummer Night’s Dream; with its staging he intended to present the allegorical plot revealing the key subtextual layers indicative of Bassano’s Jewish authorship. The challenge was to find the right people to do the job and convince them that he was on to something revolutionary.Hudson is British, married to an American, and the couple often shuttles between London and New York. It was there, in the fall of 2006, that he set out to put together a theater group that had both the dramatic training and mental muscle to actualize his theories. After a few months, Hudson had on board Mahayana Landowne, a Yale Drama School-educated director. Next he enrolled in a “Shakespeare Boot Camp” workshop at the New Perspectives Theatre Company, where he befriended Jenny Greeman, an experienced actress and theater educator who was to become his assistant director. “I found his theory compelling,” said Greeman, “and the figure of Amelia Bassano is absolutely fascinating…. She is someone who needs to be spoken about much more. I am thoroughly ready to believe that she could have written these plays….”Translating Hudson’s esoteric theory into concepts and then into practice involved hours of improvisation between actors, directors, and dramaturge (Hudson’s official title). “I was happy to adopt a hands-off management style when it came to staging the plays and leave it to those who truly understood the physicality of the theater,” he said. Yet, when it came to selecting actors for his new troupe, The Dark Lady Players, he made a point of meeting extensively with each actor to ensure that they were willing to think about the plays allegorically and took a proactive role at the dramatic workshops.Lila Dupree, who played Theseus, feels that the DLP achieved a group dynamic unlike any she had experienced before. “It is definitely a struggle at times to condense things so that they will be visually clear and clean. With something this high-concept, you risk alienating the audience, so a lot of our process involves finding ways to break down that fourth wall, so to speak.”Dupree is one of about 15 actors in the troupe, representing an eclectic ‘melting pot’ of theatrical backgrounds. What they all share is Shakespearean training buttressed by a voracious appetite for intellectually rigorous work.The DLP is now testing its version of As You Like It in workshops. Also in the pipeline is Hudson’s biography of Amelia Bassano, as well as a documentary film deal. With all the exciting attention on the horizon, the troupe feels wholly committed to its mission of presenting new and thought-provoking interpretations of Shakespeare’s (or Bassano’s) plays. “We’ve learned a lot from our experience with Midsummer,” says Dupree, “and with As You Like It, we are ready to take it to the next level.”To order a DVD of the Dark Lady Players’ Midsummer Night’s Dream, e-mail Dark Lady Players .Daniela Amini is a New York-based freelance writer specializing in theater, opera, dance, and local news.Comedy as revengeIn staging Midsummer Night’s Dream, John Hudson’s objective was, first and foremost, to reveal the play as a Jewish satire rife with pointed references to Christian idolatry. In other words, “comedy as revenge.”John Hudson carried out a literary adventure and brought it to the stage.In his findings, each character is revealed to have a connection with a character in religious allegory, i.e., a “double” in the Roman/Christian world. Stanford University professor Patricia Parker had already shown that Puck carries the name of two devils, that Bottom represents Jesus (and, in the course of the play, undergoes a kind of “Passion”), and that Thisbe represents the Church. Hudson completed the puzzle to show that Oberon is the figure of Yahweh (God of the Jews), who is embroiled in the Jewish-Roman war against Titus Caesar (embodied by Titania) over the abduction of the true Jewish Messiah (the Iudean or ‘Indian’ boy); the “flower, love in idleness” (a pun on idolatry), represents the Gospels; and the end of the play is a Jewish apocalypse characterized by the distribution of dew — as in the Zohar.The Dark Lady Players debuted Midsummer Night’s Dream in March 2007 at the Abingdon Theatre Arts Complex near Times Square. The staging was never heavy-handed and there were some uproariously funny moments, punctuated by scenes of violent carnage and deep, spiritual pathos. The overall tone was of a promising marriage between strict comedy and strict tragedy.— DANIELA AMINIDark Lady eventsFrom the Dark Lady Players’ A Midsummer Night’s Dream: A Comic Jewish Satire, Kirsta Peterson, top, as Bottom/Pyramus and Megan McGrath, left, and Amanda Bruton as soldiers.

Here’s our guide to the best beer and mixed drinks available throughout Disneyland Resort.While it’s not as popular as Drinking Around the World at Epcot in Walt Disney World, leisurely afternoon spent exploring the various Disneyland Resort bars is a lot of fun. Plus, all of these bars are within a short walk of one another given Disneyland’s condensed footprint, so it’s easy to hit them all in one day.Some of the mixed drinks here might be off-menu at some locations, but they’re listed because the bartenders at the given location do a great job with these drinks. We try to give a couple suggestions for each location so that you don’t have to order a random drink off what I “lovingly” prefer to as the Generic DisneyParks® Drink Menu® .I loathe this menu of sugar-water and vibrantly color concoctions meant to appeal only to vacationers who don’t regularly drink. It is the epitome of what is wrong with the contemporary Disney theme parks: homogenization that has replaced unique experiences in the name of saving a few bucks because bean-counters either don’t understand the “Disney Difference,” or think most guests won’t notice, anyway. More importantly, if you’re someone who has the mental and physical fortitude to partake in a bar crawl, you will be largely unimpressed by these drinks. Plus, consuming more than a couple will make you sick to your stomach from an overdose of sugar.Because of this, we make recommendations that are either unique to each specific stop on our tour, or are drinks most bartenders at the locations in question know how to make. Order these, or order something else you enjoy that the bartender knows how to make. You order drinks off the Generic DisneyParks® Drink Menu® at your own peril.Obviously you should use your head when consuming alcohol. Eat a big early-lunch before you start, make sure to stay hydrated, and spread out your drinking. This is enough fun that it should be an all day event, so take your time. We recommend starting at around noon and concluding late in the evening.Every good bar crawl needs a good name, and we’re fresh out. Epcot has “Drinking Around the World,” which is a very solid name, but nothing spectacular for Disneyland sticks out like that. In lieu of something better, I’m going to call this the Disneyland Drinking Debauchery. Sounds a little more risque than it actually is, but I like alliterations.It’s scientifically proven that the best place to start the Disneyland Drinking Debauchery is in Disney California Adventure. Laugh if you want, but there is a very good reason for this: Disney California Adventure has some attractions that are enhanced with alcohol. Seriously, it’s like adding 3D to the Lion King. It started out great, but 3D really adds an element of “wow.”These alcohol-enhanced attractions are California Screamin’, Silly Symphony Swings, Goofy’s Sky School, and the Golden Zephyr. In other words, the stuff on Paradise Pier. “Science” is needed here because you need to consume the perfect amount of alcohol to enhance these experiences. Drink too little, and they’re the same as they normally are. Drink too much, and it’s Upchuck-City. Population: everyone in your general vicinity. Not a pretty picture. However, if you hit that slightly-buzzed sweet spot, these attractions are a lot more fun.Okay, let’s get started with the fun!Disney California AdventureCarthay Circle Lounge – Part of the all-new Buena Vista Street, Carthay Circle contains a restaurant and two lounges. The first lounge, 1901, is available only to “upgraded” Club 33 members.  The other lounge is where you’ll be stopping, and there’s no reason to be down about this if you’re not a Club 33 member (as is the case with 99.99999999999999999% of the population), because this lounge is spectacular.The decor is classy and elegant, and most importantly, the lounge has its own unique menu. There are several great options on this menu, with different types of custom ice (seriously) to boot! My personal favorite is the Carthay Manhattan. Sarah enjoys the Carthay Club Mojito. The Aviator Cocktail is a good, strong drink, too. Be careful when you step into Carthay Circle Lounge, as this could be the first and last stop on your Disneyland Debauchery Drinking tour. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, as the drinks here are seriously good.Al Fresco Tasting Terrace – This location can be difficult to find. It’s a secluded area upstairs from Wine Country Trattoria. If you can’t find the staircase leading here, ask a Cast Member. It’s easier to find than it used to be, since changing over from the Al Fresco Lounge to the Tasting Terrace. Now featuring more tasting plates and a robust drink menu, things have improved, as you can read in our Al Fresco Tasting Terrace Review .Moreover, the views from this terrace into Cars Land are phenomenal. Here, we recommend one of the cheaper wine flights or the Widmer Hefeweizen . This is a wine bar, so I’d caution against straying from wines and beers. We’ve never had a good mixed drink here. In fact, the Irish Coffee Sarah once ordered here was about the most disgusting thing I’ve ever tasted, and was nothing like a traditional Irish Coffee. Fortunately, Al Fresco Tasting Terrace has come a long way since then, and it’s now one of our favorite spots in DCA.Bayside Brews – Bayside Brews is located near the Silly Symphony Swings, Golden Zephyr, and Goofy’s Sky School. Unsurprisingly, it serves beer. Although it’s just a little stand (if we stopped at every little beer kiosk in DCA, you’d end up in the hospital–fear not, this is one of only two that we hit), it is notable because it serves good beer as compared to other beer stands in Disneyland. We recommend grabbing a Sierra Nevada Torpedo IPA or whatever the Karl Strauss seasonal beer happens to be. The Torpedo IPA is definitely your best bet, and possibly the best beer you can find at Disneyland Resort.We highly recommend grabbing your brew from Bayside Brews, and then heading over to the actual bayside, to the secluded seating area under Silly Symphony Swings. Enjoy your beer there in peace while looking out over the water, and then head upstairs for the ride of your life on the swings!Cove Bar – The next stop is Cove Bar. Ahh, Cove Bar. In the original version of this Drinking Guide that we published in 2012, we regaled readers with tales of Cove Bar and its glorious Lobster Nachos. Prior to that post, we never had to wait to be seated at Cove Bar, always walking up and having our choice of seats.Shortly after that post, Cove Bar exploded in popularity. Now, we aren’t taking credit for that…nor are we taking blame. Irrespective of the reason, Cove Bar exploded in popularity, and a contributing factor was undoubtedly viral images of Lobster Nachos and colorful drinks on Instagram and Pinterest.Cove Bar began drawing lines rivaling those of Radiator Springs Races. The Lobster Nacho Revolution had begun. Fortunately, in early 2016, Disney opened an expanded seating area for Cove Bar, and now the waits have been reduced to more manageable times on most days (10-20 minutes).The bartenders are usually very entertaining and fun at the Cove Bar, so sitting at the bar can also be a good time. This should be your second food stop of the day (you should’ve eaten lunch before commencing the Disneyland Drinking Debauchery) and there is one thing you should absolutely order here: the Lobster Nachos. As we wrote in our Cove Bar Review , the Lobster Nachos are “a zen-like experience that makes you feel like there are little angels massaging your taste buds and tickling your stomach…a religious experience.”These are the most expensive thing on the bar menu, but they are so, so delicious. My drink of choice here is the Zombie , which can be made a few different ways. The bartenders here usually make it a dark green color, but don’t be surprised if it’s light. It does have some fruit juices in it, but it also is heavy on the rum (light, dark, and 151).The Cove Bar also has around 10 beers on tap, so pick one of those if you’re not down with the undead concoction.***Intermission***During the intermission, enjoy the Golden Zephyr, Silly Symphony Swings, and, if your stomach can handle it, California Screamin’ and Goofy’s Sky School. Return to the Disneyland Drinking Debauchery after enjoying these attractions.***Intermission***The Karl Strauss Beer Truck – This beer truck tucked away in Pacific Wharf at Disney California Adventure is our second of two kiosk style stops. As the name suggests, this truck serves Karl Strauss beer. As Disneyland Resort, for some reason, is very lacking on good craft beers, we recommend making a stop here. This should not be read as an endorsement of Karl Strauss beer, but comparatively speaking, it is fairly good. Tower 10 IPA and Red Trolley Ale are both good, or go for the seasonal option. This is one step we’d recommend skipping if you want to drink less and/or don’t care for beer. Alternatively, you can also stop at the nearby Rita’s Baja Blenders, Cocina Cucamonga, or Lucky Fortune Cookie for different options.Flo’s V8 Cafe – The latest addition to our list is quite possibly the best stop of all. If you’ve paced things really slowly, you might be here around sunset. That’s the perfect time to drink at Flo’s! Grab a Racer 5 IPA and head back to the outdoor seating area at the back of the restaurant. Here, you have a perfect view of the Cadillac Mountain Range and Radiator Springs Racers. There’s nothing quite like an early evening enjoying a beer and watching the cars fly by one of Imagineering’s masterpieces. You might just find yourself ending your debauchery here, as you get “stuck” at this spot for a couple of hours. Make no mistake–even though you’re not missing the mission, this is a noble feat.On your way to the next stops at Disney’s Grand Californian Hotel & Spa, pick up FastPasses for (hopefully) the late show of World of Color.Grand CalifornianHearthstone Lounge – Hearthstone Lounge has a pretty good selection of beers, with a lot of the standard choices available elsewhere from Karl Strauss and Sierra Nevada. You can also find some choices from Sam Adams and New Castle, among others, here. Here, we definitely recommend sitting at the bar or at least ordering from the bar. We’ve had inexperienced servers here in the general seating area who simply recommend “any of the good drinks on the menu” with the menu being the Generic DisneyParks® Drink Menu®. I typically opt for a Sierra Nevada here, whereas Sarah usually experiments with whatever “bartender’s choice.” These drinks have always tasted great, but beware, they can pack a punch!Napa Rose – Napa Rose is the best non-club restaurant at Disneyland Resort . It also has a pretty nice bar. Luckily, you don’t have to drop $50 on some filet to grab a beer here (although if you see or smell one, you might find yourself doing just that). I recommend the Franziskaner Hefe-Weisses here. It’s creamy and moderately thick, with a nutty flavor and slight banana undertone to it. Napa Rose is more well known for its world class wine collection, so if you’re into wine, you might go that route. Rather than taking my advice on that, ask the bartender or a server. All of the servers here are sommeliers, meaning they know a heck of a lot more about wine than me!Here, the plan offers some wild-card options. See the below “Other Stops” section if you have time in your crawl and want to make an additional stop.Hollywood Land Dance Party [Insert Name] Club – There is a drink station set-up each night for Mad T Party. It was previously End of Line Club, now it’s “Drink Me.” Who knows what it will be next. Regardless of the name, the idea remains the same: pricey light up drinks for clubin’. While the drinks are fairly expensive (over $10 for the light-up specialties) here to capitalize on the party-oriented audience, ours have always been surprisingly good. This is surprising because, given the location and target, we figured these would be watered-down sugar-drinks. The Glowjito Mojito and Digitini Martini are both good and offer light-up fun. To be fair, they are somewhat sugar-y, but the ones we’ve had (on several different nights) have always had some kick. I don’t know if this is just great luck or if it’s always this way. After grabbing a drink, join the other programs…or…tweedle dums(?) at elecTRONica or Mad T Party . Once the dance party concludes, use your FastPass for the late show of World of Color.Trader Sam’s – Enchanted Tiki Bar – After World of Color, the perfect way to cap off the evening is at the best bar in all of Disneyland Resort, Trader Sam’s. If you want a thorough review of Trader Sam’s, read this review where I offer heaping amounts of praise to Trader Sam’s . The CliffNotes version: Trader Sam’s is the coolest bar in Disneyland, with an intimate (47 person capacity) location that is packed with an astonishing amount of detail, interactive elements, and some fantastic drinks.Some of these drinks include the Adventurers Club Kungaloosh (a Walt Disney World classic), the HippopotoMai-Tai, Shrunken Zombie Head, Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Rum, Shipwreck on the Rocks, and the Uh Oa! The Uh Oa! can be shared by 2-4 people, has a cool tableside presentation, and is our favorite drink at Trader Sam’s. Trader Sam’s does serve some good beers as well, but this is one location where you should stick to mixed drinks because they’re really that good. If you stay for only one drink, you can add items in from the “Other Stops” list below, but we recommend spending a couple hours here soaking up the ambiance and ending your night here. It’s the perfect conclusion to Disneyland Drinking Debauchery.Other Stops – There are other places you can stop, but chances are, even with taking it slow and spreading out the festivities over the course of the entire day, eight stops will be the limit (or even too much) for most people. The stops above are our picks for the best drinking spots in Disneyland. However, since we heavily weigh ambiance, there might be some additional or alternative places that might appeal more to you personally, depending upon your preferences. Here’s our list of the best of the rest:	1.0
https://www.snopes.com/did-a-new-jersey-town-forbid-residents-from-criticizing-islam/	Did a New Jersey Town Forbid Residents From Criticizing Islam?	mfalse	['islamophobia', ' mosque', ' new jersey', ' sharia']	http://americannews.com/	http://americannews.com/us-town-forbids-citizens-criticizing-islam-muslims-residents-furious/	2017/08/08	ago 10According to reports from World Net Daily, a New Jersey township that was sued by a group of Muslims for refusing to approve a massive mosque project is now returning to court because of a settlement agreement that restricts anyone from commenting on “Islam” or “Muslims.”It’s important to note that a key tenet of Shariah bans any negative comments about the religion. According to the Thomas More Law Center who sued the township on behalf of two residents whose home is within 200 feet of the proposed mega-mosque, the settlement “reads more like an instrument of surrender.”The Islamic Society of Basking Ridge won a decision in federal court after its mosque proposal was rejected based on traffic and other concerns. The Township agreed on a $3.5. million payment and a “public hearing to approve the settlement.”Residents Christopher and Loretta Quick challenged the agreement, arguing it restricts speech and violates the Establishment Clause.“The Quicks reside within 200 feet of the proposed mosque construction in a zoned residential area,” Thomas More explained. “Yet, the settlement agreement prohibits them from describing the many unique features of Islamic worship which will impact the design of the building, traffic density, water and sewage, traffic control problems, road construction, and parking arrangements. According to the settlement agreement, ISBR is permitted to make statements concerning Christians and Jews and their places of worship, but in contrast, the agreement prohibits commentary relating to Islam or Muslims. In fact, ISBR has previously discussed the Christian and Jewish religions and their places of worship.”Richard Thompson, chief counsel for Thomas More, said the Islamic center “has taken the extraordinary step of concealing significant links on their website to a radical group named by the federal government as an unindicted co-conspirator in the largest terrorism financing trial in America history, the Islamic Society of North America (‘ISNA’).”Thompson said that while “claiming that the township had a religious animus against Muslims, ISBR hid from the public view its animus toward Christians and Jews, by not only hiding anti-Christian and anti-Semitic verses published on its website but also hiding its significant ties to ISNA. Instead of standing up to defend its citizens against ISBR’s hate-filled anti-Semitic and anti-Christian bias, the township colluded with ISBR’s ‘Civilization Jihad’ by capitulating to payment of millions of dollars to ISBR, allowing the construction of the new mosque and Islamic center in violation“ISBR is setting a dangerous unconstitutional precedent by abusing a court process to chill and trample on the First Amendment rights of private citizens whose only involvement was to speak out against the mosque at public hearings,” Thompson said earlier this year.He asked for the subpoenas to be thrown out “because the U.S. Supreme Court has held that speech at a public place on a matter of public concern is entitled to special protection.”0	1.0

Timothy A. Clary/AFP/GettyShareUpdated | Sure, it's been more than 340 days since Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton, but there's still one very narrow, highly unlikely and entirely unprecedented way that Clinton could become president.But you never know...In light of the ongoing probe into Russia collusion, Harvard University professor Lawrence Lessig posted on  Medium  a series of ""if/then"" scenarios that would lead to House Speaker Paul Ryan handing the White House keys to Clinton.Related: Hillary Clinton losing to Trump was like Jesus's crucifixionTo be clear, constitutional law expert Lessig is not calling for a Clinton ascendancy, but was merely playing out a hypothetical chain of events should a conspiracy be proven:If number 1: If Trump is definitively found to have colluded directly with Russia, he would be forced to resign or be impeached.If number 2: If Trump is removed, Vice President Mike Pence would become president.If number 3: If Pence becomes president, he should resign too, given that he benefited from the same help from Mother Russia.If number 4: If Pence resigns before appointing a vice president, Ryan would become president.If number 5: If Ryan becomes president, he should do the right thing  and choose Clinton for vice president. Then he should resign.""The answer seems unavoidable: He should nominate the person defeated by the treason of his own party, and then step aside and let her become the president,"" Lessig writes. ""Without doubt, if Ryan did the right thing, that would be the most extraordinary event in the history of America since the Confederate Army fired on Fort Sumter. But unlike that, this event would build the union, not divide it.""Lessig, who briefly ran for the Democratic nomination in 2015, adds that Clinton would then appoint Ryan to be veep out of political goodwill. Americans can only assume that while busy being a president who can read policy documents longer than one page , she'd stop her endless press tour and figure out how to keep the nation from getting nuked.Lessig apparently isn't the only one with Clinton on the brain. Clinton has made it clear she won't run for office again, telling CBS Sunday Morning that she's ""done with being a candidate."" But Trump himself tweeted about the possibility Monday.""I was recently asked if Crooked Hillary Clinton is going to run in 2020?"" he wrote . ""My answer was, 'I hope so!'""Only time will tell if the Russia cloud clears up by then.Story was updated to clarify that Lessig was not advocating for the ""if/then"" scenario, but merely laying it out."	1.0

The bodies and money trace back to an armored car robbery in Southeast New Mexico. He had the unit on an autopay contract but his credit card expired and due to a juxtoposed number…he never got the notice in the mail.”According to his secretary, John Lewis Prager, he first he heard of it was when it came over the police scanner in the Mayor’s office. “He suddenly had to go,” said Prager, visibly upset, “It’s the last time I’ve seen or heard from him. I’m guessing he knew what was about to happen and went to some other evil storage locker to cash out and escape.”The FBI thinks Prager is right. Foreman reportedly has more than a dozen storage units spread across Missouri and possibly hundreds around the country. He was spotted on surveillance cameras in Hamilton leaving a unit with a bag from an armored car:A bag that size could contain millions in $100 bills or bearer bonds. The FBI also suspects that Foreman has fake passports and various pre-planned escape routes. “Finding him won’t be easy,” said Slurryman, “but we won’t stop until we do.”The mayor’s job in Goose Rapids will revert to Foreman’s Deputy Mayor.	1.0
https://www.snopes.com/white-house-comment-shutdown/	Did President Trump Shut Down the White House Phone-In Comment Line?	mfalse	['barack obama', ' donald trump', ' white house']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/sN88i	2017/01/24	on January 23, 2017 4:56 pm·In another attempt to stifle freedom of expression, President Trump and his administration have dismantled the White House switchboard comment operating system. Instead, callers will be told to take their complaints and comments to Facebook and other White House social media platforms.When called, the White House switchboard states:“Thank you for calling the White House comments line. The comment line is currently closed but your comment is important to the President and we urge you to send us a comment online at www.WhiteHouse.gov/contact or send us a message through Facebook messenger.”Trump really is becoming the social-media president.Since the end of the transition, when the lines were apparently shut off, the Trump administration has been purging the White House website off all things that generally resemble the Obama White House — and thus anything that has to do with equality and inclusion. So this is just another instance of curtailing the openness of the people’s house.It seems that the 15 percent of American households without internet will not be able to have Trump hear their concerns, who promised to be a champion of all people and listen to their needs.There is no indication yet from the White House whether this is permanent or temporary, as the incoming administration settles into their positions.Still, there was no downtime for this crucial line of democracy when the Obama administration took over in 2009.Given the Trump administration’s penchant for lying and ignoring the people, this should come as no surprise. However, it should worry the public if no future action is taken to address this. The people’s house should be readily available at all times, in all fashions.It’s only day three, and Donald Trump and his team are showing a brazen disregard for the little things that make us great. When studying authoritarians, one must look at how the littlest of things change before their eyes.This might be one of them — a White House that doesn’t want to be bombarded with calls from an outraged public.Featured image by Ron Sachs via Getty ImagesShare this Article!	1.0

https://www.snopes.com/politics/quotes/adhd.asp	Dr. Leon Eisenberg — ADHD Is a ‘Fictitious Disease’?	mtrue	['adhd', ' leon eisenberg']	http://www.bmj.com/	http://www.bmj.com/content/339/bmj.b4615.short	2015/03/14	Ned StaffordTransformed child psychiatry by advocating research into developmental problemsEarly in his medical career, in the mid-1950s, Leon Eisenberg became fascinated with the childhood mind. Wanting to know more, he broke free from the shackles of the Freudian psychoanalytic dogma that dominated child psychiatry at the time to conduct groundbreaking biologically based research of childhood developmental problems. This research included the first randomised clinical drug trials in child psychiatry.“I think what Leon brought to the field was a different way of thinking—thinking out of the box,” said David DeMaso, chairman of psychiatry at Boston Children’s Hospital and professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. “He was thinking in terms of biology, of evidence based treatment, way before anybody else. His was a bio-psycho-social model at a time when psychoanalytical thinking was the norm.”Eisenberg’s direct involvement as a child psychiatry researcher was over by 1967, when he moved to Harvard Medical School as chief of psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital. But in a dozen years he had helped transform the discipline.Beginning in 1952 at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Eisenberg began a fellowship under Leo Kanner, the Austrian born child psychiatrist, who, in the early 1940s, first described autism. In a study of autistic adolescents published in 1956, Eisenberg recognised patterns of language use as the best predictor of prognosis. At the time, many patients who are now are diagnosed as having autism were thought to have mental retardation.He followed that paper with a barrage of papers on attention deficit disorder, learning delays, and other childhood problems. In a study of children otherwise developing normally, Eisenberg found that early reading difficulties increased the chances of later bad behaviour.His most revolutionary study came in 1962, when he launched the first randomised clinical drug trial in child psychiatry. In subsequent drug trials he showed that tranquillising drugs were inferior to placebo in the treatment of anxiety disorders and that stimulant drugs could be effective in controlling hyperactivity. Those studies were the first steps towards ever increasing use of drugs to treat child and adolescent disorders, a development that in recent years concerned Eisenberg.Drug companiesDeMaso, who in the late 1970s became one of Eisenberg’s many protégés, said that Eisenberg thought that many psychiatrists were being influenced by drug companies, adding, “He thought children are now being overdiagnosed with bipolar illness and then overmedicated.”Leon Eisenberg was born in Philadelphia on 8 August 1922, the oldest child of Russian immigrants. His father steered him from the beginning towards medical school. But despite near straight As in college, he was turned down by several medical schools because of his Jewish background. Finally, with help from a Pennsylvania state legislator who his father knew, he was admitted to the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.After graduating in 1946 as valedictorian of his class, he took a rotating intern position at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York city, where he became interested in psychiatry. He served two years as a captain in the US Army Medical Corps and in 1952 moved to Johns Hopkins, becoming chief of child psychiatry in 1961. He held the position until becoming chief of psychiatry in 1967 at Harvard, where his focus shifted to training new generations of researchers.Although Eisenberg has been widely recognised for his childhood research, the Harvard psychiatrist and anthropologist Arthur Kleinman thinks that his contributions from the 1970s onward are as important. Kleinman, a psychiatry resident in the 1970s under Eisenberg, said that he converted the department from a small group of mostly psychoanalysts to a diverse and vibrant national powerhouse that helped shape modern psychiatry. “He made that department,” Kleinman says. “He set the intellectual tone to be highly academic.”In 1968 Eisenberg also became a leading proponent of affirmative action for African Americans and other minorities at Harvard Medical School, guided by his own experiences of discrimination as a Jew in the 1940s.Social sciencesDuring the 1970s, Eisenberg advocated a closer relationship between medicine and the social sciences, which he thought would improve medical care by, as Kleinman put it, “bringing biology together with the social world.” In 1980 Eisenberg became founding chairman of Harvard’s department of social medicine, a position he held until 1991. Eisenberg was the ideal choice to guide the new department, said Kleinman, adding, “He had an omnivorous hunger for knowledge that went across the fields.”Eisenberg was honoured with numerous awards, including the distinguished service award and special presidential commendation from the American Psychiatric Association. He served from 1964 as mental health consultant to the World Health Organization in multiple capacities and was an honorary fellow of the UK Royal College of Psychiatrists.On 1 July this year, the Leon Eisenberg chair in child psychiatry at the Children’s Hospital Boston was officially launched, with DeMaso named as the first holder. Decades after his groundbreaking studies, he still yearned to better understand the childhood mind. “I was eating lunch with him about a year ago, and he told me that more child psychiatry research was needed,” said DeMaso. “He asked me, ‘What are you doing about encouraging your psychiatrists to do more research? They need to do more research. We need more research.’” And DeMaso dutifully followed the advice of his mentor. “We are going to do more research in child psychiatry,” he says. “We are planning to focus on training the next generation of child psychiatry researchers.”Eisenberg leaves his wife, Carola, former dean of students at Harvard Medical School and a cofounder of Physicians for Human Rights, two children from a previous marriage, and two stepsons.NotesCite this as: BMJ 2009;339:b4615Footnotes	1.0

I mean…they live in trailers by the water, right?”Clinton began to laugh but Maddow stopped her:“Madam Secretary, that’s not funny. There are 37 million people in the path of the worst storm our country has seen since Katrina and it will probably do more damage. That was callous and wrong. You’ve been poisoned.

There’s literally no water. The beach and ocean are gone.”He tweeted a follow-up video that showed how the water had retreated at a beach in Long Island, Bahamas.By playing this video you agree to Twitter's use of cookiesThis use may include analytics, personalization, and ads.Download“Basically, Hurricane Irma is so strong and its pressure is so low, it’s sucking water from its surroundings into the core of the storm,” Fritz wrote.“In the center of the storm, where there is extreme low pressure, water is drawn upward. Low pressure is basically a sucking mechanism — it sucks the air into it, and when it’s really low, it can change the shape of the surface of the ocean. As the storm draws water toward the center, it gets pulled away from the surroundings.”Wayne Neely, a forecaster with the Bahamas’ Department of Meteorology, warned residents of Long Island and Exuma, where water had also reportedly receded from the beaches, to be careful as the ocean returned back to high levels.“Care must be taken in this case because the water often returns with even greater fury,” Neely said in a Facebook post explaining the phenomenon.SECURITY WARNING: Please treat the URL above as you would your password and do not share it with anyone.

General MacArthur's Thayer Award Speech -- Duty, Honor, Country (1962)

 The address by General of the Army Douglas MacArthur to the cadets of
the U.S. Military Academy in accepting the Sylvanus Thayer Award on 12 May 1962
is a memorable tribute to the ideals that inspired that great American soldier. For as long as other Americans serve their country as courageously and honorably
as he did, General MacArthur's words will live on. General MacArthur's service to his country spanned  the years from
1903, when he was graduated from the Military Academy, to 5 April 1964 , when he
died in Washington, D.C., at the age of 84. He was recognized early in his
career as a brilliant officer and was advanced to brigadier general in 1918. Twelve years later he was named Chief of Staff of the Army, and in 1937 he
retired. Recalled to active duty during World War II, he was commander of the
Southwest Pacific Area during the greater part of the war. His wartime triumphs
were followed by service as supreme commander of the Allied occupation forces in
Japan. When the Korean conflict erupted, he also commanded the United Nations
forces in Korea. He completed his active military service in 1951. Before being laid to rest in Norfolk, Va., General MacArthur's body lay
in state in New York City and in the Capitol rotunda in Washington, while a
grateful Nation paid its tribute in sorrow. Duty, Honor, Country

 No human being could fail to be deeply moved by such a tribute as this
[Thayer Award]. Coming from a profession I have served so long and a people I
have loved so well, it fills me with an emotion I cannot express. But this
award is not intended primarily to honor a personality, but to symbolize a great
moral code-a code of conduct and chivalry of those who guard this beloved land
of culture and ancient descent. For all hours and for all time, it is an
expression of the ethics of the American soldier. That I should be integrated
in this way with so noble an ideal arouses a sense of pride, and yet of
humility, which will be with me always. Duty, honor, country:  Those three hallowed words reverently dictate what
you ought to be, what you can be, what you will be. They are your rallying
point to build courage when courage seems to fail, to regain faith when there
seems to be little cause for faith, to create hope when hope becomes forlorn. Unhappily, I possess neither that eloquence of diction, that poetry of
imagination, nor that brilliance of metaphor to tell you all that they mean. The unbelievers will say they are but words, but a slogan, but a flamboyant
phrase. Every pedant, every demagogue, every cynic, every hypocrite, every
troublemaker, and, I am sorry to say, some others of an entirely different
character, will try to downgrade them even to the extent of mockery and
ridicule. But these are some of the things they do. They build your basic character. They mold you for your future roles as the custodians of the Nation's defense. They make you strong enough to know when you are weak, and brave enough to face
yourself when you are afraid. What the Words Teach

 They teach you to be proud and unbending in honest failure, but humble and
gentle in success; not to substitute words for actions, not to seek the path of
comfort, but to face the stress and spur of difficulty and challenge; to learn
to stand up in the storm, but to have compassion on those who fall; to master
yourself before you seek to master others; to have a heart that is clean, a goal
that is high; to learn to laugh, yet never forget how to weep; to reach into the
future, yet never neglect the past; to be serious, yet never to take yourself
too seriously; to be modest so that you will remember the simplicity of true
greatness, the open mind of true wisdom, the meekness of true strength. They give you a temperate will, a quality of the imagination, a vigor of
the emotions, a freshness of the deep springs of life, a temperamental
predominance of courage over timidity, of an appetite for adventure over love of
ease. They create in your heart the sense of wonder, the unfailing hope of what
next, and joy and inspiration of life. They teach you in this way to be an
officer and a gentleman. And what sort of soldiers are those you are to lead? Are they reliable? Are they brave? Are they capable of victory? Their story is known to all of you. It is the story of the American
man-at-arms. My estimate of him was formed on the battlefield many, many years
ago, and has never changed. I regarded him then, as I regard him now, as one of
the world's noblest figures; not only as one of the finest military characters,
but also as one of the most stainless. His name and fame are the birthright of every American citizen. In his
youth and strength, his love and loyalty, he gave all that mortality can give. He needs no eulogy from me; or from any other man. He has written his own
history and written it in red on his enemy's breast. But when I think of his patience in adversity of his courage under fire and
of his modesty in victory, I am filled with an emotion of admiration I cannot
put into words. He belongs to history as furnishing one of the greatest
examples of successful patriotism. He belongs to posterity as the instructor of
future generations in the principles of liberty and freedom. He belongs to the
present, to us, by his virtues and by his achievements. Witness to the Fortitude

 In 20 campaigns, on a hundred battlefields, around a thousand camp fires, I
have witnessed that enduring fortitude, that patriotic self-abnegation, and that
invincible determination which have carved his statue in the hearts of his
people. From one end of the world to the other, he has drained deep the chalice of
courage. As I listened to those songs [of the glee club], in memory's eye I
could see those staggering columns of the first World War, bending under soggy
packs on many a weary march, from dripping dusk to drizzling dawn, slogging
ankle deep through the mire of shell-pocked roads to form grimly for the attack,
bule-lipped, covered with sludge and mud, chilled by the wind and rain, driving
home to their objective, and for many to the judgment seat of God. I do not know the dignity of their birth, but I do know the glory of their
death. They died, unquestioning, uncomplaining, with faith in their hearts, and
on their lips the hope that we would go on to victory. Always for them: Duty, honor, country. Always their blood, and sweat, and
tears, as we sought the way and the light and the truth. And 20 years after, on
the other side of the globe, again the filth of murky foxholes, the stench of
ghostly trenches, the slime of dripping dugouts, those boiling suns of
relentless heat, those torrential rains of devastating storms, the loneliness
and utter desolation of jungle trails, the bitterness of long separation from
those they loved and cherished, the deadly pestilence of tropical disease, the
horror of stricken areas of war. Swift and Sure Attack

 Their resolute and determined defense, their swift and sure attack, their
indomitable purpose, their complete and decisive victory - always through the
bloody haze of their last reverberating shot, the vision of gaunt, ghastly men,
reverently following your password of duty, honor, country. The code which those words perpetuate embraces the highest moral law and
will stand the test of any ethics or philosophies ever promulgated for the
things that are right and its restraints are from the things that are wrong. The soldier, above all other men, is required to practice the greatest act of
religious training--sacrifice. In battle, and in the face of danger and death,
he discloses those divine attributes which his Maker gave when He created man in
His own image. No physical courage and no greater strength can take the place
of the divine help which alone can sustain him. However hard the incidents of
war may be, the soldier who is called upon to offer and to give his life for his
country is the noblest development of mankind. You now face a new world, a world of change. The thrust into outer space
of the satellite, spheres, and missiles marks a beginning of another epoch in
the long story of mankind. In the five or more billions of years the scientists
tell us it has taken to form the earth, in the three or more billion years of
development of the human race, there has never been a more abrupt or staggering
evolution. We deal now, not with things of this world alone, but with the illimitable
distances and as yet unfathomed mysteries of the universe. We are reaching out
for a new and boundless frontier. We speak in strange terms of harnessing the
cosmic energy, of making winds and tides work for us, of creating unheard of
synthetic materials to supplement or even replace our old standard basics; to
purify sea water for our drink; of mining ocean floors for new fields of wealth
and food; of disease preventatives to expand life into the hundred of years; of
controlling the weather for a more equitable distribution of heat and cold, of
rain and shine; of spaceships to the moon; of the primary target in war, no
longer limited to the armed forces of an enemy, but instead to include his civil
populations; of ultimate conflict between a united human race and the sinister
forces of some other planetary galaxy; of such dreams and fantasies as to make
life the most exciting of all times. And through all this welter of change and development your mission remains
fixed, determined, inviolable. It is to win our wars. Everything else in your
professional career is but corollary to this vital dedication. All other public
purposes, all other public projects, all other public needs, great or small,
will find others for their accomplishment; but you are the ones who are trained
to fight. The Profession of Arms

 Yours is the profession of arms, the will to win, the sure knowledge that
in war there is no substitute for victory, that if you lose, the Nation will be
destroyed, that the very obsession of your public service must be duty, honor,
country. Others will debate the controversial issues, national and international,
which divide men's minds. But serene, calm, aloof, you stand as the Nation's
war guardian, as its lifeguard from the raging tides of international conflict,
as its gladiator in the arena of battle. For a century and a half you have
defended, guarded, and protected its hallowed traditions of liberty and freedom,
of right and justice. Let civilian voices argue the merits or demerits of our processes of
government:  Whether our strength is being sapped by deficit financing indulged
in too long, by Federal paternalism grown too mighty, by power groups grown too
arrogant, by politics grown too corrupt, by crime grown too rampant, by morals
grown too low, by taxes grown too high, by extremists grown too violent; whether
our personal liberties are as thorough and complete as they should be. These great national problems are not for your professional participation
or military solution. Your guidepost stands out like a ten-fold beacon in the
night:  Duty, honor, country. You are the leaven which binds together the entire fabric of our national
system of defense. From your ranks come the great captains who hold the
Nation's destiny in their hands the moment the war tocsin sounds. The long, gray line has never failed us. Were you to do so, a million
ghosts in olive drab, in brown khaki, in blue and gray, would rise from their
white crosses, thundering those magic words: Duty, honor, country. Prays for Peace

 This does not mean that you are warmongers. On the contrary, the soldier
above all other people prays for peace, for he must suffer and bear the deepest
wounds and scars of war. But always in our ears ring the ominous words of
Plato, that wisest of all philosophers: ""Only the dead have seen the end of
war."" The shadows are lengthening for me. The twilight is here. My days of old
have vanished--tone and tint. They have gone glimmering through the dreams of
things that were. Their memory is one of wondrous beauty, watered by tears and
coaxed and caressed by the smiles of yesterday. I listen vainly, but with
thirsty ear, for the witching melody of faint bugles blowing reveille, of far
drums beating the long roll. In my dreams I hear again the crash of guns, the rattle of musketry, the
strange, mournful mutter of the battlefield. But in the evening of my memory
always I come back to West Point. Always there echoes and re-echoes: Duty,
honor, country. Today marks my final roll call with you. But I want you to know that when
I cross the river, my last conscious thoughts will be of the corps, and the
corps, and the corps. I bid you farewell. The text of this speech is reproduced from Department of Defense

populations; of ultimate conflict between a united human race and the sinister
forces of some other planetary galaxy; of such dreams and fantasies as to make
life the most exciting of all times.  And through all this welter of change and development your mission remains
fixed, determined, inviolable. It is to win our wars. Everything else in your
professional career is but corollary to this vital dedication. All other public
purposes, all other public projects, all other public needs, great or small,
will find others for their accomplishment; but you are the ones who are trained
to fight.  Yours is the profession of arms, the will to win, the sure knowledge that
in war there is no substitute for victory, that if you lose, the Nation will be
destroyed, that the very obsession of your public service must be duty, honor,
country.  Others will debate the controversial issues, national and international,
which divide men's minds. But serene, calm, aloof, you stand as the Nation's
war guardian, as its lifeguard from the raging tides of international conflict,
as its gladiator in the arena of battle. For a century and a half you have
defended, guarded, and protected its hallowed traditions of liberty and freedom,
of right and justice.  Let civilian voices argue the merits or demerits of our processes of
government:  Whether our strength is being sapped by deficit financing indulged
in too long, by Federal paternalism grown too mighty, by power groups grown too
arrogant, by politics grown too corrupt, by crime grown too rampant, by morals
grown too low, by taxes grown too high, by extremists grown too violent; whether
our personal liberties are as thorough and complete as they should be.  These great national problems are not for your professional participation
or military solution. Your guidepost stands out like a ten-fold beacon in the
night:  Duty, honor, country.  You are the leaven which binds together the entire fabric of our national
system of defense. From your ranks come the great captains who hold the
Nation's destiny in their hands the moment the war tocsin sounds.  The long, gray line has never failed us. Were you to do so, a million
ghosts in olive drab, in brown khaki, in blue and gray, would rise from their
white crosses, thundering those magic words: Duty, honor, country.  This does not mean that you are warmongers. On the contrary, the soldier
above all other people prays for peace, for he must suffer and bear the deepest
wounds and scars of war. But always in our ears ring the ominous words of
Plato, that wisest of all philosophers: ""Only the dead have seen the end of
war.""  The shadows are lengthening for me. The twilight is here. My days of old
have vanished--tone and tint. They have gone glimmering through the dreams of
things that were. Their memory is one of wondrous beauty, watered by tears and
coaxed and caressed by the smiles of yesterday. I listen vainly, but with
thirsty ear, for the witching melody of faint bugles blowing reveille, of far
drums beating the long roll.  In my dreams I hear again the crash of guns, the rattle of musketry, the
strange, mournful mutter of the battlefield. But in the evening of my memory
always I come back to West Point. Always there echoes and re-echoes: Duty,
honor, country.  Today marks my final roll call with you. But I want you to know that when
I cross the river, my last conscious thoughts will be of the corps, and the
corps, and the corps."	1.0

Many individuals are incidentally exposed to secondhand cannabis smoke, but little is known about the effects of this exposure. This report examines the physiological, subjective, and behavioral/cognitive effects of secondhand cannabis exposure, and the influence of room ventilation on these effects.MethodsNon-cannabis-using individuals were exposed to secondhand cannabis smoke from six individuals smoking cannabis (11.3% THC) ad libitum in a specially constructed chamber for one hour. Chamber ventilation was experimentally manipulated so that participants were exposed under unventilated conditions or with ventilation at a rate of 11 air exchanges/hour. Physiological, subjective and behavioral/cognitive measures of cannabis exposure assessed after exposure sessions were compared to baseline measures.ResultsExposure to secondhand cannabis smoke under unventilated conditions produced detectable cannabinoid levels in blood and urine, minor increases in heart rate, mild to moderate self-reported sedative drug effects, and impaired performance on the Digit Symbol Substitution Task (DSST). One urine specimen tested positive at using a 50 ng/mL cut-off and several specimens were positive at 20 ng/mL. Exposure under ventilated conditions resulted in much lower blood cannabinoid levels, and did not produce sedative drug effects, impairments in performance, or positive urine screen results.ConclusionsRoom ventilation has a pronounced effect on exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke. Under extreme, unventilated conditions, secondhand cannabis smoke exposure can produce detectable levels of THC in blood and urine, minor physiological and subjective drug effects, and minor impairment on a task requiring psychomotor ability and working memory.Keywords: Cannabis, Marijuana, THC, Exposure, Secondhand, Cognitive1. INTRODUCTIONCannabis is the most widely used illicit drug globally ( World Health Organization, 2014 ). The most popular route of administration is smoking, which often occurs indoors, in automobiles, or in other areas where ventilation is limited or variable. Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major psychoactive component of cannabis, is present in both mainstream smoke (inhaled by the user) and sidestream smoke (dispersed into environment; Cone et al., 1987 ; Fehr and Kalant, 1972 ; Matthais et al., 1997 ). Metabolism of THC yields the psychoactive metabolite, 11-hydroxy-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (11-OH-THC), which is present in blood after active or passive exposure to cannabis smoke ( Huestis et al., 1992 ; Moore et al., 2011 ). THC and 11-OH-THC have similar behavioral effects, but 11-OH-THC levels peak later than THC levels after cannabis exposure ( Hollister and Gillespie, 1975 ; Huestis et al., 1992 ; Järbe et al., 1994 ; Kosersky et al., 1974 ; Lemberger et al., 1973 ). Metabolism of 11-OH-THC yields 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH). THC-COOH is non-psychoactive, but its long half-life (~140 hours) makes it a common biomarker in urine testing for cannabis use.Many individuals are passively exposed to secondhand cannabis smoke given the current prevalence and patterns of cannabis use, however, there has been little controlled research examining the consequences of secondhand exposure. Most research on secondhand cannabis smoke exposure has focused on detection of cannabinoids (e.g., THC, 11-OH-THC, THC-COOH) in various biological matrices. Cone and Johnson (1986) exposed five healthy men to passive smoke from either 4 or 16 cannabis cigarettes (2.8% THC) in a small, enclosed room for one hour each day on six consecutive days. This secondhand smoke exposure reliably produced detectable levels of cannabinoids in urine and plasma, which varied in an orderly relation to dose (i.e., cannabinoid levels were higher after exposure to smoke from 16 cannabis cigarettes vs. 4 cigarettes). Similar results were obtained from studies using comparable designs (i.e., secondhand cannabis smoke exposure in small closed rooms or motor vehicles; Law et al., 1984 ; Mason et al., 1983 ; Mørland et al., 1985 ; Perez-Reyes et al., 1983 ).At least four limitations impede interpretation of these studies with regard to current real-world secondhand cannabis smoke exposure scenarios. First, exposure in these studies always occurred under the “extreme” conditions (i.e., in small spaces without ventilation). Because secondhand cannabis exposure in the real world occurs under conditions with different degrees of air ventilation (e.g., in rooms with air conditioning or open windows, or outdoors), research examining the effects of ventilation on exposure levels is needed. Second, the average potency of “street” cannabis has increased more than 3-fold in the time since these studies were conducted (sinsemilla cannabis seized from 2002–2008 by federal and state law enforcement agencies in the U.S. averaged 11.1% to 11.9% THC; Mehmedic et al., 2010 ). To our knowledge, only one controlled study has examined passive exposure to higher potency cannabis (10.4% THC) that more closely resembles street cannabis available today ( Niedbala et al., 2005 ). A more thorough examination of secondhand exposure using higher potency cannabis is needed to better model passive exposure to today’s cannabis and its potential effects on drug test results. Third, only one study has reported both physiological and subjective effects of secondhand cannabis exposure ( Cone and Johnson, 1986 ). Cone and Johnson (1986) reported that secondhand cannabis exposure had no systematic effects on heart rate or blood pressure, and that participant’s ratings of subjective drug effects increased significantly after exposure to smoke from 16 cannabis cigarettes relative to placebo ratings. These effects were most pronounced during the first hour after exposure, and resolved within three hours. Fourth, no prior studies have evaluated the effects of secondhand cannabis smoke exposure on behavioral/cognitive performance. Expanded research on the effects of secondhand cannabis smoke exposure in the areas outlined above is timely and warranted.The present study was conducted to examine the influence of variations in cannabis potency (5.3% THC vs. 11.3% THC) and in room ventilation (unventilated vs. standard residential ventilation) on the effects of secondhand cannabis smoke exposure. The primary objective of the study was to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of cannabinoids in various biological matrices following secondhand smoke exposure in order to inform federal workplace drug testing standards. A detailed report of the urine cannabinoid concentrations has been previously published ( Cone et al., 2015 ). Here, we report the outcomes of pharmacodynamic assessments, cannabinoid concentrations in whole blood, and provide a brief summary of the urine results. Data analysis was restricted to comparisons of the ventilated vs. unventilated sessions with the same potency of cannabis (11.3% THC) because over 40% more 11.3% THC cannabis was consumed than 5.3% THC cannabis (14.4 grams total vs. 10.2 grams total) in comparable (unventilated) study sessions. The different levels of cannabis consumption between these 2 conditions preclude our ability to validly compare the effects of cannabis potency on study outcomes, particularly pharmacodynamic measures. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate the effect of room ventilation on secondhand cannabis smoke exposure and is among the few secondhand cannabis smoke studies to examine pharmacodynamic outcomes or utilize cannabis with a potency that is representative of current “street” cannabis.2. METHODS2.1. Participants2.1.1. RecruitmentFrequent cannabis users and cannabis nonusers were recruited from the greater Baltimore, MD area via media advertising and word-of-mouth communication. Interested participants completed a screening session to determine eligibility. Participants provided written informed consent during the screening session. The Institutional Review Board at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine approved this study.2.1.2. SmokersCannabis users were eligible to participate as smokers if they: (1) were 18–45 years old, (2) reported using cannabis at least two times per week throughout the past 90 days, (3) provided a urine specimen that was positive for THC-COOH and negative for other drugs of abuse at screening and on the day of each study session, (4) had a negative breath alcohol reading at screening and on the day of each study session, (5) had a body mass index of 19–34 kg/m2, (6) were judged to be in good general heath based on physical examination, and (7) were not pregnant or nursing. Cannabis users were encouraged to participate in all three of the exposure sessions as a means of reducing between-session variability in smoke exposure among nonsmokers. Smokers were instructed to remain abstinent from cannabis overnight prior to exposure sessions.2.1.3. NonsmokersIndividuals who were not current cannabis users were eligible to participate in the study if they: (1) were 18–45 years old, (2) reported cannabis use at least once in their lifetime, but not within the prior 6 months, (3) provided a urine specimen that was negative for drugs of abuse at screening and on the day of study admission, (4) had a negative breath alcohol reading at screening and on the day of participation, (5) had a BMI ranging from 19–34 kg/m2, (6) were judged to be in good general heath based on a full physical examination, and (7) were not pregnant or nursing. Each nonsmoker participated in only one exposure session due to concern that residual effects of cannabis exposure in one session might influence results of subsequent sessions. Because the primary aim of this study was to examine the pharmacokinetic profile of secondhand cannabis smoke exposure, we restricted the nonsmoker group to individuals who were not current cannabis users so that they would not have residual cannabinoids in biological matrices (e.g., urine, saliva) at baseline.2.2. Experimental ProcedureThree secondhand cannabis exposure sessions were conducted at the Johns Hopkins University Bayview campus. The first session involved exposure to cannabis containing 5.3% THC in an unventilated environment, the second session involved exposure to cannabis containing 11.3% THC in an unventilated environment, and the third session involved exposure to cannabis containing 11.3% THC in a ventilated environment. We only describe results from the second and third sessions here.Smokers and non-smokers arrived at approximately 0700 hours on session days. Drug and alcohol testing was conducted upon arrival to confirm that participants still met study eligibility requirements regarding substance use. Smokers were reminded of abstinence requirements the day before each session took place, and study staff met with active smokers when they arrived on session days to check for signs of recent cannabis use (e.g., bloodshot eyes, odor of cannabis smoke) to verify reported abstinence. Nonsmokers were required to urine test negative for cannabis. Nursing staff placed an intravenous catheter in the non-dominant arm of each participant for repeated blood sampling. Tobacco and caffeine use was not permitted during study sessions. One nonsmoker was a daily tobacco user, and was provided with nicotine patches in order to reduce the potential effect of nicotine withdrawal on study outcomes.After completing baseline assessments, 6 cannabis smokers and 6 nonsmokers entered a specially constructed smoke exposure chamber (approximately 0900 hours). The chamber measured 10 ft. × 13 ft. (3.05 m × 3.96 m) with a 7 ft. (2.13 m) ceiling, was constructed using a combination of Plexiglas and aluminum support beams, and incorporated an adjustable ventilation/exhaust system. Smokers and nonsmokers sat around a table in alternating seats. All participants wore protective clothing over their normal clothes (disposable booties, jumpsuits) during the exposure session, and were provided with swimming goggles to prevent eye irritation from accumulated smoke.During the unventilated exposure session, ducts at both the intake and exhaust manifolds of the chamber were capped, eliminating the inflow/outflow of air. During the ventilated session a central air conditioning unit fed cool air through a 9.5 in2 (24 cm2) intake register at one end of the chamber. On the opposite end, air was exhausted through a 9.5 in2 (24 cm2) register into a ventilation shaft that contained a motorized fan. The ventilation system was calibrated to achieve an airflow rate of 11 air-exchanges/hour, which is consistent with residential ventilation standards based on the size of the chamber. Other than the differences in ventilation and select study participants, both session protocols were identical.Each smoker was provided with 10 cannabis cigarettes obtained from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Drug Supply Program and a CReSS Pocket smoking topography device (Borgwaldt KC, Richmond, VA, USA). Each cannabis cigarette contained approximately 1 gram of high potency (11.3% THC) cannabis. The door to the chamber was sealed using magnetic strips around the frame of the door at the start of each 60-minute exposure session. Active smokers were instructed to smoke the provided cannabis cigarettes ad libitum through the CReSS device, which measured the number of puffs taken, puff volume, and other parameters of smoking behavior. Participants were instructed to remain seated for the entirety of the session, but were allowed to engage in leisure activities (e.g., talking, reading, using personal electronic devices, etc.). Research staff monitored the exposure session from outside the chamber to ensure nonsmokers did not actively inhale from the cannabis cigarettes and that smokers only consumed cigarettes from their own supply. Pulse oximeters were used to monitor blood oxygen concentration of study participants every 15 minutes to ensure an adequate oxygen supply was maintained in the chamber.After 60 minutes the door to the exposure chamber was opened; participants then exited the chamber, immediately discarded protective clothing, and washed their hands and face to minimize contamination of biological samples collected after exposure. Participants then proceeded to a large room where they completed study assessments at regular intervals for 8 hours post-exposure among smokers and 34 hours post-exposure among non-smokers.2.3. Assessments2.3.1. Measures of cannabis exposureThe total weight of cannabis cigarettes, including butts and loose plant material, was obtained for each participant prior to and immediately after each session to determine the amount of cannabis combusted. We examined CReSS data on total puff volume to assess temporal characteristics of cannabis consumption. Biological samples (blood, urine, saliva, hair) were obtained for 8-hours post exposure among smokers and for up to 34 hours among nonsmokers. Whole blood specimens (10 mL) were obtained from indwelling venous catheters using grey-top vacutainer blood collection tubes at baseline, immediately after exiting the smoke chamber (Time “0”) and 0.5 (30 minutes), 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 22, 26, 30, and 34 hours after exposure. Spot urine specimens were collected hourly for the first 4 hours and then pooled specimens were obtained for hours 6–8, 8–10, 10–12, 12–22, 22–26, 26–30, and 30–34. Quantitative testing for cannabinoids (THC, 11-OH-THC, THC-COOH) in whole blood was conducted by Immunalysis Corp (Pomona, CA) using LC/MS/MS, with a 0.5 ng/mL limit of quantitation. Urinalysis testing for THC-COOH was performed by Clinical Reference Laboratory (Lenexa, KS) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) with cut-offs of both 20 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL and confirmatory GS/MS with a 0.75 ng/mL limit of quantitation (see Cone et al., 2015 ).2.3.2. Physiological AssessmentsHeart rate (BPM) and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mm/hg) were measured using automated monitors while participants were in the seated position at baseline, immediately after exiting the smoke exposure chamber (Time “0”), and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 22, 26, 30, and 34 hours post-exposure.2.3.3. Self-Report AssessmentsParticipants completed a 15-item Drug Effect Questionnaire (DEQ) to assess subjective ratings of drug effects. Individual items on the DEQ included three ratings of drug effects (“do you feel a drug effect?,” “do you feel a pleasant drug effect?,” “do you feel an unpleasant drug effect?”) and twelve ratings of behavioral/mood states often associated with cannabis intoxication (“sick”, “heart racing”, “anxious”, “relaxed”, “paranoid”, “tired”, “alert”, “irritable”, “vigorous”, “restless”, “hungry/have munchies”, “craving cannabis”). Participants rated each item using a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) anchored with “not at all” on one end and “extremely” on the other. The DEQ was administered at baseline and at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 22, 26, 30, and 34 hours post-exposure.2.3.4. Behavioral/Cognitive AssessmentsParticipants completed three different computerized behavioral tasks to assess aspects of psychomotor/cognitive performance known to be sensitive to the acute effects of smoked cannabis and relevant to functioning in the workplace and/or operating a motor vehicle or heavy machinery ( Hooker and Jones, 1987 ; Wilson et al., 1994 ). Study participants completed each task three times during the screening visit while under the supervision of study staff in order to ensure proper understanding and minimize the influence of practice effects on task performance during the study, and were administered at baseline and at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 hours post-exposure.2.3.4.1. Divided Attention Task (DAT; Casswell and Marks, 1973 )On this task, participants simultaneously tracked a central stimulus and monitored peripheral stimuli. The central stimulus was a diamond that moved back and forth horizontally across the computer screen. Participants were instructed to track this stimulus using the computer mouse while monitoring a target digit at the lower center of the computer screen. Peripheral stimuli were digits (1–9) that appeared in each of the four corners of the screen. Participants were instructed to click the computer mouse once each time one of the digits in the corners of the screen matched the target digit. Task duration was 6 minutes. Primary outcomes on the DAT are the number of correct peripheral targets identified, reaction time (milliseconds) on correct responses, and mean distance (number of pixels) of cursor from the central stimulus.2.3.4.2. Digit Symbol Substitution Task (DSST; McLeod et al., 1982 )On this task, participants viewed a series of nine geometric patterns. Each pattern was numbered (1–9) and consisted of three highlighted squares on a 3×3 grid. When the number associated with a particular pattern appeared on the center of the screen, participants were instructed to replicate the shape of that pattern using the an assigned 3×3 section of the computer keyboard. Task duration was 90 seconds. Primary outcomes of the DSST were total number of trials attempted, total number correct, and percentage of attempted trials completed correctly.2.3.4.3. Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT; Gronwall et al., 1977 )On this task, participants were presented with a string of single digit integers on the computer screen. Participants were instructed to calculate the sum of each successive pair of integers presented and select the correct answer from a list of choices displayed on the screen using the computer mouse. These integers appeared on the screen every 2.8 seconds during the initial battery of 30 trials. Following a 30 second break, integers appeared every 2.4 seconds during the second battery of 60 additional trials. Task duration was 5 minutes. Primary outcomes on the PASAT were total number of trials correct, and reaction time (milliseconds) on correct items.2.4. Data AnalysisDemographic variables were compared between smokers and nonsmokers, and between nonsmokers in unventilated and ventilated sessions using independent-samples t-tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. We limited analyses to the time window when subjective and behavioral/cognitive effects were likely to be observed because of the abundance of zero or near-zero blood cannabinoids levels and subjective drug effect ratings at later post-exposure time points. To select this window, we plotted levels of THC and of 11-OH-THC in whole blood at baseline and during the first four hours post-exposure to examine total intoxicant exposure during the post-exposure timeframe when effects are typically present. Blood cannabinoid levels peaked immediately after exposure and declined to below the level of quantitation by 90 minutes post-exposure among nonsmokers. DEQ ratings of “feel drug effect” appeared to parallel changes in blood cannabinoid levels among both smokers and nonsmokers (see Figure 1 ). Consequently, we limited outcome analyses of physiological, subjective, and behavioral/cognitive effects to the first hour after cannabis exposure.Figure 1Whole blood THC levels, whole blood 11-OH-THC levels, heart rate (BPM) and DEQ visual analog scale ratings (VAS, 0–100) of “feel drug effect” among smokers and nonsmokers in unventilated and ventilated study conditions. Error bars ...We fit mixed effects regression models ( Gueorguieva and Krystal, 2004 ) to assess differences between baseline and the first hour post-exposure for each measure. This model allowed us to compare the mean difference between baseline values and post-exposure values while accounting for (1) within-subject variability among post-exposure time points collected during the first hour after exposure within each session, and (2) between-session variability among baseline measures and post-exposure measures for the five active smokers who completed both exposure sessions. Data from active smokers who participated in multiple sessions were analyzed together and are presented together because their levels of cannabinoid exposure did not significantly differ as a function of room ventilation (see Figure 1 ). The absence of significant effects of cannabis exposure on heart rate among active smokers using mixed effects regression models that included data from the first hour post exposure prompted follow up comparisons between heart rate at baseline and heart rate at Time 0 using a second set of mixed effects regression models in order to examine if any transient effects on heart rate were present in smokers and in nonsmokers. Smokers and nonsmokers were not compared. Data on smokers are presented to serve as a reference for evaluating the levels of biological exposure and corresponding drug effects among nonsmokers. All statistical tests were two-tailed, and significance was determined at p < 0.05.3. RESULTS3.1. ParticipantsTable 1 shows demographics of the nineteen participants (7 smokers and 12 nonsmokers) who completed the high potency (11.3% THC) unventilated and ventilated sessions of the study. Seven smokers were included in analyses because one of the original six participants who completed the unventilated session withdrew from the study and was replaced. There were no significant differences between these groups on any of the variables examined.Demographic characteristics among smokers, nonsmokers in the unventilated session, nonsmokers in the ventilated session. Average grams of cannabis consumed per study session among smokers.3.2. Exposure Session ConditionsSmokers consumed a considerable amount of cannabis in both the unventilated (14.4 grams total) and ventilated (16.5 grams total) exposure sessions. The chamber was visibly very smoky during the unventilated session (became difficult to see through to the opposing wall clearly; see Figure 2 in Cone et al., 2015 ). Cannabis smoke was visible during the ventilated session, but it did not obstruct chamber transparency. CReSS data were available for 10/12 smoking bouts (one CReSS device malfunctioned in the unventilated session and the battery died for one unit during the ventilated session). Data on puff volume indicated that smokers consumed 34% less cannabis during the second 30 minutes of the exposure period than during the first 30 minutes. Participants tolerated both study sessions well, with some complaints of mild eye irritation during the unventilated session, mainly among participants who did not wear or removed their protective eye goggles.3.3. Effects of Cannabis Exposure on Cannabinoid Levels in Blood and Urine3.3.1. SmokersFigure 1 shows mean blood THC levels, blood 11-OH-THC levels, heart rate, and ratings of “feel drug effect” among smokers and nonsmokers at baseline and during the first four hours after exposure. All smokers had detectible levels of THC (mean 4.5 ng/ml) and 11-OH-THC (mean 2.4 ng/ml) at baseline, though all reported overnight abstinence and did not show any evidence of recent cannabis use (e.g., cannabis odor, bloodshot eyes). Blood levels of THC and 11-OH-THC peaked immediately following exposure in both sessions (means of 20.7 ng/ml and 5.6 ng/ml, respectively), and returned to baseline within 4 hours.3.3.2. Nonsmokers3.3.2.1. Unventilated SessionNone of the nonsmokers in the unventilated session had detectable blood cannabinoids at baseline, but all six had detectible levels of THC following secondhand smoke exposure. Levels peaked immediately following exposure (Time 0 mean = 3.2 ng/ml), and remained detectible (>0.5 ng/mL) for 1–3 hours post-exposure. Only one participant had detectible levels of 11-OH-THC following exposure. One urine specimen tested positive in accordance with federal drug testing guidelines (screen with ELISA >50 ng/ml THC-COOH and confirmed with GC/MS >15 ng/ml THC-COOH) 4 hours post-exposure. Using a lower cut-off that is common in some commercial drug testing programs (ELISA >20 ng/ml THC-COOH; GC/MS > 15 ng/mL), 4 of 6 nonsmokers produced urine samples that screened and confirmed positive with a window of detection that ranged from 2 to 22 hours post-exposure.3.3.2.2. Ventilated SessionNone of the nonsmokers in the ventilated session had detectable blood cannabinoids at baseline. Four of the six nonsmokers had detectible levels of blood cannabinoids immediately following exposure. These levels were lower than those observed in the unventilated session (Time 0 mean = 0.7 ng/ml), and were not detectable after Time 0. None of these participants had detectible levels of 11-OH-THC following exposure. No urine samples collected from nonsmokers in the ventilated session screened positive, even using the lower (ELISA >20 ng/ml) cut-off level.3.4. Physiological Effects3.4.1. SmokersTable 2 shows detailed outcomes and results from analyses comparing baseline values to values from the first hour post-exposure for physiological, subjective, and behavioral/cognitive study measures. No significant effects on heart rate were observed using the mixed effects regression model that compared baseline to the first hour post exposure (see Table 2 ). Follow-up analyses that compared baseline heart rate to heart rate at Time 0 indicated no main effect of ventilation condition [beta = 1.21 (SEM = 3.33), p = 0.72], a significant main effect of time, [beta = 10.00 (SEM = 3.20) p = .002), and no ventilation condition by time interaction [beta = −4.83 (SEM = 4.53), p = 0 .29]. These results indicate that heart rate was significantly higher at Time 0 compared with baseline (heart rate increased from 66.8 BPM vs. 76.8 BPM in the unventilated session, and 70.0 BPM vs. 75.2 BPM in the ventilated session following cannabis exposure) and that there was no statistically significantly difference in the effect of time on heart rate between the unventilated and ventilated conditions. A modest but statistically significant reduction in systolic blood pressure was observed after cannabis use among smokers (see Table 2 ). No effect on diastolic blood pressure was observed.Physiological, subjective, and behavioral/cognitive measures among smokers in both sessions, nonsmokers in the unventilated session, and nonsmokers in the ventilated session at the baseline assessment (pre) and the average of assessments during the first ...3.4.2. Nonsmokers3.4.2.1. Unventilated SessionNo significant effect on heart rate was observed with the initial fixed effect regression model comparing baseline heart rate to heart rate during the first hour post exposure (see Table 2 ). Follow up analyses comparing baseline heart rate to heart rate at Time 0 indicated a small, but statistically significant increase in heart rate [65.7 BPM vs. 71.7 BPM, beta = 6.00 (SEM = 2.78) p = 0.03]. There was a non-significant trend toward increased systolic blood pressure following exposure and no effect on diastolic blood pressure (see Table 2 ).3.4.2.2. Ventilated SessionNo significant effects on heart rate or blood pressure were observed (see Table 2 ).3.5. Subjective Effects3.5.1. SmokersRatings of “drug effect,” “pleasant drug effect,” “relaxed,” “vigorous,” and “hungry/have munchies” were significantly higher than baseline during the hour following cannabis exposure. Craving for cannabis was significantly lower than baseline during this period. All of these effects resolved (i.e., returned to baseline) within 4 hours.3.5.2. Nonsmokers3.5.2.1. Unventilated SessionRatings of “drug effect,” “pleasant drug effect,” “tired,” and “hungry/have munchies” were significantly higher than baseline during the hour post exposure. Ratings of “alert” and “vigorous” were significantly lower. These effects resolved within 1.5 hours post exposure.3.5.2.2. Ventilated sessionRatings of “hungry/have munchies” increased significantly from baseline during the first hour post exposure. No other subjective ratings showed significant changes.3.6. Behavioral/Cognitive Effects3.6.1. SmokersAverage cursor distance from target increased significantly from baseline during the first hour post exposure on the DAT, indicating decreased tracking accuracy. Performance did not differ from baseline on any other measures examined.3.6.2. Nonsmokers3.6.2.1. Unventilated sessionThe number of DSST patterns attempted increased significantly from baseline during the hour post-exposure, but the percentage of attempted patterns that were completed correctly decreased significantly. There were no significant changes in total number correct on the DSST or performance on the DAT or PASAT.3.6.2.2. Ventilated sessionThe number of DSST patterns attempted and the number completed correctly increased significantly from baseline during the hour post exposure without a change in percent correct. Total number correct on the PASAT also increased significantly from baseline. Reaction time on the PASAT did not change, nor did performance on the DAT.4. DISCUSSIONThis report describes the first study of which we are aware to examine the influence of room ventilation on secondhand exposure to cannabis smoke, and the first study to examine the effects of secondhand cannabis smoke exposure on behavioral/cognitive performance. Exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke in an unventilated chamber the size of a small room produced minor increases in heart rate, mild to moderate subjective drug effects, and minor, but detectible, levels of performance impairment on some behavioral/cognitive assessments. The time course of these effects paralleled the levels of psychoactive cannabinoids in blood and was followed by detectable levels of THC-COOH in urine. The THC-COOH concentration in one specimen was sufficient to trigger a positive urine drug screen at a cut-off of >50 ng/ml (i.e., the cut-off recommended for use by the SAMHSA mandatory guidelines for federal workplace drug testing programs), and multiple positive urine results were observed for four participants using a more stringent cut-off of >20 ng/ml, which is used by some commercial/private workplace drug testing programs, within a day of exposure. Ventilating the exposure chamber in a manner that approximated standard residential heating or air conditioning units dramatically reduced levels of exposure among nonsmokers, evidenced by much lower (in some cases undetectable) levels of cannabinoids in blood and urine and the absence of subjective and behavioral/cognitive effects.We observed some notable patterns in subjective drug effects. First, the effects reported by nonsmokers in the unventilated condition were small in magnitude and predominantly sedative in nature (increased ratings of “tired” decreased ratings of “alert” and “vigorous”). In contrast, the subjective effects reported by active smokers were larger in magnitude and not exclusively sedative (increases in both “relaxed” and “vigorous”). Differential effects after smoking high-potency cannabis (9.75% and 23.12% THC) have been reported elsewhere in the literature (e.g., decreases in both “alertness” and in “calmness”; Hunault et al., 2014 ). Second, although absolute levels were low, the rise and fall of blood cannabinoid levels observed in nonsmokers following exposure in the unventilated condition paralleled the time course of subjective effects. Because nonsmokers in the ventilated condition did not report subjective drug effects, it is unlikely that the subjective intoxication reported by nonsmokers after the unventilated session was the result of social contagion, since nonsmoking participants were around equivalently-intoxicated active smokers during both study sessions while assessments were being completed. Furthermore, in a prior study of controlled smoked cannabis in our laboratory, subjective drug effects remained elevated from baseline an hour after exposure, while mean plasma THC levels had returned to baseline (about 7 ng/mL) ( Milman et al., 2014 ; Vandrey et al., 2013 ). Indeed, blood cannabinoid concentrations typically peak immediately after inhalation and degrade rapidly, and do not necessarily reflect levels of intoxication (see Hollister et al., 1981 ). However, the influence of expectancy effects resulting from the smokiness of the chamber in the unventilated session was not controlled for, may have affected results, and should be considered when interpreting these outcomes.Nonsmokers in the ventilated session did not have detectable levels of cannabinoids in blood beyond the initial 30 minutes following the exposure period, did not screen positive on urine tests, and did not report significant increases in subjective drug effects except for “hungry/have munchies.” Because this increase did not correspond with any other ratings of drug effect, we interpret the increase in hunger as unrelated to cannabis exposure (lunch hour was approaching). These findings suggest that ventilation dramatically reduces secondhand smoke exposure, even when large quantities of cannabis (~16.5 grams) are smoked in relatively small spaces in a short amount of time. Although room ventilation reduced levels of exposure among nonsmokers, ventilation appeared to have very little effect on levels of cannabinoids in blood or subjective effects among smokers. Smokers consumed an average of 2.6 grams of cannabis each through active smoking, thus, the comparatively small amounts of THC absorbed passively by smokers in the unventilated condition were likely not sufficient to produce additional effects.The finding that exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke under extreme unventilated conditions can produce minor, but detectible impairments in performance on a task that measures psychomotor ability and working memory is novel. Passive exposure increased speed of responding but decreased accuracy, reflecting speed-accuracy trade-offs that are consistent with the effects of THC on behavioral/cognitive performance observed among infrequent cannabis users (e.g., Curran et al., 2002 ). In addition, individuals in the ventilated session showed post-exposure increases in both speed and accuracy on the DSST, and increases in accuracy on the PASAT. The lack of such practice effects among individuals in the unventilated condition may be further evidence of impaired performance, but that cannot be determined with confidence based on the design and small sample size of the present study.Interestingly, although smokers consumed large quantities of cannabis, had increased blood cannabinoid levels, and reported moderate to high levels of subjective effects, the expected increase in heart rate commonly associated with cannabis use was relatively small and only very minor signs of decreased performance on one measure of behavioral/cognitive performance (i.e., the DAT) were observed. This may reflect pharmacodynamic tolerance, as all of the active smokers were chronic heavy cannabis users. It is also possible that larger effects on heart rate and performance were missed. Smokers consumed cannabis over a 60-minute time period, and consumed 34% less cannabis during the second 30 minutes of the exposure period than during the first 30 minutes. Thus, it is possible that more robust physiological changes occurred and smokers were impaired during the exposure period, but this impairment resolved prior to post-exposure testing. The effects of cannabis smoking on heart rate may resolve within 45 minutes of smoking ( Vandrey et al., 2013 ; Cooper and Haney, 2014 ), and heart rate was assessed 30, 60, and 90 minutes after many of the active smokers had ceased intensive smoking. The fact that significant differences in heart rate were observed among smokers when comparing baseline to Time 0, but not when comparing baseline to the first hour post exposure suggests that any effects on heart rate were transient. Although acute THC has been shown to reliably produce cognitive/working memory impairment (see Ranganathan and D’Souza, 2006 for review), many of these studies recruited infrequent or moderate cannabis users. Heavier users may show little if any impairment ( Ramaekers et al., 2009 ). Alternatively, the absence of observed cognitive effects may be the result of acute tolerance within study sessions. Additional research evaluating the effects of cannabis on working memory with infrequent users as smokers utilizing the current study procedure would help with interpretation of these results.The results of this study must be considered in light of its limitations. First, we did not conduct a placebo exposure session (i.e., session where cannabis devoid of THC was smoked), making it impossible to determine whether the subjective and behavioral/cognitive effects observed among active smokers and among nonsmokers in the unventilated session were the result of THC exposure or of expectancy. The design of this study would make a placebo session difficult, as active smokers would likely recognize 0% THC cannabis as placebo during the study session. Thus, it would be unlikely they would smoke sufficient quantities, and likely that they would be vocal about the absence of drug effects during the study session, thereby unblinding nonsmokers. There were a relatively small number of participants in each study session, and all participants were exposed to cannabis smoke and completed assessments simultaneously in the same laboratory room. As a result, it is possible that subjective and behavioral/cognitive effects reported by non-smokers may have been influenced by suggestibility or study demand characteristics. However, the finding that nonsmokers in the ventilated session did not show any drug effects, and that the effects observed among nonsmokers in the unventilated session closely paralleled levels of cannabinoids in blood indicate these effects may be the result of passively-absorbed THC. In addition, the experimental conditions created here do not reflect the full spectrum of secondhand cannabis smoke exposure scenarios that occur outside of the laboratory, and should not be interpreted to reflect normative conditions. This study models two scenarios of acute exposure in an enclosed room. The size of room, amount of cannabis consumed, duration of exposure, and frequency of such exposure are all variables that likely would influence outcomes in the real world. That said, several study participants reported previous secondhand exposure experiences that resembled the unventilated study condition, which indicates our exposure model has some degree of ecological validity. Furthermore, testing the effects of passive exposure among a balanced sample of women and men should be regarded as a strength because it speaks to the generality of our results.In conclusion, this study indicates that absorption of cannabinoids can result from secondhand exposure to cannabis smoke. Room ventilation had a significant impact on the degree of cannabinoid absorption and on resultant pharmacodynamic effects. Nonsmokers exposed under unventilated conditions reported low to moderate levels of sedative drug effects that corresponded with minor impairment in cognitive performance, while nonsmokers exposed under ventilated conditions reported no significant subjective effects and did not have impairment in cognitive performance. These results suggest that extreme conditions like those examined in this study may result in biological exposure sufficient to produce measureable subjective effects, decreases in behavioral/cognitive performance, and could produce a positive drug test result within a short window of time following exposure.​Exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke results in absorption of cannabinoids.Secondhand exposure can produce mild subjective and behavioral/cognitive effectsRoom ventilation ameliorates the effects of secondhand cannabis smoke exposure.AcknowledgmentsRole of Funding SourceFunding for this project was provided by SAMHSA.

I am not a doctor or a scientist or a chemist. I just don’t want what happened to my daughter to happen to anyone else.If you have elementary age kids, you are probably familiar with the current slime obsession. My daughter and her friends became obsessed with it a few months ago and couldn’t get enough of it. So much so that they decided they would start making it themselves at home, a simple endeavor providing you have the right ingredients.Basically, homemade slime consists of:BoraxShaving CreamFood Coloring (optional)You might have also heard how stores can’t even keep enough glue in stock. True story… we had a horrible time finding Elmer’s Glue at our local Walmart, Hobby Lobby and Target.There are variations of the above for sure, but these ingredients are what my daughter and her friends were using to create their slime.We are a pretty healthy family. We get our flu shots each year and my kids have never had strep or flu or bronchial illnesses. They have never had more than your basic cold that lasted a few days. When my 12 year old got sick, we thought it was the same basic cold. Symptoms were the same: cough, sore throat, stuffy nose. She was also complaining about headaches and general achiness. Assuming her symptoms would be relieved in a few days, we didn’t pay them much mind. Unfortunately, they didn’t go away. At all. Weeks later, we were still left wondering what on earth was going on. To the doctor we went. We had her take a throat culture, check her lungs, and ears and sinuses. She found nothing. Other than your basic cold symptoms, there wasn’t anything wrong with her on the surface.You know how as a parent you just kind of the get the feeling that there is more to something than meets the eye? My husband was actually the one who connected the dots. He told me one night, “Do you think it could have something to do with the slime she’s been making?”It was like a lightbulb went off. It kind of made sense all of a sudden. From that moment, we banned her from making, holding, touching or even looking at that darn slime.The very next day, her headache went away. Her throat didn’t hurt anymore. She still had some congestion, but wasn’t coughing. Two days later, the congestion started going away. She was breathing better and talking better. No more achiness.What the what??? Could the homemade slime have been poisoning my daughter?Then this article started to make it around on some of my friends’ Facebook feeds: Schoolyard Slime Craze Risk to Children Says Experts .So I started to investigate a little more about what on earth my child was getting into. What I found out was disturbing.BORAX – From the website, CQ Concepts :Boric acid, sodium borate, and sodium perborate are estimated to have a fatal dose from 0.1 to 0.5g/kg. These substances are toxic to all cells, and have a slow excretion rate through the kidneys. Kidney toxicity is the greatest, with liver fatty degeneration, cerebral edema, and gastroenteritis. Boric acid solutions used as an eye wash or on abraded skin are known to be especially toxic to infants, especially after repeated use due to its slow elimination rate.GLUE – From the website, Mediline Plus :Symptoms of breathing in (“sniffing”) glue fumes may include:AnxietyConvulsions (from breathing in large amounts)Drunk, dazed, or dizzy appearanceExcitability	1.0

It truly is a great honor. I’d like to talk today about how to develop a new foreign policy direction for our country, one that replaces randomness with purpose, ideology with strategy, and chaos with peace.TRUMP: It’s time to shake the rust off America’s foreign policy. It’s time to invite new voices and new visions into the fold, something we have to do. The direction I will outline today will also return us to a timeless principle. My foreign policy will always put the interests of the American people and American security above all else. It has to be first. Has to be.That will be the foundation of every single decision that I will make. America…(APPLAUSE)America first will be the major and overriding theme of my administration. But to chart our path forward, we must first briefly take a look back. We have a lot to be proud of.In the 1940s we saved the world. The greatest generation beat back the Nazis and Japanese imperialists. Then we saved the world again. This time, from totalitarianism and communism. The Cold War lasted for decades but, guess what, we won and we won big. Democrats and Republicans working together got Mr. Gorbachev to heed the words of President Reagan, our great president, when he said, tear down this wall.(APPLAUSE)History will not forget what he did. A very special man and president. Unfortunately, after the Cold War our foreign policy veered badly off course. We failed to develop a new vision for a new time. In fact, as time went on, our foreign policy began to make less and less sense. Logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance, which led to one foreign policy disaster after another.They just kept coming and coming. We went from mistakes in Iraq to Egypt to Libya, to President Obama’s line in the sand in Syria. Each of these actions have helped to throw the region into chaos and gave ISIS the space it needs to grow and prosper. Very bad. It all began with a dangerous idea that we could make western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interests in becoming a western democracy.We tore up what institutions they had and then were surprised at what we unleashed. Civil war, religious fanaticism, thousands of Americans and just killed be lives, lives, lives wasted. Horribly wasted. Many trillions of dollars were lost as a result. The vacuum was created that ISIS would fill. Iran, too, would rush in and fill that void much to their really unjust enrichment.They have benefited so much, so sadly, for us. Our foreign policy is a complete and total disaster. No vision. No purpose. No direction. No strategy. Today I want to identify five main weaknesses in our foreign policy.First, our resources are totally over extended. President Obama has weakened our military by weakening our economy. He’s crippled us with wasteful spending, massive debt, low growth, a huge trade deficit and open borders. Our manufacturing trade deficit with the world is now approaching $1 trillion a year.We’re rebuilding other countries while weakening our own. Ending the theft of American jobs will give us resources we need to rebuild our military, which has to happen and regain our financial independence and strength. I am the only person running for the presidency who understands this and this is a serious problem.I’m the only one — believe me, I know them all, I’m the only one who knows how to fix it.(APPLAUSE)Secondly, our allies are not paying their fair share, and I’ve been talking about this recently a lot. Our allies must contribute toward their financial, political, and human costs, have to do it, of our tremendous security burden. But many of them are simply not doing so.TRUMP: They look at the United States as weak and forgiving and feel no obligation to honor their agreements with us. In NATO, for instance, only 4 of 28 other member countries besides America, are spending the minimum required 2 percent of GDP on defense. We have spent trillions of dollars over time on planes, missiles, ships, equipment, building up our military to provide a strong defense for Europe and Asia.The countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense, and if not, the U.S. must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves. We have no choice.(APPLAUSE)The whole world will be safer if our allies do their part to support our common defense and security. A Trump administration will lead a free world that is properly armed and funded, and funded beautifully.Thirdly, our friends are beginning to think they can’t depend on us. We’ve had a president who dislikes our friends and bows to our enemies, something that we’ve never seen before in the history of our country. He negotiated a disastrous deal with Iran, and then we watched them ignore its terms even before the ink was dry. Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon, cannot be allowed. Remember that, cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.(APPLAUSE)And under a Trump administration, will never, ever be allowed to have that nuclear weapon.(APPLAUSE)All of this without even mentioning the humiliation of the United States with Iran’s treatment of our ten captured sailors — so vividly I remember that day. In negotiation, you must be willing to walk. The Iran deal, like so many of our worst agreements, is the result of not being willing to leave the table.When the other side knows you’re not going to walk, it becomes absolutely impossible to win — you just can’t win. At the same time, your friends need to know that you will stick by the agreements that you have with them. You’ve made that agreement, you have to stand by it and the world will be a better place. President Obama gutted our missile defense program and then abandoned our missile defense plans with Poland and the Czech Republic. He supported the ouster of a friendly regime in Egypt that had a longstanding peace treaty with Israel, and then helped bring the Muslim Brotherhood to power in its place.Israel, our great friend and the one true democracy in the Middle East has been snubbed and criticized by an administration that lacks moral clarity. Just a few days ago, Vice President Biden again criticized Israel, a force for justice and peace, for acting as an impatient peace area in the region.President Obama has not been a friend to Israel. He has treated Iran with tender love and care and made it a great power. Iran has, indeed, become a great, great power in just a very short period of time, because of what we’ve done. All of the expense and all at the expense of Israel, our allies in the region and very importantly, the United States itself.We’ve picked fights with our oldest friends, and now they’re starting to look elsewhere for help. Remember that. Not good.Fourth, our rivals no longer respect us. In fact, they’re just as confused as our allies, but in an even bigger problem is they don’t take us seriously anymore. The truth is they don’t respect us. When President Obama landed in Cuba on Air Force One, to leader was there, nobody, to greet him.Perhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of Air Force One. Then amazingly, the same thing happened in Saudi Arabia. It’s called no respect. Absolutely no respect.TRUMP: Do you remember when the president made a long and expensive trip to Copenhagen, Denmark, to get the Olympics for our country, and after this unprecedented effort, it was announced that the United States came in fourth — fourth place? The president of the United States making this trip — unprecedented — comes in fourth place. He should have known the result before making such an embarrassing commitment. We were laughed at all over the world, as we have been many, many times.The list of humiliations go on and on and on. President Obama watches helplessly as North Korea increases its aggression and expands further and further with its nuclear reach. Our president has allowed China to continue its economic assault on American jobs and wealth, refusing to enforce trade deals and apply leverage on China necessary to rein in North Korea. We have the leverage. We have the power over China, economic power, and people don’t understand it. And with that economic power, we can rein in and we can get them to do what they have to do with North Korea, which is totally out of control.He has even allowed China to steal government secrets with cyber attacks and engaged in industrial espionage against the United States and its companies. We’ve let our rivals and challengers think they can get away with anything, and they do. They do at will. It always happens. If President Obama’s goal had been to weaken America, he could not have done a better job.Finally, America no longer has a clear understanding of our foreign policy goals. Since the end of the Cold War and the breakup of the Soviet Union, we’ve lacked a coherent foreign policy. One day, we’re bombing Libya and getting rid of a dictator to foster democracy for civilians. The next day, we’re watching the same civilians suffer while that country falls and absolutely falls apart. Lives lost, massive moneys lost. The world is a different place.We’re a humanitarian nation, but the legacy of the Obama-Clinton interventions will be weakness, confusion and disarray, a mess. We’ve made the Middle East more unstable and chaotic than ever before. We left Christians subject to intense persecution and even genocide.(APPLAUSE)We have done nothing to help the Christians, nothing, and we should always be ashamed for that, for that lack of action. Our actions in Iraq, Libya and Syria have helped unleash ISIS, and we’re in a war against radical Islam, but President Obama won’t even name the enemy, and unless you name the enemy, you will never ever solve the problem.(APPLAUSE)Hillary Clinton also refuses to say the words radical Islam, even as she pushes for a massive increase in refugees coming into our country. After Secretary Clinton’s failed intervention in Libya, Islamic terrorists in Benghazi took down our consulate and killed our ambassador and three brave Americans. Then, instead of taking charge that night, Hillary Clinton decided to go home and sleep. Incredible.Clinton blames it all on a video, an excuse that was a total lie, proven to be absolutely a total lie. Our ambassador was murdered and our secretary of state misled the nation. And, by the way, she was not awake to take that call at 3 o’clock in the morning. And now ISIS is making millions and millions of dollars a week selling Libya oil. And you know what? We don’t blockade, we don’t bomb, we don’t do anything about it. It’s almost as if our country doesn’t even know what’s happening, which could be a fact and could be true.TRUMP: This will all change when I become president.To our friends and allies, I say America is going to be strong again. America is going to be reliable again. It’s going to be a great and reliable ally again. It’s going to be a friend again. We’re going to finally have a coherent foreign policy based upon American interests and the shared interests of our allies.(APPLAUSE)We’re getting out of the nation-building business and instead focusing on creating stability in the world. Our moments of greatest strength came when politics ended at the water’s edge. We need a new rational American foreign policy, informed by the best minds and supported by both parties, and it will be by both parties — Democrats, Republicans, independents, everybody, as well as by our close allies.This is how we won the Cold War and it’s how we will win our new future struggles, which may be many, which may be complex, but we will win if I become president.(APPLAUSE)First, we need a long-term plan to halt the spread and reach of radical Islam. Containing the spread of radical Islam must be a major foreign policy goal of the United States and indeed the world. Events may require the use of military force, but it’s also a philosophical struggle, like our long struggle in the Cold War.In this, we’re going to be working very closely with our allies in the Muslim world, all of which are at risk from radical Islamic violence, attacks and everything else. It is a dangerous world, more dangerous now than it has ever been.We should work — thank you.(APPLAUSE)We should work together with any nation in the region that is threatened by the rise of radical Islam. But this has to be a two-way street. They must also be good to us. Remember that. They have to be good to us, no longer one way. It’s now two-way. And remember, us and all we’re doing, they have to appreciate what we’ve done to them. We’re going to help, but they have to appreciate what we’ve done for them. The struggle against radical Islam also takes place in our homeland. There are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism. For every case known to the public, there are dozens and dozens more. We must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies. We have no idea where these people are coming from. There’s no documentation. There’s no paperwork. There’s nothing. We have to be smart. We have to be vigilant.A pause for reassessment will help us to prevent the next San Bernardino or frankly, much worse. All you have to do is look at the World Trade Center and September 11th, one of the great catastrophes, in my opinion, the single greatest military catastrophe in the history of our country; worse than Pearl Harbor because you take a look at what’s happened, and citizens were attacked, as opposed to the military being attacked — one of the true great catastrophes.And then there’s ISIS. I have a simple message for them. Their days are numbered. I won’t tell them where and I won’t tell them how. We must…(APPLAUSE)… we must as a nation be more unpredictable. We are totally predictable. We tell everything. We’re sending troops. We tell them. We’re sending something else. We have a news conference. We have to be unpredictable. And we have to be unpredictable starting now.But they’re going to be gone. ISIS will be gone if I’m elected president. And they’ll be gone quickly. They will be gone very, very quickly.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Secondly, we have to rebuild our military and our economy. The Russians and Chinese have rapidly expanded their military capability, but look at what’s happened to us. Our nuclear weapons arsenal, our ultimate deterrent, has been allowed to atrophy and is desperately in need of modernization and renewal. And it has to happen immediately. Our active duty armed forces have shrunk from 2 million in 1991 to about 1.3 million today. The Navy has shrunk from over 500 ships to 272 ships during this same period of time. The Air Force is about one-third smaller than 1991. Pilots flying B-52s in combat missions today. These planes are older than virtually everybody in this room.And what are we doing about this? President Obama has proposed a 2017 defense budget that in real dollars, cuts nearly 25 percent from what we were spending in 2011. Our military is depleted and we’re asking our generals and military leaders to worry about global warming.We will spend what we need to rebuild our military. It is the cheapest, single investment we can make. We will develop, build and purchase the best equipment known to mankind. Our military dominance must be unquestioned, and I mean unquestioned, by anybody and everybody.But we will look for savings and spend our money wisely. In this time of mounting debt, right now we have so much debt that nobody even knows how to address the problem. But I do. No one dollar can be wasted. Not one single dollar can we waste. We’re also going to have to change our trade, immigration and economic policies to make our economy strong again. And to put Americans first again.This will ensure that our own workers, right here in America, get the jobs and higher pay that will grow our tax revenues, increase our economic might as a nation, make us strong financially again. So, so important. We need to think smart about areas where our technological superiority, and nobody comes close, gives us an edge.This includes 3D printing, artificial intelligence and cyber warfare. A great country also takes care of its warriors. Our commitment to them is absolute, and I mean absolute. A trump administration will give our servicemen and women the best equipment and support in the world when they serve and where they serve. And the best care in the world when they return as veterans and they come back home to civilian life. Our veterans…(APPLAUSE)Our veterans have not been treated fairly or justly. These are our great people and we must treat them fairly. We must even treat them really, really well and that will happen under the Trump administration.(APPLAUSE)Finally, we must develop a foreign policy based on American interests. Businesses do not succeed when they lose sight of their core interests and neither do countries. Look at what happened in the 1990s. Our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania — and this was a horrible time for us — were attacked. and 17 brave sailors were killed on the USS Cole.And what did we do? It seemed we put more effort into adding China into the World Trade organization, which has been a total disaster for the United States. Frankly, we spent more time on that than we did in stopping Al Qaida. We even had an opportunity to take out Osama bin Laden and we didn’t do itAnd then we got hit at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Again, the worst attack on our country in its history. Our foreign policy goals must be based on America’s core national security interests. And the following will be my priorities.In the Middle East our goals must be, and I mean must be, to defeat terrorists and promote regional stability, not radical change. We need to be clear sighted about the groups that will never be anything other than enemies. And believe me, we have groups that no matter what you do, they will be the enemy.TRUMP: We have to be smart enough to recognize who those groups are, who those people are, and not help them. And we must only be generous to those that prove they are indeed our friends.(APPLAUSE)We desire to live peacefully and in friendship with Russia and China. We have serious differences with these two nations, and must regard them with open eyes, but we are not bound to be adversaries. We should seek common ground based on shared interests.Russia, for instance, has also seen the horror of Islamic terrorism. I believe an easing of tensions, and improved relations with Russia from a position of strength only is possible, absolutely possible. Common sense says this cycle, this horrible cycle of hostility must end and ideally will end soon. Good for both countries.Some say the Russians won’t be reasonable. I intend to find out. If we can’t make a deal under my administration, a deal that’s great — not good, great — for America, but also good for Russia, then we will quickly walk from the table. It’s as simple as that. We’re going to find out.Fixing our relations with China is another important step — and really toward creating an even more prosperous period of time. China respects strength and by letting them take advantage of us economically, which they are doing like never before, we have lost all of their respect.We have a massive trade deficit with China, a deficit that we have to find a way quickly, and I mean quickly, to balance. A strong and smart America is an America that will find a better friend in China, better than we have right now. Look at what China is doing in the South China Sea. They’re not supposed to be doing it.No respect for this country or this president. We can both benefit or we can both go our separate ways. If need be, that’s what’s going to have to happen.After I’m elected president, I will also call for a summit with our NATO allies and a separate summit with our Asian allies. In these summits, we will not only discuss a rebalancing of financial commitments, but take a fresh look at how we can adopt new strategies for tackling our common challenges. For instance, we will discuss how we can upgrade NATO’s outdated mission and structure, grown out of the Cold War to confront our shared challenges, including migration and Islamic terrorism.(APPLAUSE)I will not hesitate to deploy military force when there is no alternative. But if America fights, it must only fight to win.(APPLAUSE)I will never sent our finest into battle unless necessary, and I mean absolutely necessary, and will only do so if we have a plan for victory with a capital V.(APPLAUSE)Our goal is peace and prosperity, not war and destruction. The best way to achieve those goals is through a disciplined, deliberate and consistent foreign policy. With President Obama and Secretary Clinton we’ve had the exact opposite — a reckless, rudderless and aimless foreign policy, one that has blazed the path of destruction in its wake.After losing thousands of lives and spending trillions of dollars, we are in far worst shape in the Middle East than ever, ever before. I challenge anyone to explain the strategic foreign policy vision of Obama/Clinton. It has been a complete and total disaster.I will also be prepared to deploy America’s economic resources. Financial leverage and sanctions can be very, very persuasive, but we need to use them selectively and with total determination.TRUMP: Our power will be used if others do not play by the rules. In other words, if they do not treat us fairly. Our friends and enemies must know that if I draw a line in the sand, I will enforce that line in the sand. Believe me.(APPLAUSE)However, unlike other candidates for the presidency, war and aggression will not be my first instinct. You cannot have a foreign policy without diplomacy. A superpower understands that caution and restraint are really truly signs of strength. Although not in government service, I was totally against the war in Iraq, very proudly, saying for many years that it would destabilize the Middle East. Sadly, I was correct, and the biggest beneficiary has been has been Iran, who is systematically taking over Iraq and gaining access to their very rich oil reserves, something it has wanted to do for decades.And now, to top it off, we have ISIS. My goal is to establish a foreign policy that will endure for several generations. That’s why I also look and have to look for talented experts with approaches and practical ideas, rather than surrounding myself with those who have perfect resumes but very little to brag about except responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at war. We have to look to new people.(APPLAUSE)We have to look to new people because many of the old people frankly don’t know what they’re doing, even though they may look awfully good writing in the New York Times or being watched on television.Finally, I will work with our allies to reinvigorate Western values and institutions. Instead of trying to spread universal values that not everybody shares or wants, we should understand that strengthening and promoting Western civilization and its accomplishments will do more to inspire positive reforms around the world than military interventions.(APPLAUSE)These are my goals as president. I will seek a foreign policy that all Americans, whatever their party, can support, so important, and which our friends and allies will respect and totally welcome. The world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies, that we are always happy when old enemies become friends and when old friends become allies, that’s what we want. We want them to be our allies.We want the world to be — we want to bring peace to the world. Too much destruction out there, too many destructive weapons. The power of weaponry is the single biggest problem that we have today in the world.To achieve these goals, Americans must have confidence in their country and its leadership. Again, many Americans must wonder why we our politicians seem more interested in defending the borders of foreign countries than in defending their own. Americans…(APPLAUSE)Americans must know that we’re putting the American people first again on trade.(APPLAUSE)So true. On trade, on immigration, on foreign policy. The jobs, incomes and security of the American worker will always be my first priority.(APPLAUSE)No country has ever prospered that failed to put its own interests first. Both our friends and our enemies put their countries above ours and we, while being fair to them, must start doing the same. We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism. The nation-state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony. I am skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring America down and will never enter…(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: And under my administration, we will never enter America into any agreement that reduces our ability to control our own affairs.(APPLAUSE)NAFTA, as an example, has been a total disaster for the United States and has emptied our states — literally emptied our states of our manufacturing and our jobs. And I’ve just gotten to see it. I’ve toured Pennsylvania. I’ve toured New York. I’ve toured so many of the states. They have been cleaned out. Their manufacturing is gone.Never again, only the reverse — and I have to say this strongly — never again; only the reverse will happen. We will keep our jobs and bring in new ones. There will be consequences for the companies that leave the United States only to exploit it later. They fire the people. They take advantage of the United States. There will be consequences for those companies. Never again.Under a Trump administration, no American citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second to the citizens of a foreign country.(APPLAUSE)I will view as president the world through the clear lens of American interests. I will be America’s greatest defender and most loyal champion. We will not apologize for becoming successful again, but will instead embrace the unique heritage that makes us who we are.The world is most peaceful and most prosperous when America is strongest. America will continue and continue forever to play the role of peacemaker. We will always help save lives and indeed humanity itself, but to play the role, we must make America strong again.(APPLAUSE)And always — always, always, we must make, and we have to look at it from every angle, and we have no choice, we must make America respected again. We must make America truly wealthy again. And we must — we have to and we will make America great again. And if we do that — and if we do that, perhaps this century can be the most peaceful and prosperous the world has ever, ever known. Thank you very much, everybody. I appreciate it. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)	1.0

https://www.snopes.com/david-clarke-military-medals/	Does Sheriff David Clarke Wear ‘Fake’ Military Medals?	false	['david clarke', ' donald trump', ' outrage', ' salon', ' stolen valor']	http://americannewsx.com/	http://americannewsx.com/hot-off-the-press/another-unqualified-bigoted-fraud-joining-440s-cabinet-sheriff-david-clarke/	2017/05/23	May 21, 2017 Laura Keeling Gun Violence , News , Op/Ed , Politics , Racism 0Sheriff Clarke, self-declared Trump appointee, brings more plagiarism and less valorTrump advocate, controversial Milwaukee County Sheriff, David Clarke, announced on Wednesday that he has been appointed as an  Assistant Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.  Though, there has been no corroboration of his appointment, as of yet, from the White House. As we’ve observed from previous appointments, Trump requires neither qualifications, experience nor training in the specific field, only undying loyalty to him. In the area of undying loyalty, Clarke excels. In the arena of qualifications and experience, he leaves much to be desired.In fact, CNN reported today that the sheriff had plagiarized portions of his Master’s thesis on US security. In fact, there were 47 incidents in his thesis of direct quotes from sources being included in his text without quotation marks. Clarke had been awarded the degree from the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. He is not the first of Trump’s cabinet picks to have had plagiarism troubles, either, but the fourth . In his short tenure, Betsy DeVos, Neil Gorsuch, Monica Crowley and even Trump’s wife have all been accused of plagiarism.The specific position for which Clarke is reportedly being considered is Assistant Secretary in the Office of Partnership and Engagement where his primary function will be “to serve as liaison with state, local and tribal law enforcement and governments.” This is a position for which Clarke is uniquely unqualified. He’s a staunch conservative who’s made no bones about his intense dislike of Liberals/Democrats saying :“The only time I’d only reach across the aisle to a Democrat is to grab them by the throat.”This is not the attitude of a person who will be open to listening and considering different or opposing ideas or positions. What type of relationship does Trump think Clarke will have with Democrats or even moderate Republicans with this hard-line stance? Or does Trump even know what the position requirements are? Knowing Trump, probably not. Trump apparently thinks he’s “diversifying his cabinet.” It’s the diversity of ideas that’s important, not diversity in skin color.Clarke, like his hero Trump, is also impulsive. He, too, shoots from the hip spewing fact-free rhetoric from questionable sources or making claims that have already been debunked. His attacks on Black Lives Matter have been copious, vitriolic and unrelenting, but rarely based on facts.Following the shooting of two police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge, he claimed that America was at war and that BLM was the enemy. However, the police chiefs in both cities had, after conducting a thorough investigation, publicly stated that neither perpetrator had been associated with Black Lives Matter. What the shooters did have in common was that both were ex-military, Afghan war veterans . It’s much more like likely that both were suffering from untreated PTSD than anything else. But, that doesn’t fit Sheriff Clarke’s hate-filled rhetoric, so he ignored it. Or, perhaps he never even considered PTSD as an option since he, like Trump, has never served in the military. Which brings me to my final point.Stolen Valor:2/ Look at this fucking guy's uniform. You see all that shit pinned all over his dress uniform jacket? That's not supposed to be there. pic.twitter.com/0QZlBxQjI8— Charles Clymer (@cmclymer) May 17, 2017Clarke loves posing with his chest full of medals except they’re neither military nor law enforcement. They have more in common with Army/Navy Store designer decorations for the chicken hawk out to impress the gullible than any sort of service. Several veterans have called him on this blatant attempt at passing himself off as a military hero. Just as he’s not a military hero, he’s not a law enforcement hero either if deaths within the jails you oversee is a measure. Four inmates died in the Milwaukee county jails in 2016. One from being denied water for 7 days.Clarke is also the subject of several lawsuits, as covered by Snopes.com, many stemming from unnecessary deaths under his watch. He also favors attacking the press if they dare report the truth about him. You can see why Trump would want him in his cabinet, though the White House does seem to be casting doubt on the appointment that Clarke is claiming:DHS has not confirmed that Clarke has been offered a position with the department. On 17 May 2017, the department’s official Twitter account posted :[Senior] positions are announced when made official by the [Secretary]. No such announcement w/ regard to the Office of Public Engagement has been made.Clarke is an uncaring, unfeeling, unyielding, uncompromising, old fashioned misogynist who embarrasses himself with his inability to adapt to changing times, situations or updated facts. Put it all together, a perfect fit for the Trump administration.	1.0

(Michael Desmond / CBS)Even thoughhas evidently canceled ""Mike & Molly,"" network brass has decided the topic is off-limits.But that's not stopping unhappy cast members from sounding off.Rondi Reed, the veteran stage actress who plays the tough mother to Chicago cop Mike Biggs (Billy Gardell), reported in a Facebook  post last week that ""Mike & Molly"" will come to an end with season 6, which will air early next year. Shooting on the sitcom will finish in late January, she wrote, and only 13 episodes will be completed rather than the 22 originally ordered.""The network has its reasons, and I will not get into a debate, discussion, or campaign to get them to change their minds,"" Reed wrote, adding that executive producerChuck Lorreand studio Warner Bros. Television tried to find another home for the show but had no luck.""It is a fact and we have known for a few weeks,"" Reed wrote. Indeed, Gardell tweeted on Dec. 3 that fans would soon see ""our last episodes,"" although the tweet did not make the same splash that Reed's post did.Melissa McCarthy, the film star who plays Mike's wife, ex-teacher Molly Flynn,  tweeted Monday that she was ""shocked and heartbroken"" when CBS canceled the show.Ratings for ""Mike & Molly"" have tapered since season 1, although not alarmingly so. Season 5 averaged a still-respectable 9.9 million total viewers in live + same day viewing, according to Nielsen. However, production costs rise substantially the longer a show is on the air, partly because of prenegotiated cast salary increases. That's why even modestly falling ratings can spell the end for an aging show.Typically in a case like this, the network would announce the show's termination well in advance of the final episode, giving the cast members and creators plenty of time to ruminate in the media and take a victory lap before the series finale.But CBS has apparently decided that's not happening this time. Network spokespersons had no comment to the cast's posts and tweets. CBS would not even confirm that the show is ending.Why not? That will have to remain open to speculation, unless Reed or someone else wants to start discussing things.What do you think of ""Mike & Molly"" ending its run?Twitter:  @scottcollinsLATALSO:"	1.0
https://www.snopes.com/politics/sexuality/doping.asp	Is ‘Abortion Doping’ a Real Practice?	unverified	['moral outrage', ' olympics']	https://www.nytimes.com/	https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/sports/olympics/russia-doping-olympics.html?_r=0	2017/12/11	Bring on the comeuppance. The remaining big question, with the I.O.C.’s beleaguered president Thomas Bach expected to make an announcement on Tuesday, is whether there should be any Russian athletes in Pyeongchang. Should some be allowed to compete as individuals without any of the nationalistic trappings after proving they are subject to strict drug-testing regimens? Richard Pound, the senior I.O.C. member, thinks not. “I think it has gone too far, and the government shows no contrition or recognition regarding the established facts,” Pound said in an email message on Saturday. With Russian leader Vladimir V. Putin having suggested that he would resist sending athletes to compete as neutrals, Pound thinks the message from the I.O.C. “The I.O.C. needs to take control of the situation, rather than allow the Russians to pre-empt it by walking away,” Pound said. A 75-year-old Canadian tax lawyer and former Olympic swimmer, Pound has been one of the key figures in the fight to make Russia accountable. He was chairman of the World Anti-Doping Agency commission that first confirmed the scale of Russian cheating in track and field in November 2015 in the wake of a report by the German television network ARD. “It’s worse than we thought,” Pound said then before also making it clear that he hoped the Russians would take the hint, make the necessary institutional and cultural changes and not be banned from the upcoming Olympics. A blanket ban could generate legal appeals. For Pound to advocate such a penalty represents a significant hardening in his position. And though he is the only I.O.C. member to have taken this stance publicly, one suspects Bach and many of his lieutenants were feeling rather embittered themselves as they listened to Vitaly Mutko last week. Mutko, the former Russian sports minister now in charge of organizing the FIFA World Cup in Russia in 2018, engaged in a filibuster devoted to denial at a FIFA news conference in which he lashed out at the I.O.C. and others and continued to reject the notion of state involvement in Russian doping. If this was contrition, it certainly did not sound like it. Nor does it help that Mutko, one of the alleged overseers of the doping effort in Sochi, actually got a promotion after those Games and is now deputy prime minister. But more earnest attempts at kowtowing could be forthcoming, perhaps even a rapid marginalization of Mutko, which the I.O.C. would likely perceive as too little too late. For now, the lobbying is accelerating. Yevgenia Medvedeva, the Russian who has dominated women’s figure skating since the Sochi Games, is expected to give a speech to the I.O.C. executive board as part of the Russian delegation to Tuesday’s meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland. Medvedeva would be one of the main attractions in Pyeongchang if allowed to compete. Meanwhile, the leaders of three international winter sports federations — ice hockey, luge and curling — have made it clear that they do not support a blanket ban on Russian athletes in Pyeongchang.

The trouble is that in Russia’s situation, individual clemency would seem more a case of not sanctioning the few for the actions of the many. The numbers are stunning, and they continue to tick upward. The I.O.C. has now retroactively banned 25 Russians who competed in the Sochi Games for doping offenses, stripping 11 medals, and it is not over yet. As of Sunday, 99 Russians had been disqualified from all past Olympics: more than three times the total of any other nation. Collective punishment already applies in other instances in sports. Consider relay team members who are stripped of medals because of a teammate’s doping violation; or athletes who have been forced to comply with their nation’s Olympic boycotts. There have been plenty of lost generations for both just causes and more dubious causes. In Pound’s veteran view (he has been an I.O.C. member since 1978), the Russian situation has much in common with the I.O.C. banning South Africa — and all of its athletes — from the Olympics from 1964 through 1988 because of the nation’s segregationist apartheid policies. “At a certain point, everyone in Russia is part of the corrupted system and must suffer the consequences of such involvement,” Pound said. “The I.O.C. The I.O.C. already has missed one opportunity to send an unmistakably strong message to Russia and the athletes it has defrauded: declining to ban the Russian team from last year’s Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Instead the I.O.C., citing the need to complete its own investigations, left it up to individual federations to make the call. Track and field’s governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations, was the only one that banned the Russian team, although it did allow one Russian athlete, long jumper Darya Klishina, to take part as an independent athlete because she had been based outside of Russia and was subject to extensive international antidoping controls. With Russia still banned from track and field this year, Klishina was part of a delegation of 19 authorized neutral athletes who competed in the world championships in London in August. That presumably would be the template if the I.O.C. does the expected and allows independent Russian athletes but no Russian team in Pyeongchang. It would be, as it was in London, an odd arrangement: muted celebrations, laps of honor without flags, the Olympic anthem on the podium. But in Russia and elsewhere, the medals won by neutrals would still be perceived as Russian medals. That is if Putin allowed neutrals to compete: something he has said would be “humiliation for the country” and something he is presumably not eager to accept with Russian presidential elections coming in March. “You probably cannot divorce this issue from the dynamics and politics of the presidential election,” said Michael Payne, the global sports consultant and former I.O.C. marketing director. But Bach and the I.O.C. can no longer be concerned with Russian politics or Putin’s credibility at this very late stage in the Games. The future of their own organization and their own credibility is too much at stake. Based on what they and we now know, the I.O.C. must, at the very least, ban Russia from Pyeongchang. Don’t be shocked if it follows Pound’s advice and bans the Russians, too.

All fully operational and ready to receive prisoners. They are all staffed and even surrounded by full-time guards. But they are all empty. These camps are to be operated by FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) should Martial Law need to be implemented in the United States and all it would take is a presidential signature on a proclamation and the attorney general’s signature on a warrant to which a list of names is attached. Ask yourself if you really want to be on THE list.The Rex 84 Program was established on the reasoning that if a “mass exodus” of illegal aliens crossed the Mexican/US border, they would be quickly rounded up and detained in detention centers by FEMA. Rex 84 allowed many military bases to be closed down and to be turned into prisons. Operation Cable Splicer and Garden Plot are the two sub programs which will be implemented once the Rex 84 program is initiated for its proper purpose. Garden Plot is the program to control the population. Cable Splicer is the program for an orderly takeover of the state and local governments by the federal government. FEMA is the executive arm of the coming police state and thus will head up all operations. The Presidential Executive Orders already listed on the Federal Register also are part of the legal framework for this operation.The camps all have railroad facilities as well as roads leading to and from the detention facilities. Many also have an airport nearby. The majority of the camps can house a population of 20,000 prisoners. Currently, the largest of these facilities is just outside of Fairbanks, Alaska. The Alaskan facility is a massive mental health facility and can hold approximately 2 million people. Now let’s review the justification for any actions taken. Executive Orders associated with FEMA that would suspend the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. These Executive Orders have been on record for nearly 30 years and could be enacted by the stroke of a Presidential pen:EXECUTIVE ORDER 10990 allows the government to take over all modes of transportation and control of highways and seaports.EXECUTIVE ORDER 10995 allows the government to seize and control the communication media.EXECUTIVE ORDER 10997 allows the government to take over all electrical power, gas, petroleum, fuels and minerals.EXECUTIVE ORDER 10998 allows the government to seize all means of transportation, including personal cars, trucks or vehicles of any kind and total control over all highways, seaports, and waterways.EXECUTIVE ORDER 10999 allows the government to take over all food resources and farms.EXECUTIVE ORDER 11000 allows the government to mobilize civilians into work brigades under government supervision.EXECUTIVE ORDER 11001 allows the government to take over all health, education and welfare functions.EXECUTIVE ORDER 11002 designates the Postmaster General to operate a national registration of all persons.EXECUTIVE ORDER 11003 allows the government to take over all airports and aircraft, including commercial aircraft.EXECUTIVE ORDER 11004 allows the Housing and Finance Authority to relocate communities, build new housing with public funds, designate areas to be abandoned, and establish new locations for populations.EXECUTIVE ORDER 11005 allows the government to take over railroads, inland waterways and public storage facilities.EXECUTIVE ORDER 11051 specifies the responsibility of the Office of Emergency Planning and gives authorization to put all Executive Orders into effect in times of increased international tensions and economic or financial crisis.EXECUTIVE ORDER 11310 grants authority to the Department of Justice to enforce the plans set out in Executive Orders, to institute industrial support, to establish judicial and legislative liaison, to control all aliens, to operate penal and correctional institutions, and to advise and assist the President.EXECUTIVE ORDER 11049 assigns emergency preparedness function to federal departments and agencies, consolidating 21 operative Executive Orders issued over a fifteen year period.EXECUTIVE ORDER 11921 allows the Federal Emergency Preparedness Agency to develop plans to establish control over the mechanisms of production and distribution, of energy sources, wages, salaries, credit and the flow of money in U.S. financial institution in any undefined national emergency. It also provides that when a state of emergency is declared by the President, Congress cannot review the action for six months. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has broad powers in every aspect of the nation. General Frank Salzedo, chief of FEMA’s Civil Security Division stated in a 1983 conference that he saw FEMA’s role as a “new frontier in the protection of individual and governmental leaders from assassination, and of civil and military installations from sabotage and/or attack, as well as prevention of dissident groups from gaining access to U.S. opinion, or a global audience in times of crisis.” FEMA’s powers were consolidated by President Carter to incorporate the National Security Act of 1947 allows for the strategic relocation of industries, services, government and other essential economic activities, and to rationalize the requirements for manpower, resources and production facilities. 1950 Defense Production Act gives the President sweeping powers over all aspects of the economy. Act of August 29, 1916 authorizes the Secretary of the Army, in time of war, to take possession of any transportation system for transporting troops, material, or any other purpose related to the emergency. International Emergency Economic Powers Act enables the President to seize the property of a foreign country or national. These powers were transferred to FEMA in a sweeping consolidation in 1979.If playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.Your browser doesn't support full screen.

https://www.snopes.com/thomas-edisons-mom-lied-about-a-letter-expelling-her-son-from-school/	Thomas Edison’s Mom Lied about a Letter Expelling Her Son from School	mfalse	['']	https://www.nps.gov/	https://www.nps.gov/edis/learn/historyculture/edison-biography.htm	2016/12/01	"Young Thomas Edison.NPS PhotoThomas Alva Edison was born on February 11, 1847 in Milan, Ohio; the seventh and last child of Samuel and Nancy Edison. When Edison was seven his family moved to Port Huron, Michigan. Edison lived here until he struck out on his own at the age of sixteen. Edison had very little formal education as a child, attending school only for a few months. He was taught reading, writing, and arithmetic by his mother, but was always a very curious child and taught himself much by reading on his own. This belief in self-improvement remained throughout his life.Edison began working at an early age, as most boys did at the time. At thirteen he took a job as a newsboy, selling newspapers and candy on the local railroad that ran through Port Huron to Detroit. He seems to have spent much of his free time reading scientific, and technical books, and also had the opportunity at this time to learn how to operate a telegraph. By the time he was sixteen, Edison was proficient enough to work as a telegrapher full time.The development of the telegraph was the first step in the communication revolution, and the telegraph industry expanded rapidly in the second half of the 19th century. This rapid growth gave Edison and others like him a chance to travel, see the country, and gain experience. Edison worked in a number of cities throughout the United States before arriving in Boston in 1868. Here Edison began to change his profession from telegrapher to inventor. He received his first patent on an electric vote recorder, a device intended for use by elected bodies such as Congress to speed the voting process. This invention was a commercial failure. Edison resolved that in the future he would only invent things that he was certain the public would want.Edison moved to New York City in 1869. He continued to work on inventions related to the telegraph, and developed his first successful invention, an improved stock ticker called the ""Universal Stock Printer"". For this and some related inventions Edison was paid $40,000. This gave Edison the money he needed to set up his first small laboratory and manufacturing facility in Newark, New Jersey in 1871. During the next five years, Edison worked in Newark inventing and manufacturing devices that greatly improved the speed and efficiency of the telegraph. He also found to time to get married to Mary Stilwell and start a family.In 1876 Edison sold all his Newark manufacturing concerns and moved his family and staff of assistants to the small village of Menlo Park, twenty-five miles southwest of New York City. Edison established a new facility containing all the equipment necessary to work on any invention. This research and development laboratory was the first of its kind anywhere; the model for later, modern facilities such as Bell Laboratories, this is sometimes considered to be Edison's greatest invention. Here Edison began to change the world. Edison's first phonograph - 1877.NPS PhotoThe first great invention developed by Edison in Menlo Park was the tin foil phonograph. The first machine that could record and reproduce sound created a sensation and brought Edison international fame. Edison toured the country with the tin foil phonograph, and was invited to the White House to demonstrate it to President Rutherford B. Hayes in April 1878.Edison next undertook his greatest challenge, the development of a practical incandescent, electric light. The idea of electric lighting was not new, and a number of people had worked on, and even developed forms of electric lighting. But up to that time, nothing had been developed that was remotely practical for home use. Edison's eventual achievement was inventing not just an incandescent electric light, but also an electric lighting system that contained all the elements necessary to make the incandescent light practical, safe, and economical. After one and a half years of work, success was achieved when an incandescent lamp with a filament of carbonized sewing thread burned for thirteen and a half hours. The first public demonstration of the Edison's incandescent lighting system was in December 1879, when the Menlo Park laboratory complex was electrically lighted. Edison spent the next several years creating the electric industry. In September 1882, the first commercial power station, located on Pearl Street in lower Manhattan, went into operation providing light and power to customers in a one square mile area; the electric age had begun. An early sketch from a laboratory notebook of an electric lightbulb.NPS PhotoThe success of his electric light brought Edison to new heights of fame and wealth, as electricity spread around the world. Edison's various electric companies continued to grow until in 1889 they were brought together to form Edison General Electric. Despite the use of Edison in the company title however, Edison never controlled this company. The tremendous amount of capital needed to develop the incandescent lighting industry had necessitated the involvement of investment bankers such as J.P. Morgan. When Edison General Electric merged with its leading competitor Thompson-Houston in 1892, Edison was dropped from the name, and the company became simply General Electric.This period of success was marred by the death of Edison's wife Mary in 1884. Edison's involvement in the business end of the electric industry had caused Edison to spend less time in Menlo Park. After Mary's death, Edison was there even less, living instead in New York City with his three children. A year later, while vacationing at a friends house in New England, Edison met Mina Miller and fell in love. The couple was married in February 1886 and moved to West Orange, New Jersey where Edison had purchased an estate, Glenmont, for his bride. Thomas Edison lived here with Mina until his death.When Edison moved to West Orange, he was doing experimental work in makeshift facilities in his electric lamp factory in nearby Harrison, New Jersey. A few months after his marriage, however, Edison decided to build a new laboratory in West Orange itself, less than a mile from his home. Edison possessed both the resources and experience by this time to build, ""the best equipped and largest laboratory extant and the facilities superior to any other for rapid and cheap development of an invention "". The new laboratory complex consisting of five buildings opened in November 1887. A three story main laboratory building contained a power plant, machine shops, stock rooms, experimental rooms and a large library. Four smaller one story buildings built perpendicular to the main building contained a physics lab, chemistry lab, metallurgy lab, pattern shop, and chemical storage. The large size of the laboratory not only allowed Edison to work on any sort of project, but also allowed him to work on as many as ten or twenty projects at once. Facilities were added to the laboratory or modified to meet Edison's changing needs as he continued to work in this complex until his death in 1931. Over the years, factories to manufacture Edison inventions were built around the laboratory. The entire laboratory and factory complex eventually covered more than twenty acres and employed 10,000 people at its peak during World War One (1914-1918).After opening the new laboratory, Edison began to work on the phonograph again, having set the project aside to develop the electric light in the late 1870s. By the 1890s, Edison began to manufacture phonographs for both home, and business use. Like the electric light, Edison developed everything needed to have a phonograph work, including records to play, equipment to record the records, and equipment to manufacture the records and the machines. In the process of making the phonograph practical, Edison created the recording industry. The development and improvement of the phonograph was an ongoing project, continuing almost until Edison's death.While working on the phonograph, Edison began working on a device that, ""does for the eye what the phonograph does for the ear"", this was to become motion pictures. Edison first demonstrated motion pictures in 1891, and began commercial production of ""movies"" two years later in a peculiar looking structure, built on the laboratory grounds, known as the Black Maria. Like the electric light and phonograph before it, Edison developed a complete system, developing everything needed to both film and show motion pictures. Edison's initial work in motion pictures was pioneering and original. However, many people became interested in this third new industry Edison created, and worked to further improve on Edison's early motion picture work. There were therefore many contributors to the swift development of motion pictures beyond the early work of Edison. By the late 1890s, a thriving new industry was firmly established, and by 1918 the industry had become so competitive that Edison got out of the movie business all together.The success of the phonograph and motion pictures in the 1890s helped offset the greatest failure of Edison's career. Throughout the decade Edison worked in his laboratory and in the old iron mines of northwestern New Jersey to develop methods of mining iron ore to feed the insatiable demand of the Pennsylvania steel mills. To finance this work, Edison sold all his stock in General Electric. Despite ten years of work and millions of dollars spent on research and development, Edison was never able to make the process commercially practical, and lost all the money he had invested. This would have meant financial ruin had not Edison continued to develop the phonograph and motion pictures at the same time. As it was, Edison entered the new century still financially secure and ready to take on another challenge.Edison's new challenge was to develop a better storage battery for use in electric vehicles. Edison very much enjoyed automobiles and owned a number of different types during his life, powered by gasoline, electricity, and steam. Edison thought that electric propulsion was clearly the best method of powering cars, but realized that conventional lead-acid storage batteries were inadequate for the job. Edison began to develop an alkaline battery in 1899. It proved to be Edison's most difficult project, taking ten years to develop a practical alkaline battery. By the time Edison introduced his new alkaline battery, the gasoline powered car had so improved that electric vehicles were becoming increasingly less common, being used mainly as delivery vehicles in cities. However, the Edison alkaline battery proved useful for lighting railway cars and signals, maritime buoys, and miners lamps. Unlike iron ore mining, the heavy investment Edison made over ten years was repaid handsomely, and the storage battery eventually became Edison's most profitable product. Further, Edison's work paved the way for the modern alkaline battery.By 1911, Thomas Edison had built a vast industrial operation in West Orange. Numerous factories had been built through the years around the original laboratory, and the staff of the entire complex had grown into the thousands. To better manage operations, Edison brought all the companies he had started to make his inventions together into one corporation, Thomas A. Edison Incorporated, with Edison as president and chairman. Edison was sixty-four by this time and his role with his company and in life began to change. Edison left more of the daily operations of both the laboratory and the factories to others. The laboratory itself did less original experimental work and instead worked more on refining existing Edison products such as the phonograph. Although Edison continued to file for and receive patents for new inventions, the days of developing new products that changed lives and created industries were behind him.In the 1915, Edison was asked to head the Naval Consulting Board. With the United States inching closer towards the involvement in World War One, the Naval Consulting Board was an attempt to organize the talents of the leading scientists and inventors in the United States for the benefit of the American armed forces. Edison favored preparedness, and accepted the appointment. The Board did not make a notable contribution to the final allied victory, but did serve as a precedent for future successful cooperation between scientists, inventors and the United States military. During the war, at age seventy, Edison spent several months on Long Island Sound in a borrowed navy vessel experimenting on techniques for detecting submarines.Edison's role in life began to change from inventor and industrialist to cultural icon, a symbol of American ingenuity, and a real life Horatio Alger story. In 1928, in recognition of a lifetime of achievement, the United States Congress voted Edison a special Medal of Honor. In 1929 the nation celebrated the golden jubilee of the incandescent light. The celebration culminated at a banquet honoring Edison given by Henry Ford at Greenfield Village, Ford's new American history museum, which included a complete restoration of the Menlo Park Laboratory. Attendees included President Herbert Hoover and many of the leading American scientists and inventors.The last experimental work of Edison's life was done at the request of Edison's good friends Henry Ford, and Harvey Firestone in the late 1920s. They asked Edison to find an alternative source of rubber for use in automobile tires. The natural rubber used for tires up to that time came from the rubber tree, which does not grow in the United States. Crude rubber had to be imported and was becoming increasingly expensive. With his customary energy and thoroughness, Edison tested thousands of different plants to find a suitable substitute, eventually finding a type of Goldenrod weed that could produce enough rubber to be feasible. Edison was still working on this at the time of his death.During the last two years of his life Edison was in increasingly poor health. Edison spent more time away from the laboratory, working instead at Glenmont. Trips to the family vacation home in Fort Myers, Florida became longer. Edison was past eighty and suffering from a number of ailments. In August 1931 Edison collapsed at Glenmont. Essentially house bound from that point, Edison steadily declined until at 3:21 am on October 18, 1931 the great man died.Last updated: February 26, 2015"	1.0

Stay over 180 days would therefore require a visa.Trump says this measure is to strengthen trade between the United States and Pakistan.However, Pakistanis who hold dual nationality will be banned from entering the United States if their other passport is from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen — the seven Muslim-majority countries “of concern”.It has emerged that trade and bilateral visa deals have been discussed by Trump and Pakistani Diplomats in the States.A source at the White House has hinted that Trump may revoke Australia’s opportunity of traveling to the United States without visas after cancelling all trade deals with the country.Allowing Pakistanis to the United States freely is not the only order signed into force by Trump since assuming office. He has signed five new executive orders – including one to expedite environmental review and approval of high-priority infrastructure projects.President Donald Trump signed executive orders to advance the construction of the controversial Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines.He also signed an executive order on Monday barring federal funds from organizations that promote abortion around the world, including the International Planned Parenthood Federation, in what activists say is the president’s first major pro-life action while in office.No more funds for Abortion-promotion organizationsThe policy, known as the Mexico City Policy or the Global Gag Rule, was first ushered in under Ronald Reagan and bars federal funds from going to foreign organizations that perform abortions overseas or lobby for the practice’s legalization in other countries.He has formally withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal on Monday, distancing America from its Asian allies as China’s influence in the region rises.Fulfilling a campaign pledge to end American involvement in the 2015 pact, Trump signed an executive order in the Oval Office pulling the United States from the 12-nation TPP.Donald Trump signs a visa-free travel policy for Pakistan added by onFebruary 11, 2016	1.0

Five people were killed, eight injured and one person was unharmed in custody, said police and local officials. Hundreds of people were standing on the tarmac outside the terminal as dozens of police cars and ambulances rushed to the scene. A witness told MSNBC that the gunman was a “slender man” who was wearing a Star Wars T-shirt. Florida Senator Bill Nelson told media that the gunman has been identified as Esteban Santiago, but that has not been confirmed by law enforcement.Former half-term governor of Alaska Sarah Palin took to the press to offer her thoughts and prayers to the families of the victims, but also used the opportunity to once again criticize former President Barack Obama’s policy on illegal immigration. “First of all, I’d like to offer my condolences to the families of the victims of the Fort Lauderdale terrorist attack, as well as my support to those who have been injured in the incident,” she said. “Make no mistake – this was a full-on terrorist attack, the likes of which we’ve had several in the past months and years. These lone-wolf terrorist attacks have today become a danger far greater than any terrorist cell that might be planning an attack on U.S. soil. It is terrible that we are faced with such an unpredictable network of individuals who will stop at nothing in order to harm innocent civilians.”She added, “However, don’t be fooled by the idea that there was no stopping this sort of escalation of terrorist violence. We could have prevented all of this 8 years ago, but unfortunately, the citizens of this country – more specifically, true, conservative Americans were outvoted by those who believed Barack Obama was the right choice for president. Eight years later, I’m sad to say America is choking on terrorism, racial issues and gender catastrophes the likes of which are unknown in its recent history. Not only were the liberals not right; they have single-handedly surrendered this country into the hands of a man who’s done more damage to it than any Bush, Reagan or Stalin, for that matter, ever could.”“It is Barack Obama’s policy of allowing Mexican Muslims to walk freely on our streets that has caused so much death and destruction recently, including this latest incident which has taken 5 innocent lives,” she continued. “Think about that for a second. Why were Mexican Muslims even allowed to walk our streets in the first place, I ask you? They’re, like, double the threat – they’re half Muslim, which means that they hate all of America by default, and the other half is Mexican, which means they can be very hard-working, but at the same time, they’re also very jealous of white people. And if, by some miracle, you were to add just an ounce of Germanic heritage to that, you’d have Hitler in the mix as well. That means they’d be the ultimate killing machine. They should have been incarcerated from the beginning. Instead, we’re left with this situation.”“I guarantee you no potential gunman would have ever seen the light of day other than through prison bars if anyone other than Barack Obama had been president. All Muslim Mexicans would be scrutinized several times, compared to normal Muslims and Mexicans, the majority of whom would only be subjected to one scrutinization process yearly. Instead, they were left to their own twisted behavior under the excuse of civil liberties, and what happened? We had the Orlando gay club massacre, and now Fort Lauderdale. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out there’s a pretty obvious pattern here. And you better believe there’s more of them coming. So, when the next one happens, I’m not even going to look into who or what the shooter was. I’m directly going after Obama for carelessness on the job and dereliction of duty. Because, he was many things as president, but a patriot was not one of them,” Palin concluded.Most Popular >>	1.0
https://www.snopes.com/robert-gallo-invented-hiv-aids/	Did the Man Who Discovered the HIV Virus Confess to ‘Inventing’ It?	false	['aids', ' anti news network', ' conspiracy theories', ' fake news', ' hiv', ' robert gallo', ' your news wire']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/K4IWw	2017/06/12	 Post Views: 29,290Dr. Gallo: “I Invented AIDS To Depopulate Humanity”:Dr. Robert Gallo, the scientist credited with ‘discovering’ the HIV virus in 1984, has admitted that he created AIDS in order to reduce the world’s population. In 1984, Gallo filed a U.S. patent application for his invention of the HIV/AIDS virus.Dailypost.co.za   reports:Normally, when a patent is filed and approved, as Dr. Gallo’s was, anyone who uses the product or invention owes a royalty payment to the artificer.Thus, holding the intellectual property laws to their fullest interpretations, one must solely marvel why Dr. Gallo has yet to file a proceedings seeking to recover damages from the usage of his invention? As odd as this state of affairs could sound, it bears need for extra scrutiny.The scientific evidence is complete and compelling, the AIDS Virus is a designer bi-product of the U.S. Special Virus program. The Special Virus program was a federal virus development program that persisted in the U.S from 1962 until 1978…..The U.S. Special Virus was then added as ‘compliment’ to vaccinum inoculations in Africa and Manhattan. Shortly thereafter the world was engulfed with mass infections of somebody’s animal virus that differed from any illustrious human sickness, it was highly contagious and additional significantly,A review of the Special Virus Flow Chart (“research logic”) reveals the United States was seeking a ‘virus particle’ that might negatively impact the defense mechanisms of the system. The program sought to modify the ordination of the virus particle during which to splice in associate degree animal “wasting disease” referred to as “Visna”.According to the Proceedings of the us of America, AIDS is an biological process, laboratory development of the peculiar Visna Virus, first detected in Icelandic sheep. Recently, American and world scientists ensure with 100 percent certainty the laboratory genesis of AIDS.This fact is more underscored once one reviews the ‘multiply-spliced’ nature of the HIV ‘tat’ sequence and Dr. Gallo’s 1971 Special Virus paper, “Reverse Transcriptase of Type-C virus Particles of Human Origin”.Dr. Gallo’s 1971 Special Virus paper is identical to his 1984 announcement of AIDS. Upon further review the record reveals that he filed his patent on AIDS, before he made the announcement with Secretary troubler. Earlier this year, Dr. Gallo conceded his role as a ‘Project Officer’ for the federal virus development program, the Special Virus.The Flow Chart of the program and the 15 progress reports are undeniable proof of the United States’ game to cull world populations via the unleashing of a stealing biological organism that may ‘waste’ humanity.In light of this true genesis of the world’s most divesting biological scourge, it is the u. s. that owes ‘royal’ payments to the innocent victims. Each associated each victim of AIDS is worthy of a proper apology and a way of economic closure for an invention of death and despair, perpetrated by the United States.The eyes of the world are upon the overall Accounting Office’s Health Care Team, under the direction of William J. Scanlon. Between 1964 and 1978, the secret federal virus program spent $550 million dollars of payer cash to create AIDS. It is now necessary to pay no matter it takes to dismantle associate invention that has junction rectifier to the best crime against humanity within the history of the globe.	1.0

This week, the states Republican-led senate passed the so-called Mississippi Church Protection Act which would militarize the states churches while also walking back gun regulations and stripping away oversight.The bill would allow churches to create security programs and designate and train members to carry concealed weapons. It would provide criminal and legal protections to those serving as church security.The bill also would allow concealed carry in a holster without a permit in Mississippi, expanding a measure passed last year that allowed concealed carry without a permit in a purse, satchel or briefcase, and another recent law that allows open carry in public.The bill also seeks to prohibit Mississippi officials from enforcing any federal agency regulations or executive orders that would violate the state constitution  an attempt to federal gun restrictions not passed by Congress.Mississippi church goers will now get to assign church members as security which can carry concealed weapons without permits and are protected from legal liability if their actions result in death based on a designation of justifiable homicide  the same legal standing that we afford police officers on duty.@pourmecoffee It passed pic.twitter.com/H8WvOdHFA4 pourmecoffee (@pourmecoffee) March 30, 2016What could go wrong?Much of this baffling new legislation is in direct response to NRA lobbying directives to erode existing gun laws in order to create a polite society of heavily-armed citizens. Exploiting tragedy (and ignoring irony) the NRA has used recent mass shootings to push for more guns, not less. The narrative goes that if only churches would have access to firearms, shootings like the one in Charleston, South Carolina, could be prevented.Subscribe to our Youtube Channel.ytsub-wrapper{width:100%;float:left;margin:24px 0;background:#D12827;height:46px;text-decoration:none;}.ytsub-margin{width:440px;margin:0 auto}.ytsub-text{float:left;font-size:18px;font-family:helvetica,arial,sans-serif;color:#fff;margin-top:12px;}.ytsub-button{background:url(https://s29.postimg.org/rogixn1br/ytsub_button.jpg);width:120px;height:28px;float:right;margin-top:9px;position:relative;z-index:9999;}@media screen and (max-width:469px) {.ytsub-wrapper {height: 88px;}.ytsub-margin {width:340px;display:inline;}.ytsub-text {font-size:17px;text-align:center;width:100%;margin-top:12px;display:inline;}.ytsub-button {top:43px;float: none;margin: 0 auto;background-repeat: no-repeat;}}The premise, as tempting as it sounds for would-be vigilantes, has been thoroughly debunked both in theory and in practice. Data suggests that as the number of guns increase, the risk of someone being shot by those guns also increases. Places with a lot of good guys with guns tend to have higher incidences of gun injuries. Go figure. At the same time, anecdotal evidence supports these warnings as well. Weve seen that guns in churches often lead to disastrous accidents, while at the same time not once stopping a mass shooting in a house of worship.With the removal of even permit requirements, Mississippi is planning on handing over the power of life and death to a bunch of untrained, untested amateurs who wont even have the risk of prosecution keeping their index finger off the trigger. A militarized church security unit assigned by the church, trained by the church, and meant to protect the church by any means necessary. If Mississippi legislators cant see the inherent danger in this as the bill heads to the House of Representatives to be finalized, then we are in a lot of trouble.Featured image via George Frey/Getty ImagesShare this Article!

									 Update 12:20 pm 11/09/16: You can read our retraction and apology here. Update 11:16 AM 11/09/16: We have received reports that “pro-life” was removed from Trump’s list of policies several days ago or, counter to our understanding when this was published, may never have been there at all. Other pro-life content seems to have been removed from Trump’s site between Nov 6 and today. We will update further as soon as we have anything clearer than that. I mentioned this in my earlier post but I need to emphasize it right now. Less than half a day after Donald J. Trump was elected president of the United States, he removed the words “pro-life” from his list of policies on his official website. Have a look for yourself. Yes. The man who was always pro-abortion, who conveniently discovered the value of unborn human life after announcing his candidacy for president, has removed “pro-life” from his policies less than a day after using the pro-life movement and getting what he wanted from them. Congratulations to all of the staunch conservative “pro-lifers” who decided this was their one issue and the only way to achieve it was to vote Republican. Congratulations to everybody who called me a pro-abort when I said that ‘pro-life” leaders needed to repent of their Republican idolatry. He used you and dumped you, just as Steel Magnificat and anyone else with more sense than gravel predicted from the beginning. Now you know what his ex wives feel like. I hope you feel filthy. You elected a pro-abortion philandering racist narcissist, because you thought it was the only way to be “pro-life.”
	

	
You sold your birthright for a bowl of lentils and now you don’t get to eat the lentils either. I wonder if the disgraced perpetrator of public sacrilege Father Frank Pavone, who devoted the past year to getting Trump elected and who is currently under investigation by his bishop for desecrating a naked dead infant and a holy altar, still thinks he’s going to be put on Trump’s Catholic advisory board. As I’ve previously stated, if anyone wants to join with me in forming a movement that actually respects all life from conception until natural death, I’m keen, but I feel like I should never use “pro-life” without scare quotes again. The “pro-life” movement as it stands today is nothing but a group of Republican shills and they’ve gotten exactly what they deserved.

John McCain was stationed on the Forrestal at the time and was quite likely responsible for the fire that killed 134 sailors and injured 62 others. Hot dog pilots were well known for their ""wet-starts,"" a process which allows fuel to build up in the engine before hitting the plane's start switch. The result of the wet-start is a long flame erupting from the tail of the plane. It was done simply for effect, a showy procedure meant to draw attention to the pilot. On June 29, 1967, John McCain is alleged to have used a wet-start to ""shake up"" a pilot in the plane behind him. The result was a fired rocket, dropped bombs and a fire that raged for nearly two days. 134 sailors lost their lives and another 62 were badly injured. McCain never had to answer for the incident. His father and grandfather were Navy admirals with a great deal of sway. Three months after the Forrestal disaster McCain was shot down over North Vietnam. You know the rest of the story. Is this man a maverick or a dangerous lunatic? Should we wait until he is president to know the answer?"	1.0

As a teen, he dreamed of becoming an anthropologist and later an illustrator, which his father, the owner of a stationery store, called ""not a proper occupation."" But Lucas is sure that the Force was always with him. ""I believe that even if I had become an anthropologist, I still would've started making movies and ended up right where I am now,"" he says. ""This path has been too strongly etched, and it's too winding."" While he has been wandering, we've been wondering:

Q: You're only now making the beginning of the Star Wars series. Why didn't you start with the beginning in 1977, instead of with Episode IV? A: Originally when I wrote Star Wars, it was meant to be one episode of a Saturday-matinee serial and you came in in the middle of it. I wrote a couple of screenplays, and they got very big, so I took the first act and made a movie out of that, but I swore to make the rest of the movie in three parts. In order to do that, I had to write a back story, so I said maybe I'll do the prequels. Q: You started out as an avant-garde director. How did you end up making movies for 12-year-olds? A: American Graffiti got so successful, I thought, Gee, making films for younger people actually is not a bad thing. I've always been very curious about culture, how a society develops its own equilibrium. I realized we were out of equilibrium at some point. We had reached a period in terms of our society of not having a mythology, a code that you pass down to the next generation. Friendship is valuable, honor is valuable. There wasn't a movie genre like that aimed at younger people, the 12-year-olds coming of age. Q: The morals we learn from Darth Vader's lifeabout letting go and making amendsare dominant themes in 12-step programs. Did you ever go through recovery for drugs or alcohol? A: I never did drugs. Drinking was never a problem. But I've done a lot of research, and those [morals] are very valid. The interesting thing about the 12 steps is that they work, and not just for addictive people. I'm very interested in psychology. I dabble in that stuff with my friends. I spend most of my fun time arguing, pontificating, discussing those things. Q: What religion are you? A: I was raised Methodist. Now let's say I'm spiritual. It's Marin County. We're all Buddhists up here. Q: Do you read reviews? A: I gave up reading reviews a long time ago. It's become a medium that is more like gossip. Q: Do you read about Star Wars on the Internet? A: When I was working on Phantom Menace, I saw a lot of the Internet stuff. I lasted about six weeks. Q: Why do the women in your movies have such crazy hairdos? A: In the 1977 film, I was working very hard to create something different that wasn't fashion, so I went with a kind of Southwestern Pancho Villa woman revolutionary look, which is what that is. The buns are basically from turn-of-the-century Mexico. Then it took such hits and became such a thing. In the new trilogy, the same thing applies, to try and do something timeless. I'm just basically having a good time.

The victims, all black men in their early 20s, were torn limb from limb and fed to Scott’s impressive collection of deadly reptiles.While she refused to answer questions, her lawyer did disclose that Ms. Scott was the victim of several black men in her early 20s:“One left when she got pregnant, forcing her to abort. One took everything she owned and slipped out in the middle of the night and the last one, when she told him about her misfortune and told him she wanted to go slow, raped her and got away with it.My client has a reason to dislike young, attractive black men.”Some would agree. Most would also say that just because you’re the victim of hood rats and thugs doesn’t give you the right to go and murder people. Maybe if it were self-defense, but she lured all of her subsequent victims with marijuana and home cooking. She recorded every moment.The case against her will certainly ruin Senator Montgomery, as much of the carnage happened when he was the governor of Delaware right in the Executive Mansion. The Delaware Attorney general says she will definitely be seeking the death penalty. Join America's Last Line of Defense And Share This Article Now!2.3k	1.0

I used to tease him, saying he looked like one and that he’d find his soulmate in the jungle. Never would I have thought he would be sexually assaulted by one ”– Kelly O’Reilly, motherThe young man was quickly brought back to a missionary hospital near Kalimantan where he lay unconscious for many hours and where doctors found traces of internal bleeding.Kelly O’Reilly, the victim’s mother, says she used to tease him, telling her son he looked like a orangutan, but she never suspected he would be sexually assaulted by one, she told reporters in tearsFamiliar traitsKekbek Mahlouiak, one of the tour guides present on the dramatic trip, says he has warned various tourists to be careful around the animals.“I specifically told him to wear a hat and hide his orange hair, that it could entice the orangutans. I’m not surprised of what has happened, I warned him many times. He did not listen,” he told local reporters.“It is very dangerous for people with orange hair, the males get very excited. A male followed us deep into the jungle many kilometers, he was very aggressive. There is nothing I could do,” he added.An isolated incidentA spokeswoman for the Borneo Tourism Board said it is the first time an orangutan has physically assaulted a tourist on one of their jungle treks.“We are deeply horrified and saddened by the whole affair. We have offered the young victim a free tour if he ever wishes to come back again and will provide increased security for our travelers in the future,” she added.A similar incident was previously reported in a Jakarta zoo in 2014, when a young red-haired woman was hospitalized after an orangutan broke out of its cage and tried to mate with the visitor, resulting in the death of the animal by zoo employees.	1.0

Babcock By Charles R. Babcock May 28, 1992The net worth of Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary increased significantly over the past two years to nearly $700,000, according to a financial statement the Democratic presidential candidate released yesterday.An 84 percent increase in the value of their investment portfolio and including the couples' $180,200 in retirement plans in their assets accounted for most of the change, campaign aide Betsey Wright said. Their net worth at the end of 1989 was $418,692.The statement shows the Clintons' personal wealth, though more than that of most Americans, is far less than that of his likely rivals in the presidential race, Texas businessman Ross Perot and President Bush.Perot's fortune has been estimated at more than $2 billion. Bush released a detailed financial statement recently indicating his net worth is about $3.7 million, including $1.3 million in a blind trust and the $2.2 million value of his home in Kennebunkport, Maine. Bush listed no liabilities.The Clinton statement said that as of Dec. 31, 1991, the couple had assets of $862,980 and liabilities of $165,603. The assets were listed as $158,056 in cash, $387,077 in investments, including stocks and partnerships, the $180,200 in the retirement plans, an $80,000 interest in a condominium and $57,647 in personal property.The debts were a $64,848 mortgage for half-interest in a Little Rock condominium they own with Hillary's parents and a $100,755 bank loan from the 1990 governor's race. The campaign committee will pay back the gubernatorial loan, Wright said.Two years ago, the Clintons released a net worth statement listing assets of $489,692 and a single liability, the then-$71,000 mortgage. Listed separately at the time were retirement accounts totaling about $124,000.According to federal tax returns they made public, the Clintons' total income for 1991 was $234,428, up 19 percent from 1989.politicsGet 2016 Olympics updates by emailOur best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox.post_newsletter333	1.0
https://www.snopes.com/trump-leaks-classified-info/	Trump Leaks Classified Info After Intelligence Briefing	false	['classified information', ' donald trump', ' national security', ' saudi arabia']	https://www.washingtonpost.com/	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/29/clinton-and-trump-will-soon-receive-classified-briefings-heres-how-that-works/	2016/07/30	"At some point, perhaps as early as next week, federal agents will sit down with Donald Trump and tell him classified information about the government and our foreign-policy efforts. For Democrats, this is a point of both anguish and political calculation. Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid has suggested that Trump's murky ties to foreign interests and general inability to not speak his mind should be reason enough for the people briefing him to simply make things up. On the Republican side, there are similar calls to ban Hillary Clinton from being briefed, including by Trump, pointing to her use of a personal email server while she served as secretary of state. And here's the thing: If he wanted to, President Obama could deny either or both of them the now-traditional briefings. The process doesn't work the way you might think. For one thing, the briefings are not legally mandated. They are a courtesy provided by the sitting president, nothing more. In an email, historian Michael Beschloss explained that the process began with President Harry Truman. In 1952, as Truman was preparing to leave the White House, he ordered that the CIA brief Dwight Eisenhower and Adlai Stevenson ""so that they would campaign with greater insight and also know key national security players once elected."" (A bigger problem, he notes, for Stevenson, a governor, than Eisenhower, who'd commanded the Allied invasion of Normandy.) No president has to do it; presidents a century ago didn't. For another, the briefings are not an ongoing series of updates about everything affecting our foreign policy. They aren't as regular or as detailed as the Presidential Daily Brief, for example. It's at most a couple of in-person meetings between the candidate, a staffer and representatives of the American intelligence community. Lanhee Chen, who worked as the chief policy adviser to Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign, spoke with The Washington Post by phone on Thursday. Chen was the one staffer that attended Mitt Romney's two briefings four years ago. The former secretary of state, senator and first lady is the Democratic nominee for president. Wait 1 second to continue. ""The nominee has access to one, maybe two or three [briefings] upon request, but that's it,"" Chen said. ""Because it's not like you have a ton of time to sit there and get briefed every day anyway."" ""The briefings have to take place in SCIFs"" — sensitive compartmented information facilities — ""or secure conferencing facilities that the government has, so it's not like you can just get the briefing on the campaign bus,"" he said. ""We had two briefings: One was at the federal building in Los Angeles in September, and the second was a few weeks later at a secure facility in the Washington, D.C., metro area. That was it."" The number and content of those briefings are negotiated between the campaign and the White House. A memorandum of understanding is drafted between the two parties to formalize the agreement, but Chen notes that the process was remarkably easy and cordial — particularly given that the administration that was briefing Romney was also in the process of trying to defeat him electorally. The briefings themselves Chen described as a sort of presentation followed by a question-and-answer period. ""It is, as I understand it, the same team of briefers from the intelligence community that prepare the briefing for the candidate"" as those who do the president's daily briefing, Chen said. ""But the level of detail as well as the amount of information covered is not the same. It is meant to be a background briefing more than anything else."" The information that's presented is tailored to what the candidate would like to know; as you might expect, there are no handouts. It's worth noting that, while these are the only formal briefings, there was information shared by the federal government with the Romney campaign outside of the scope of national security. As Hurricane Sandy approached that fall, Chen said, the campaign was given emergency-response information from the Federal Emergency Management Administration and the Department of Homeland Security. Businessman Donald Trump officially became the Republican nominee at the party’s convention in Cleveland. Wait 1 second to continue. In order to participate in the briefings, Chen had to complete paperwork to grant him top-secret security clearance, which he held through the end of the campaign. Romney didn't, Chen said. ""The assumption is that a certain amount of sensitive information can be shared with the nominee because the nominee has been publicly vetted,"" Chen said. Both GOP vice-presidential nominee Rep. Paul D. Ryan and Romney had held or did hold security clearance (Romney's stemming from his time managing the 2002 Winter Olympics), but if they hadn't — like Trump — they would not have had to submit the same documentation. ""The information we received was obviously classified,"" he said, ""but I don't believe that that information was of the same scope and specificity that the president or vice president or other national security leaders get once they're actually in office."" He also indicated that the people conducting the briefing were more than capable of understanding what sorts of boundaries to information-sharing shouldn't and wouldn't be crossed. For those worried about a candidate getting access to information and then using it in the campaign, it has happened — or so Richard Nixon believed. Beschloss related a story about the 1960 election, pitting John F. Kennedy against Nixon, who was then serving as vice president to Eisenhower, known colloquially as ""Ike."" In 1960, Ike had JFK briefed by CIA Director Allen Dulles. That fall, JFK publicly called for US-backed “freedom-fighters” to invade Castro’s Cuba. Nixon was furious, presuming that Dulles had told JFK about the CIA-backed invasion then being planned (the record is unclear about what exactly Dulles told JFK about this), and that JFK had gone ahead and publicly called for something he knew the CIA was secretly planning. Nixon said in his book ""Six Crises"" that, to protect the operation’s secrecy, he felt compelled in his TV debates against JFK to denounce the idea of such an invasion, which he did — handing JFK the potent Cuba issue, so he felt. Also Nixon was angry at Dulles for not using his briefing of JFK to definitively knock down the idea of a Missile Gap — notion that USSR was soaring ahead of US in missiles — leaving JFK free to use this important issue in the campaign. Nixon felt that Dulles did so deliberately in order to cultivate JFK and get reappointed to the CIA, which he was. It left Nixon forever suspicious of the CIA and its ability to foil him politically (a refrain you can hear on the Nixon tapes when he was President). Chen doesn't figure that concerns about either of the current nominees potentially using information to their advantage (or letting something slip) will cause the Obama administration to avoid briefing a candidate or skip the briefings entirely. He notes that what is disclosed is up to the administration, and how it is disclosed is up to people briefing the candidates who are well aware of the risks of sharing information — and how to nuance what's said. But he also notes that the process of national security briefings is a small part of what makes presidential transitions smooth and conflict-free.""There is a lot of discretion, comity and professional courtesy involved in how it all works. But it did all work,"" he said. ""It sort of gave me even more faith in the nature of our democratic system,"" Chen said, ""that there could be this kind of information-sharing and civil dialogue, even in the heat of a very, very difficult campaign."" Or put another way: The briefings are a well-controlled feature to our democracy, not a bug."	1.0
https://www.snopes.com/toddlers-killed-americans-terrorists/	Toddlers Killed More Americans than Terrorists in 2015	true	['chattanooga shooting', ' christopher ingraham', ' san bernardino shooting', ' toddler involved shootings', ' toddler shootings', ' washington post']	https://www.washingtonpost.com/	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/14/people-are-getting-shot-by-toddlers-on-a-weekly-basis-this-year/	2015/12/17	"By Christopher Ingraham By Christopher Ingraham Email the author October 14, 2015 Email the author Follow @_cingrahamThis week a 2-year-old in South Carolina found a gun in the back seat of the car he was riding in and accidentally shot his grandmother , who was sitting in the passenger seat. This type of thing happens from time to time: A little kid finds a gun, fires it, and hurts or kills himself or someone else. These cases rarely bubble up to the national level except when someone, like a parent , ends up dead.But cases like this happen a lot more frequently than you might think. After spending a few hours sifting through news reports, I've found at least 43 instances this year of somebody being shot by a toddler 3 or younger. In 31 of those 43 cases, a toddler found a gun and shot himself or herself.In August, for instance, a 21-month-old in the St. Louis area found a loaded handgun at his grandmother's house and shot himself in the torso. His mother took him to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Earlier in the year a Michigan 3-year-old found a loaded .40-caliber handgun in a closet while his dad and brother were outside. He shot himself in the head and died before rescue workers arrived.[ This is what one year of gun deaths in America looks like ]The stories go on and on like this: Roughly once a week this year, on average, a small child has found a gun, pointed it at himself or someone else, and pulled the trigger. Boys are disproportionately likely to do this: I could find only three cases where a girl under the age of 4 wounded someone with a gun. In 13 of the 43 total incidents, a child's self-inflicted injuries were fatal. In two other cases, another person died after being shot by a toddler: a father in Alabama , and a 1-year-old in Ohio .In one instance, a 3-year-old managed to wound both of his parents with a single gunshot at an Albuquerque motel. Shootings by toddlers have happened in 24 states so far this year. Missouri has seen the most, with five separate incidents. Florida has had four. Texas, three. Due to the low number of total cases and the isolated nature of these incidents I'd caution against drawing broad conclusions from the map above. But it is worth noting that the shootings don't necessarily follow broader population trends. California, the most populous state in the nation, hasn't had any. Nobody has been shot by a toddler in New England or the Upper Midwest.These numbers are probably an undercount. There are likely instances of toddlers shooting people that result in minor injuries and no media coverage. And there are probably many more cases where a little kid inadvertently shoots a gun and doesn't hit anyone, resulting in little more than a scared kid and (hopefully) chastened parents.Notably, these numbers don't include cases where toddlers are shot, intentionally or otherwise, by older children or adults. Dozens of preschoolers are killed in acts of homicide each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . But I haven't included those figures here.[ How often do children in the U.S. unintentionally shoot and kill people? We don’t know. ]These cases are invariably referred to as ""accidents"" in media reports. But as Everytown for Gun Safety, a group that advocates for stricter gun laws, argues, many incidents like this are preventable. In a study of accidental shootings by children of all ages (not just toddlers), they estimate that ""more than two-thirds of these tragedies could be avoided if gun owners stored their guns responsibly and prevented children from accessing them.""There are policy and technical responses to preventable childhood gun deaths as well. States and localities could require guns to be locked up at home, a policy supported by 67 percent of Americans . Various types of smart gun technology, which prevent anyone other than their owners from firing a given gun, exist as well . But gun lock requirements and smart guns have been vehemently opposed by the National Rifle Association and its allies.Instead, the NRA continues to promote a response that seeks to solve gun problems with more guns , and aims to broaden the saturation of firearms in nearly every sphere of public and private life, from homes to schools to churches to bars to airports and beyond. In a country with more guns than people , it's only natural that a certain number of small children are going get their hands on an unsecured firearm, with tragic consequences.[ Guns in America: For every criminal killed in self-defense, 34 innocent people die ]Depending on where you stand on gun policy, you may feel that 13 dead toddlers in 10 months is too many. Or, you might reason that stuff happens , and that this is part of the price we must pay to protect our gun rights.I've included my tally of toddler shootings below. News sources are linked in the City column. Know of any this year that I missed? Drop me a line .Date"	1.0

(Courtesy: Brittany Mann)There was no halftime show under the Friday night lights at Mississippi’s Brandon High School — the marching band had been benched.The band was ordered off the field because the Christian hymn “How Great Thou Art” was a part of their halftime show — in violation of a federal court order.Click here to join Todd’s American Dispatch - a MUST-READ for Conservatives!  “The Rankin County School Board and District Office are very saddened students will not be able to perform their halftime show they have worked so hard on this summer,” the district wrote in a statement to the Clarion Ledger newspaper.In 2013 a student sued the district over a series of Christian meetings that had been held on school property, the newspaper reported. The district later settled the lawsuit and acknowledged they had violated the student’s First Amendment rights.  In July, U.S. District Court Judge Carlton Reeves ruled the district had violated the agreement after a Christian minister delivered a prayer at an awards ceremony.  Judge Reeves, who was appointed to the bench by President Obama, came down hard on the school district — ordering them to pay thousands of dollars in fines. He also warned the district that future violations would cost them $10,000.“Defendants are permanently enjoined from including prayer, religious sermons or activities in any school sponsored event including but not limited to assemblies, graduations, award ceremonies, athletic events and any other school event,” the order reads.Word about the band getting benched spread across the town quicker than kudzu. I must have received emails and Facebook messages from nearly the entire state - from Desoto County to Yazoo City.   Something must be done to right this wrong, people said. A message had to be sent to the likes of Judge Reeves. Locals  gathered in coffee shops and garages to devise their plan. And what they did — would become known as the musical shot heard around the world.During halftime of Friday night’s game - a lone voice began to sing the forbidden song.“Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee,” the singer sang.Brittany Mann was there and she witnessed the entire moment of defiance. “We were just sitting there and then one by one people started to stand,” she told me. “At first, it started out as a hum but the sound got louder and louder.”She said it was a “truly incredible” moment to watch hundreds of people singing together in the stadium. “At that moment I was so proud of my town - coming together and taking a stand for something we believe in,” she said. “It breaks my heart to see where our country is going — getting farther and farther away from the Christian beliefs that our country was founded on.”  I suspect Miss Brittany wasn’t the only one who felt a sense of pride in the Magnolia State on that warm summer night.   “We may be pictured as toothless, barefoot, uneducated people around the country, but we are far from it,” nearby resident Mandy Miller told me. “I’m from Mississippi and I’m not ashamed to take a stand.”  Oh what a sight it must have been — as hundreds and hundreds of people stood together and with one voice — sent a message to Judge Reeves.“This is the kind of thing that makes me proud to be from the South,” Miss Mandy told me. “We are getting tired of being told to sit down and shut up. People are ready to fight back.”Miss Mandy is absolutely right. The time has come to stand up to the secularists.The time has come to put an end to their cultural jihad. I hope the Rankin County School Board will reconsider its decision and allow the marching band to resume performing “How Great Thou Art.”    And should Judge Reeves make good on his threat to financially punish the school district, I will personally pay the $10,000 fine. Todd Starnes is host of Fox News & Commentary.

https://www.snopes.com/jared-kushner-go-saudi-arabia-doesnt-extradition-treaty-us/	Did Jared Kushner Go to Saudi Arabia Because it Doesn’t Have an Extradition Treaty With the US?	false	['jared kushner', ' mueller', ' palmer report', ' russia investigation']	https://archive.fo/	https://archive.fo/f26gK	2017/10/31	Linkedin Google Whatsapp Pinterest Reddit Stumbleupon Buffer Tumblr Pocket Line-When Robert Mueller begins slapping handcuffs on the first batch of Donald Trump’s co-conspirators tomorrow, will Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner be among them? No one seems to know for sure. Suffice it to say, however, that Kushner is suddenly acting more than a bit suspiciously. In fact, Kushner just boarded a commercial jet and secretly left the country – and Trump’s White House is refusing to answer any questions about what’s going on.Kushner flew to Saudi Arabia, in what was clearly supposed to be a secret trip, as the White House refuses to say why he went there or what he did once he got there. He supposedly returned to the United States on Saturday night, according to a Politico report ( link ) – but considering the suspicious circumstances, that too could be a cover story; there’s no known proof that he actually did return to the U.S. There are scattered reports that Kushner may have had dinner with Ivanka Trump in Washington on DC on Saturday night, which we’re still working to track down.This raises a number of questions. Kushner was accompanied by a deputy national security adviser, so this doesn’t appear to have been some harebrained attempt at fleeing the country. That would have been a phenomenally stupid idea anyway. Although Saudi Arabia does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, it’s far too close of an ally to want to provide such controversial refuge. But this may have been a (perhaps mis-timed) attempt at conveniently being out of the country as Robert Mueller begins making arrests.In any case, Donald Trump’s White House’s refusal to answer any questions about Jared Kushner’s trip makes it all the more suspicious. If this were a legitimate diplomatic mission, it would be easy for the White House to provide a plausible explanation for the trip. Instead the obfuscation strongly suggests that Kushner staged the trip as some kind of bizarre response to the impending arrests.Help fund Palmer Report:Thanks for reading Palmer Report.

https://www.snopes.com/trumps-sister-donnies-acting-like-nutjob/	Did Trump’s Older Sister Say ‘Donnie’s Acting Like a Nutjob’?	false	['donald trump', ' fake news', ' maryanne trump barry', ' nova magazine', ' satire']	https://web.archive.org/	https://web.archive.org/web/20180116154621/https://www.nova-magazine.net/trumps-older-sister-worries-about-him/	2018/01/16	b'Trumps older sister is not happy about the behavior of her little brother, the President of the United States.Maryanne Trump Barry, Donald Trumps older sister and a United States Circuit Judge, told reporters over the weekend, Donnies not acting right. The 80-year-old also says she believes that President Trump might be forgetting to take his pills.I dont recognize the Donnie whos in the White House right now, added Judge Trump Barry, who friends describe as very loyal to her younger brother.Donnie was never a smart boy, no matter what he tells you. In fact, the neighborhood kids used to call him Donnie Dimwit. But recently he seems to be operating at an even lower IQ, and thats not good for the country.Asked what she thought might be behind Trumps recent mental decline, the judge answered thoughtfully: Look, its a tough job, made even tougher by the fact that Donnie is always trying to prove his value, competence, and strength. He acts like a hooligan, but its a cover-up  hes really insecure and very tender underneath that stern facade. Frankly, I always thought he was gay. Donnie used to run around in mothers dressing gowns, always wanted to take a bubble bath, and he had more talent for interior design than construction. When Daddy finished a residential building project, it was always little Donnie who insisted on choosing the drapes. My point is, I dont think the daily demands of the presidency align with his softer sensibilities...and now hes cracking under the pressure.She was also asked what she thought of her brothers performance as president one year into his term.I generally dont like it when witnesses come into my courtroom and plead the Fifth. But in this case, with that question, I am compelled to do so. Ill say simply that I wish my brother luck...and the country Godspeed.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) '	1.0

The Hillary supporters main subject was about how Hillary “Tells The Truth”. I was trying to explain to her how Hillary lies over and over. She then turned the subject into saying “So does everyone even Bernie”After about an hour of asking her to show any REAL proof of Bernie lying she gave up and said “Look it up your self” and “I don’t have time for you”. (These statements come after 2 hours of conversation).My last comment was going to be, “Clearly you can’t post any proof nor can I because he never lies”.But when I hit enter I got this popup. I though it was just a glitch, so I refreshed the page but same thing happened??? I clicked the link and was sent to a Facebook appeal form. I filled it out saying “I have done nothing wrong” A few hours went by and I got an email titled “Your Facebook appeal PLEASE READ”It was not from abuse@facebook.com or any of the Facebook email addresses so I first thought spam, then I was like how can anyone know I’m blocked from posting anything on Facebook besides me?The email was a guy saying he works for Facebook and to contact him via Skype. This was extremely weird, but I was curious to see where this was going.I added him on Skype. He accepted me right away and said “I’m going to tell you something you may or may not believe. All I ask is you do not share my email or Skype.I replied back “Ok but why not just contact me via a fake email and Skype then?”He said “They are fake but I still feel I could be traced”I said “Fair enough, but what is this all about?”He said “I work for Facebook, and I’m reaching out to people who have been blocked on Facebook after posting keywords like #FeelTheBern” At this point I’m kinda freaking out………  How does anyone know I have been blocked from posting? They also have my personal email and know about me posting #FeelTheBern. He then began to explain to me Facebook is actively and automatically blocking millions of accounts with a algorithm that detects people who post keywords like #FeelTheBurn. I for example was banned from posting anything for 30 days due to the fact I posted #FeelTheBernHe also said Quote: “In a staff briefing everyone was told to deny any appeal that happened due to posting political opinions”(As he laughed and said these members are banned due to spamming give them time to calm down). I asked him why not go public with a widely viewed TV network or huge websites like HuffingtonPost?He said: I have emailed a few local news TV stations plus all the big well known websites and 100’s of Facebook users, yet I haven’t seen this story get viral.I told him most likely the reason huge websites or news stations won’t talk about it is because they are scared to post something without having a face to back it up with.But I understand why he is scared to come out.He can be sued for breach of contractHe will lose his good paying jobHe would never be hired after leaking company information I promised I would do my best to get this information out to the world. This is insane! I knew the corrupt corporations ran the media but I never thought it would get down to blocking people from Facebook.What can you do?Share this post on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc.Contact HuffingtonPost asking them to reply to the emails sent.Contact Woodland Hills, CA. News station ABC7 to reply to the emails sent.  We can not let this subject get swept under the rug. This is a 1000 times worse then corrupt corporations running Fox News. This is like YouTube or Google removing any blog or video that says anything good about Bernie. 	1.0

Just to let you know, I also have three (3) daughters who are thirteen (13), fourteen (14), and sixteen (16).My son is a great dad and also a great boyfriend to me. This all started when I realized that I started to get feelings for him I decided to have a one and one talk with him. I told him “mommy loves you more than what it means to just be a mommy to you”. I also told him that “mommy likes you just like how a girl from school likes you.I explained everything to him and got him to understand and he felt the same way as I did as he began to ask questions. He asked “so does that mean that we can kiss and hold hands like boyfriend and girlfriend?” I told him yes and even sex.Long story short, he asked me if we can have a baby and I agreed and so we did.

In fact, there is a reason. $500,000 of them in fact.Transparency website Glass Tabletop revealed Saturday that just before the Friday evening vote, Schumer received three separate campaign donation from Immigration for Everyone, the Council for Alien Rights, and the Southern Border Defense Fund — three groups that regularly push for complete amnesty for all illegals.Thanks to this donation and his hatred of President Trump, Schumer was more than willing to encourage his fellow Democrats to vote against keeping the government open. 90% of them listened. Only five Democrats summoned enough patriotism to vote FOR America.2018 is our chance to reaffirm that we want Donald Trump’s America — that we want freedom and democracy and rule of law.

https://www.snopes.com/refugee-tb-rates-in-san-diego/	Are Refugee Tuberculosis Rates in San Diego ‘More Than 100 Times Greater’ Than the National Average?	false	['breitbart', ' el cajon', ' san diego', ' starbucks', ' tuberculosis', ' university of california-san diego']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/ILsJU	2017/08/17	SIGN UP FOR THE BREITBART EMAIL NEWSLETTERSIGN ME UPStarbucks Holds Hiring Event for Refugees in San Diego, TB Rates Among Highest in CountryAPby Michael Patrick Leahy 8 Aug 2017 47268 Aug, 20178 Aug, 2017Starbucks held a hiring event exclusively for refugees in El Cajon, California on Tuesday, part of its recently announced commitment to hire more than 10,000 refugees over the next five years.El Cajon is located in San Diego County, where more than 20,000 refugees have have been resettled by the federal government in the past nine and a half years since the beginning of Fiscal Year 2008.A 2013 study from a research team led by Dr. Timothy Rodwell , “an associate professor and physician in the Division of Global Health at UCSD [University of California at San Diego]” that “analyzed data from LTBI [latent tuberculosis infection] screening results of 4,280 refugees resettled in San Diego County between January 2010 and October 2012,” noted that “San Diego County, in California, is a leading refugee resettlement site, and it also has one of the highest rates of active TB in the country, with an incidence rate of 8.4 cases per 100 000 people in 2011.” (The incidence rate in the entire population in the United States in 2016 was 2.9 per 100,000 ).The study, which was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health, found  that, of the 4,280 refugees resettled in San Diego County during the 34 months beginning in January 2010:Nine hundred sixteen refugees (21.4%) in the study had a positive QFT-GIT result (Table 1). Of those, 823 (89.8%) had a normal chest radiograph and were diagnosed with LTBI (Figure 1). Sixty-one (6.7%) did not receive a chest radiograph; 14 (1.5%) had an abnormal result that was consistent with active TB; and 18 (2.0%) had an abnormal result that was not consistent with active TB.In other words, the incidence of active TB among the 4,280 refugees who were resettled in San Diego County between January 2010 and October 2012 was 327 per 100,000, more than 100 times greater than the incidence of active TB among the entire population of the United States in 2016.About four percent of the entire population of the United States tests positive for latent TB infection. Around 10 percent of those with LTBI will develop active TB at some point in their lives. The triggering mechanism to activate latent TB is not entirely understood, but high levels of stress, crowded living situations, poor public health practices, the presence of other diseases that lower the immune system, and behavioral conduct–such as smoking–appear to increase the chances of activation.The 21.4 percent of refugees in the San Diego County study who tested positive for latent TB infection is about five times the national average.Breitbart News contacted Starbucks to learn if their refugee hiring process will include mandatory testing for latent and active TB, but has not received a response.The Starbucks refugee hiring event will be held at the San Diego offices of the International Rescue Committee, one of the top nine voluntary agencies (VOLAGS) that are paid over $1 billion each year to resettle refugees in the United States.KGTV  reported :About 30 Starbucks managers will conduct on-the-spot interviews at the International Rescue Committee’s office located at 131 E. Main Street in El Cajon from 11 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 8. Applicants are encouraged to visit Starbucks online career center prior to the event and bring resumes along with them. The store managers will talk to the refugee applicants about what it’s like to work for Starbucks and review qualifications for the barista position.The world’s largest coffee chain said it would focus initial efforts on markets where refugee need is greatest and there’s a store base to meet the need.According to state and federal data, San Diego fits the bill.No other California county has received more refugees during the past decade than San Diego county.In 2016, San Diego settled 3,100 refugees, along with 520 military interpreters on special immigrant visas.California, like most states, requires TB testing for health care workers . Employees of restaurants are not required by California law to be tested for TB prior to hiring.Read More Stories About:P.S.

https://www.snopes.com/mark-zuckerberg-resignation/	Did Mark Zuckerberg Announce His Resignation from Facebook?	false	['ecomaxx', ' facebook', ' get ink news', ' mark zuckerberg']	https://archive.is/	https://archive.is/LSajx	2017/03/14	"GIFT IDEASMark Zuckerberg Disgusted With Social Media; Set To Leave Facebook Later This Year(ET, Tuesday, March 14, 2017) - Mark Zuckerberg helped to create a whole new world when he unveiled Facebook in 2004. Barely 20 years old, the fresh faced college student knew he had something special with his technological find. But even this genius had no way to predict how Facebook would change the world.Now, just 17 years later, this 32-year-old billionaire is ready to give it all up? Why? According to those closest to the developer, Zuckerberg is disgusted with the way the public has used and abused the platform. “He wanted to create a way for people to connect; not tear them apart,” explained one colleague.Since its inception, Facebook has enjoyed a wild ride of success. With more than 1.2 billion people logging on every single day, one would think that Zuckerberg fulfilled his dream of global connection. But, according to friends and coworkers, that wasn’t at all what Zuckerberg had in mind when he and a group of friends built the concept (and the reality) of the famous site back in their Harvard dormitory.“What Mark wanted most was to bring the world together. It’s not good enough if it brings along some people and leaves others behind.” And when it comes to using the platform he created to bully or disparage others, Zuckerberg is completely disgusted. “He hates the way some users utilize the platform to bring others down or even to circulate false accounts of events or history.”While Facebook itself begins a new chapter in harnessing its platform for the betterment of society, focusing on remaking the site in order to offer global connectedness while fighting isolationism and social ills. Although a manifesto recently released by Zuckerberg himself outlines a long-term plan by his company to revamp the site and “focus on social infrastructure for the community for supporting us, for keeping us safe, for informing us, for civic engagement, and for inclusion of all,” many behind the scenes say that the Facebook founder has no intention of being a part of the changes and will announce his exit from Facebook in the coming months.Since marrying wife Priscilla Chan M.D., in 2012, Zuckerberg has discovered a new passion: for eradicating disease and living a healthier lifestyle. A pediatrician who specializes in childhood disease, Chan convinced her husband last year to fund the Chan-Zuckerberg initiative, whose main focus is health and education. The initiative has also cited a long-term goal of working towards eradicating all disease by the end of the 21st century.Zuckerberg wants to focus on helping peopleThe daughter of Chinese refugees, Chan is a big believer in Traditional Chinese Medicine and holistic health regimes. She believes that western medicine is incomplete, only striving to treat illness, rather than get to its root cause and cure it. Using a combination of traditional healthcare approaches that date back centuries, in conjunction with modern technology and understanding of disease, Chan and Zuckerberg hope to find cures for thousands of disease now plaguing our society.While working so hard to find the key to unlocking the answers to curing disease in our lifetime, Zuckerberg and Chan discovered something they hadn’t expected: the fountain of youth. While investigating several all-natural holistic remedies for curing skin cancer, Chan stumbled across a new way to care for the skin. While it may not have been the cancer answer she sought, Chan did learn that the ingredients her researchers were using did seem to push back the hands of time, making the skin look younger, smoother and healthier.Mark and wife Priscilla are embarking on a joint business ventureEnthralled by the discovery, Chan put a team of researchers on the case, seeing how much they could learn about these all-natural ingredients. It took them months, but what they ultimately invented was amazing: creams and lotions that can strip away decades of skin damage, returning the skin to a more youthful state. Those who initially used the cream reported looking 10-15 years younger in less than a month!Understanding the full implications of their discovery, Chan quickly patented the invention and talked to her husband about funding the new project. Not really interested in the attention putting their names on the product would create (after all, they wanted this product to speak for itself), the couple decided to release their new skin car line without their name or their endorsement.So what is this amazing skin care line? You can find it under the name: EcoMaxx Skin Care. Since its release earlier this year, EcoMaxx has enjoyed a surge in popularity as celebrities flock to their skin care specialists for the cream.“It doesn’t matter how old they are, this cream smooth those lines; lightens dark sports; and simply makes your look younger,” said one popular actress. “Who need plastic surgery with this cream?”With popularity soaring, EcoMaxx is now releasing two new anti-aging products called EcoMaxx Ageless Moisturizer and EcoMaxx Ageless Eye Revitalizer . Aimed at woman of all ages, this expansion to the product line is expected to be as big a hit as the original age defying lotion.CELEBRITIES LOVE ECOMAXX“Zuckerberg is a genius! He changed the world with Facebook and now he’s changing the world of skincare. Since discovering EcoMaxx I don’t use any other brands anymore, EcoMaxx is far superior to all other anti-aging creams on the market.” - Katy Perry“With a busy lifestyle I noticed signs of premature aging starting to creep onto my skin. I was meeting with Mark and casually mentioned my troubled skin when he told me was creating a skincare line. I’ve been using it for a few weeks now and my skin is already 100x better.” - Selena Gomez“I met Mark during an interview and afterwards he secretly divulged his plans to create a skincare line with Priscilla. Of course I was interested and as a result he ended up sending me a few samples right before they launched. The EcoMaxx cream is hands down the best anti-aging cream I’ve ever used.” - Oprah Winfrey“Surely you’ve all seen those memes of how much I’ve aged since I started office? Since leaving the office I finally have time to do something about it and thanks to Mark and Priscilla, I’ve found a way. I use EcoMaxx morning and night!” - Barack Obama“I had the pleasure of interviewing Prsicilla and afterwards she kindly gave me some samples of their new skincare line to try out. I hate to say it, but I am in love with these creams. Nothing else I’ve used even compares to how effective EcoMaxx is.” - Savannah GuthrieZUCKERBERG GIVES PRODUCTS AWAY FOR FREE!So, what if you aren’t rich or famous? Chan and Zuckerberg don’t care. After all, they are already worth more than $556 billion.“We aren’t in this to make a fortune,” Chan told a friend recently. “We already have amassed a fortune. I just want to help people.”That is why she is now offering readers the opportunity to experience the joys of younger looking skin for FREE!The only cost to you is a $4.95 shipping and handling fee, so you can try the EcoMaxx Ageless Moisturizer and EcoMaxx Ageless Eye Revitalizer have it delivered right to your front door.

https://www.snopes.com/man-ejaculating-boss-coffee/	Was a Man Accused of Ejaculating in His Boss’ Coffee Daily for Four Years?	false	['coffee', ' semen', ' world news daily report']	https://archive.is/	https://archive.is/NIyS6	2017/06/15	initialinitialinitialsinitial TweetNewark, New Jersey | A man was arrested on his work site this morning after it was discovered that he was ejaculating in his employer’s coffee every morning.38-year old Lewis Williams spent the last four years working as the personal assistant of Ms. Linda Moore, executive president of the DANCO engineering firm.Among his tasks as Ms. Moore’s assistant, he was to take her phone calls, set her schedule and bring her a cup of coffee to her desk every day when she arrived at work.After a dispute with his boss this morning, Mr. Williams admitted in front of a dozen coworkers, that he had ejaculated in her coffee “hundreds of time”.According to Brian Little, an intern who witnessed the entire scene, Lewis Williams showed no remorse while he confessed his crime.“He almost looked proud when he told her: ‘I’ve been eating your shit for four years, but all this time, you’ve been drinking my cum!’ He then smiled and explained everything.” The angry employee explained that he had been putting “extra cream” in Ms. Moore’s coffee,  five days a week and over many years.After his confession, his colleagues called the police and Mr. Williams was arrested on the site.A total of 910 criminal charges has been filed against him, including 860 charges of sexual assault. If found guilty on all charges, he could face up to 1070 years in prison.Newark Police Chief Barry Connell says the accused confessed more than 800 crimes, making him the most prolific sexual offender in American history.Lewis William’s motivations when he committed his crimes remain unclear, but there certainly was some animosity between him and his boss.Some of his colleagues have told reporters that he was deeply misogynic and found it humiliating to take orders from a woman all day.Some other employees, however, have suggested that Ms. Moore was often “aggressive, dominating and verbally abusive” with the accused and he may have acted as some sort of “self-defense”.	1.0

Two Navy ships launched 59 Tomahawk missiles into Syria, which destroyed roughly 20% of its operational aircraft and a Green Beans Coffee shop being used by the Russian army.Soon after the strikes, some in the Trump White House began calling for regime change in Syria. Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters that peace in Syria “could not be achieved” with Assad remaining in power.Though US military officials have struggled in recent months with a plan for removing Assad, United Airlines cleared its final hurdle for the military’s request for proposal on Monday, when it ordered police officers to forcibly remove a passenger from a flight that was overbooked.Monday’s test run was “more successful than we could have hoped,” said Charlie Hobart, a spokesman for United.United will be sending one of its aircraft to Damascus sometime next week, where it will land and carry out the plan called for in the contract.It’s not yet clear whether United employees will actually carry out the forcible removal of Assad. One source said it’s possible the company may subcontract that portion of the work requirement to the Chicago Police Department, Wells Fargo, or Comcast.Recommended For You:	1.0
https://www.snopes.com/ufo-portal-cern/	FALSE: UFO Over CERN	false	['porta', ' section 51', ' ufo', ' video', ' viral videos']	http://www.section51-ufo.com/	http://www.section51-ufo.com/2015/12/ufo-entering-interdimensional-portal-over-geneva-switzerland-dec-2015.html	2016/01/08	UFO entering Interdimensional Portal over Geneva SWITZERLAND - Dec 2015 !!!December 7 2015December 2015 - Geneva, Switzerland. US tourists filmed UFO/strange orb entering Interdimensional Portal in the sky of Geneva, just over CERN area.The CERN project site is located in Geneva, Switzerland. The CERN functions as a Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the largest and most powerful particle accelerator in the World. A collider is the basic tool of particle physics. You take a stream of particles, accelerate them to really high kinetic energy levels, and initiate a collision to slam them into a target. Depending intensity of the experiment, all sorts of peculiar things can happen.As of in 2015, CERN reached levels of double potency over the 10 Tev barrier of dark matter – the theoretical minimal energy of formation of a ‘bag of strangelets’ and ‘micro-black holes’.More people have become more aware of the CERN project aggressive ambitions to explore the unknown ‘dark universe” many have pointed to signs that have people troubled if not terrified by the parade of symbolism used at the CERN facility itself. At CERN headquarters a symbol of Shiva, the (Hindu God of Destruction) dancing the cosmic dance of death and destruction can be clearly seen at the CERN facility. Is this a Symbolic declaration of CERN’s ultimate intention to bring on a new age of destruction to this planet?“The men who would play God, in searching for the God particle, are truly going to find more than they bargained for as they open the gates of hell” Stephen Quayle warns, “they will find inter-dimensional beings who have a taste for human flesh and humanities destruction. Most scientists, in lacking an understanding of the ‘supernatural entities’ that are going to confront them, are way beyond their ability to comprehend, let alone control, the forces of Pandora’s box that will be released.”Yet, on September 23, 2015, the 70th year of Jubilee, at beginning of the Fall equinox, and after the passage of 70 generations since the great flood that enveloped the whole planet CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC) research facility will initiate a monumental step into the unknown.A massive portal constructed by leading world scientists will be prepared to cause a much more intense particle collision that will rival the moment of the “big bang.” As a result a possible gateway for “dark matter” or alternate inter-dimensions can be perhaps initiated by CERN’s intense particle collision capability. This activity may indeed usher in a new age for all humanity and even this planet.Therefore, despite concerns and warnings from other leading science and theological experts a transcending portal will be left wide open and we have no way of knowing what will come forth from this massive particle collision induced gateway. In regards to the acknowledged revitalization of the CERN project mission to open an inter-dimensional portal many have become concerned, some fearful, others filled with curious intrigue over this date of September 23, 2015. However, only time will tell the significant impact 9/23 will have on humanity or on this planet.Therefore, As Sergio Bertolucci clearly stated publicly CERN is meant to open a gateway for “dark matter” and usher in the possibility of beings from alternate dimensions to emerge from it. These recent revelations about the CERN developments prove to us the scientific community is no longer able to explain ‘reality’ without looking at the ‘supernatural’.Hence, with this pronouncement of CERN’s pending capability to serve as a portal or doorway for “dark matter” humanity must buckle their seat belts for the new age to come by this imposing dabble with darkness.“For as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man” (Matt. 24: 37)Moreover, serious scientists regularly discuss the possibility of other dimensions and “wormholes” in books and on scientific documentaries for TV. In the bestselling book Hyperspace Michio Kaku refers to Flight 19 and the Bermuda Triangle :“Ever since Flight 19, a group of U.S. military torpedo bombers, vanished in the Caribbean 30 years ago, mystery writers too have used higher dimensions as a convenient solution to the puzzle of the Bermuda Triangle, or Devil’s Triangle. Some have conjectured that airplanes and ships disappearing in the Bermuda Triangle actually entered some sort of passageway to another world.”Could UFOS use interdimensional portals opening up above earth ?Watch the VIDEO HERE !Subscribe to Section 51 !

For years we have received complaints from concerned parents saying that they didn’t want their children to be subjected to tattoos so this decision has been a longtime coming. We still value tattooed customers, we just want them to cover up before experiencing the Happiest Place on Earth.”Reactions on social media have, as one would expect, been very strong.“I used to bring my family to Disney every year!” Travis Barker tweeted this morning. “Now we will never go there again!!!! #knottsberryfarm4lyfe”Legally, Disney has the right to refuse entry to anyone they please because the parks are their private property. “While we respect individuals’ freedom of expression through tattoos, we do not think that ink has any place in the Magic Kingdom,” Engañar told Inked. “For those who didn’t bring long sleeves or have neck tattoos we opened gift shops in front of our gates so that they can buy a Disney sweatshirt or scarf to cover their tattoos up before entering our theme parks.”For years it has been rumored that Disney CEO Bob Iger has despised tattoos, not just for the aesthetic quality, but because of tattoo artists making money for inking Disney logos and characters without compensating his corporation.“Ownership of trademarks in this country means that nobody can profit off of your intellectual property,” he wrote in an internal memo that was leaked to Breitbart.com in 2014. “But I have seen thousands of Disney tattoos on patrons of our theme parks and I haven’t seen one dime coming from any of those tattoos. It is like we are being mocked in our own house.”Other than tattoos, Disney has also banned facial piercings other than earrings and nose studs. That means no lip, eyebrow, septum or dimple piercings. We asked Engañar if nose rings and ear plugs/tunnels were allowed but she didn’t understand what those were, so she said she wanted to “look into it.”Last year, Disney banned selfie sticks and hoverboards, but this is the first time the parks have restricted any form of body art or permanent cosmetics. We at Inked applauded Walt Disney World and Resort for backing the Florida Competitive Workforce Act which pushed for LGBT rights in the workplace but we strongly believe that the banning of visible tattoos is a severe discriminatory practice.Sadly, the parks are also removing seven of the pirates from their popular Pirates of the Caribbean ride because they have tattoos. “This is a zero tolerance policy beginning today, April 1st,” Engañar said. “Not even Johnny Depp will be allowed into our parks with short sleeves.”Available at INKEDSHOP.COM : Women’s Inked Logo V-Neck T-ShirtAnnounced today, Disney theme parks, including Walt Disney World Florida and Disneyland in Anaheim, are banning admittance to anyone with visible tattoos.

My name is Dwayne Johnson. Many of you may know me better as The Rock.I am running for the President of the United States.I know that this may sound like a joke to many of you. But it’s not. I am throwing my hat in the ring for 2020. I am not running against Donald Trump. I am not running against whatever candidate the Democrats field. I am not running against anyone. I am running for the country. As an independent. I am running on a simple platform of compassion and civility.You may ask why someone who has never publicly expressed a political opinion is running for office, and I will tell you that is exactly why I am running for the Presidency. I do not owe any obligation to either party, so I do not need to feel beholden to either of their platforms or their ideologies. Mine, again, is a simple platform based on civility and compassion. It is based on a desire to lift everyone up — rich, poor, young, old, black, white, American born or foreign born, gay, straight or transgender — to bring us together again, to make this country whole.The fact that I have expressed so few political opinions I hope will help me in this effort because it is my hope not to advocate for the extreme positions of either party, but to find a middle ground between them both. It used to be possible to find some common ground, for each side to listen to each other, negotiate, and find a place in the middle that leaves everyone happy enough. I am running for the 70 percent of this country who wants to get along, who is willing to give a little to get a little. Who is nostalgic for dinnertime conversations that revolve around workdays or school, dance recitals, little league games, movies, TV shows, worship services, and celebrity gossip, instead of eating dinner fraught with anxiety about what’s going on in the news.I am someone who has worked successfully with people from both sides of the political spectrum and who, I believe, has gained the respect of people from all political stripes. I’ve been a popular college football player. I’ve been a popular professional wrestler, and I have been a popular actor, but I have also been careful never to let my ego get in the way. I have had a lot of box office hits, and I have had a lot of box office bombs, but I have never been defined by ratings, by the number of people who go see my movies, or by the crowds that came out to see me during my football and wrestling careers. I am the same, big-hearted, caring person every day, whether Hercules makes $10 million at the box office, or whether Fast & Furious 10 makes $100 million.There is one position where I will not bend, however, and that’s where it concerns compassion for everyone, from immigrants to low-income white people to the people of color in our cities, in our suburbs, and in rural America, to the people from abroad escaping poverty, famine, or brutal dictators. We live in a huge country, and there is plenty of space for everyone, and plenty of money and resources to go around, even if that means taking a little more from the extremely well off to help out the extremely unfortunate.As Commander in Chief, I will refashion foreign policy to align with my own personality: I will use my strength and might of our military to serve the big heart of the American public. It’s important that we stand up for the little guy, but that in doing so, never become bullies ourselves. Bullying and bluster is the surest sign of insecurity and weakness, and it is not who we are. It sure as hell isn’t who I am. We have to be better than that.Some of you may be wondering why I’ve announced my intention to run for the President of the United States only 12 days into the existing administration. There’s two reasons, actually. First of all, President Trump signed papers to begin his run for 2020 on Inauguration Day, so I am already 12 days behind!More importantly, however, is my hope to use my popularity, my broad demographic appeal, and my name recognition to shift focus away from the ugly partisanship going on in D.C. right now and onto the themes on which I plan to run. I intend to hit the campaign trail immediately, and it is my hope that whatever cultural capital I have accrued over the years fighting Hulk Hogan or Vin Diesel is enough to attract both crowds and the media. It is also my hope that those crowds and the media might begin to absorb some of the lessons about compassion and civility that I plan to impart and apply them long before our next election rolls around.I won’t run a negative campaign, because I don’t need to. I’m Dwayne Johnson. I will never begin a sentence with, “But my opponent …” I don’t need to tear anyone down in order to make myself look bigger.God has also blessed me with a smile that has a calming effect on those around me, and I hope to put it good use over the next four years as I tour this country in an effort to bring us all back together. I want to rebuild us around a very simple idea that that a difference of opinion does not have to separate us, that within most of us, there is goodness, that we can put that goodness to use, and that we are a better country when we are united than when we let our leaders divide us.I’m not asking for your vote now. I’m just asking you to listen. Give me four years to let me convince you that I deserve your vote before you make a decision. I’ll probably regret a few of the things I saw along the way, and in a campaign this long, there will probably be a backlash, and then a backlash to the backlash, but for the first three years, anyway, I’m not here to win your vote. I’m here to offer you hope, to remind you that there’s an alternative to this current political climate waiting in the wings.  I hope that I can offer you all a light at the end of the tunnel.I am Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, and I hope to be your next President of the United States.

As a former army officer, a father and business leader, I’ve heard the arguments from all sides. And, as CEO of a 163-year-old company whose products and presence rest at the intersection of culture and community in more than 110 countries around the world, I feel a tremendous responsibility to share our position on the issue, now, at a time when clarity is paramount. Providing a safe environment to work and shop is a top priority for us at Levi Strauss & Co. That imperative is quickly challenged, however, when a weapon is carried into one of our stores. Recently, we had an incident in one of our stores where a gun inadvertently went off, injuring the customer who was carrying it.So, while we understand the heartfelt and strongly-held opinions on both sides of the gun debate, it is with the safety and security of our employees and customers in mind that we respectfully ask people not to bring firearms into our stores, offices or facilities, even in states where it’s permitted by law. Of course, authorized members of law enforcement are an exception.With stores in Paris, Nice and Orlando, and the company’s European headquarters in Brussels, I’ve thought more about safety in the past year than in the previous three decades of my career because of how ‘close to home’ so many incidents with guns have come to impacting people working for this company.We operate in hundreds of stores across every state in the U.S., and laws are different in each one. We know that the presence of firearms in our stores creates an unsettling environment for many of our employees and customers. We also know that trying to enforce a ban could potentially undermine the purpose of the ban itself: safety. With that in mind we’ve made this decision as a business – a request not a mandate – and we sincerely hope responsible gun owners will respect our position. It boils down to this: you shouldn’t have to be concerned about your safety while shopping for clothes or trying on a pair of jeans. Simply put, firearms don't belong in either of those settings. In the end, I believe we have an obligation to our employees and customers to ensure a safe environment and keeping firearms out of our stores and offices will get us one step closer to achieving that reality.  Sincerely,President and Chief Executive Officer, Levi Strauss & Co.FollowFollowingUnfollowChip Bergh	1.0

However, the most powerful benefit to come out of this common weed is something that medical researchers are super excited to have ""discovered"" - which is its potential to cure cancer!proverbsthirtyonewoman.blogspot.comThis potent root builds up blood and immune system- cures prostate, lung, and other cancers better than chemotherapy. According to Dr. Carolyn Hamm from the Windsor Regional Cancer Centre in Ontario, Canada, dandelion root extract was the only thing that helped with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. This form of cancer typically affects older adults.John Di Carlo, who at the time was a 72-year old cancer patient at the hospital, was sent home to live out his final days after all efforts failed to treat his leukemia. He told CBC News that he was advised to drink dandelion root tea as a last ditch effort. Perhaps it should have been the first option offered in his treatment plan, as his cancer went into remission only four months later! His doctors attributed this to the dandelion tea that he drank.Screenshot via YouTubeRecent studies have shown that dandelion root extract can work very quickly on cancer cells, as was evidenced in Di Carlo's case. Within 48 hours of coming into contact with the extract, cancerous cells begin to disintegrate. The body happily replaces these with healthy new cells.Further studies have concluded that the extract also has anti-cancer benefits for other types of cancer, including breast, colon, prostate, liver, and lung cancer! Dandelion root tea may not taste as pleasant as other teas, but it's certainly more pleasant than living with the side effects of chemotherapy or radiation treatments.Traditional cancer therapies harm the immune system by killing all cells, even the healthy ones. Dandelion root has the opposite effect - it actually helps boost your immune system and only targets the unhealthy cells. It's definitely a win-win situation!Dr. Hamm warns, however, that dandelion root extract can negatively impact the effects of chemotherapy. It's always best to consult with your doctor, and let them know any and all supplements or foods that you are consuming on a regular basis.Screenshot via YouTubeEven if you don't have cancer, eating the greens or drinking dandelion tea can still give you great health! For example, the roots and stems of dandelion can help fight diabetes. It does this by stimulating the pancreas to produce insulin, which in turn stabilizes the spikes in blood sugar levels.If you suffer from digestive issues or need to get rid of toxins, dandelion tea may be just what the herbal medicine doctor ordered! The liver aids the digestive system by producing bile, and it also filters the blood of chemicals and other impurities. According to Dr. Axe , the vitamins and minerals found in dandelions can help cleanse the liver and keep it in tip top shape. So by supporting your liver, you are actually creating better health!Screenshot via YouTubeDandelions are also high in antioxidants and vitamin C, which is crucial to helping your body fight off infections, such as the bacteria that cause urinary tract infections. If you suffer from frequent bouts of UTI, drinking dandelion tea on a daily basis may prevent it from happening ever again.Dandelion greens are bitter, but completely edible - as long as you get it from an area that hasn't been sprayed with chemicals. The greens are rich in fiber, which is great for intestinal health! High fiber diets have also been shown to reduce the risk of obesity, heart disease, and irritable bowel syndrome.The greens are also high in vitamin A - just one cup contains 100% of your recommended daily allowance. Vitamin A is critical for maintaining healthy vision, and it can also prevent premature aging of the skin.Since you probably aren't likely to eat an entire cup of bitter greens on its own, you can incorporate it into a morning smoothie. Just blend it up with your favorite fruit, which will offset the bitter taste.Screenshot via YouTubeSponsoredSECURITY WARNING: Please treat the URL above as you would your password and do not share it with anyone.

https://www.snopes.com/queen-elizabeth-remove-obamas-guest-list/	Did Queen Elizabeth Remove the Obamas from Royal Wedding Guest List?	false	['barack obama', ' fake news', ' just news usa', ' michelle obama', ' queen elizabeth', ' royal wedding', ' your news wire', ' yournewswire.com']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/1cJLE	2017/12/06	Queen Just Gave Michelle Royal Beatdown After She Tried To Sneak A Spot On Wedding Guest ListPosted on Author Jordan Hill  Comment(0)For eight years, Michelle Obama genuinely thought she was a queen and expected to be treated like one. Now that she’s a regular citizen, she’s having a hard time of letting go of her former status as the (failed) first lady and keeps trying to push her way into every major social scene where she doesn’t belong and is apparently not invited.When she heard the news that Prince Harry was marrying a black American girl, she assumed it was her place to be on that guest list, which has to be approved by the Queen of England herself. Michelle made a desperation move to sneak a spot on that exclusive guest list and as soon as the real queen found out what the wannabe royalty did, she delivered a brutal beatdown that was definitely deserved.As soon as the big news about the royal engagement of Prince Harry and an American actress Meghan Markle was announced, the Obamas saw an opportunity to edge their way into the elites, like a couple of desperate kids trying to hang with the popular crowd at school. Barack immediately got on social media to beat President Trump to the congratulatory punch. He has a lot more time on his hands than the Commander-in-Chief who is busy cleaning up his mess.Barack practically stalked the prince on Twitter and made a post within seconds of the news coming out, which perhaps had an undertone of letting the royals know that he and Michelle were available that day to attend.The Obamas know what they are doing when it comes to getting attention on themselves and this post was no exception. It garnered a whopping 1 million “likes” on it which both he and Michelle were likely elated about since the royal family was likely sure to see it.The exposure of this post sparked rumors that the Obamas would likely be added to the guest list in the current president and first lady’s place, the Independent reported. While Barack was making desperate tweets to secretly get on the guestlist, Michelle was doing something worse to shove the Trumps aside and ensure her spot, even though the honor is typically reserved for the current president and first lady.Michelle has been making the speaking engagement rounds lately to rack in hundreds of thousands of dollars to trash Trump. Her recent trip to Canada was no exception as she combined it with a hidden mission of getting to the royal wedding.The former first lady had been invited as the keynote speaker in addressing the “Economic Club of Toronto,” when she deviated from her planned remarks to double down on her and Barack’s desperate attempt to kiss up to the Queen of England.According to Page Six, Michelle took the opportunity to make fun of President Trump then immediately gushed over the queen. Both conversation deviations had no place in an event like this, but for calculated Michelle, it has a passive-aggressive purpose of saying that Trump wasn’t fit for her guest list, but since she loves the queen so much, she should get a spot.“After being introduced by Canada’s first lady, Sophie Trudeau, Obama told the crowd that it is ‘never a good idea’ to put your first thought in the morning on social media, and never a good idea to ‘tweet from bed,’ which appears to be one of the president’s favorite pastimes, presuming that he is actually in bed when he tweets at 3 a.m,” Page Six reported.“Going on about effective communication, and the importance of doing drafts, Obama went on, ‘Then you need to edit and spell-check it.’ The 45-minute conversation, hosted by the Economic Club of Toronto, flowed into a bunch of amusing side stories, including her memories of being awestruck when meeting Queen Elizabeth of England.”“’What do you do with the queen? I touched her. She touched me first,’ she said, adding that her dream dinner guest would be Jesus, whom she’d serve pizza.”It’s well known that the respect, proper etiquette, and holding a high-level of decorum is important to the royal family and by painting a picture that Trump can’t control himself, Michelle thought she was making him look like a bad person to have at the wedding.However, the bigger motive in her comments was to cover up her actual faux-pas with the Queen when, not surprisingly, brash Michelle showed a complete lack of respect and protocol when she got a little too touchy with her bullying her way into a hug and pushing her toward a chair, The Guardian previously reported.The Queen felt so grossly disrespected by Michelle that she royally snubbed the former first lady after the touchy-feely offense. When she flew into London with her mother and daughters in tow, expecting an audience with Queen Elizabeth only, she received a big slap-in-the-face instead, the Globe reported. Instead of spending the day with Michelle and her family who flew in to meet with her, the Queen ditched her and went off the horse race instead.Michelle may think she’s royalty and even try to act like it, but she’s got nothing on the actual Queen of England who’s the real deal and put her in her place when she changed plans. The Queen does what she wants which hopefully means that she kicks her off the coveted guest list too.	1.0

Meteorologists and weather science experts at the National Weather Service (NWS) say that there is a 99% chance that the we will start to see a massive cold-front sooner in the year than has ever happened, which will produce not just record-breaking snowfall, but according to Dr. Boris Scvediok, a doctor of global weather sciences, record shattering snow storms across the board, affecting the entire United States.“For the sake of comparison to the past winter, lets say that your area received a total of twenty inches of accumulative snow for the season. Because this year the snowfall is predicted to start by the end of September or the beginning of October, you can expect to multiply that number by up to five, ten, maybe even twenty times in some areas. In the worst zones, you could see 50 times the amount of snow you’ve had in the past. This is the type of winter the American public needs to prepare for. Several meteorologists are saying not to buy into what the models are showing. I can tell you from forty years of scientific weather research, they are doing you a disservice,” Dr. Scvediok told the Associated Press on Friday. “The Northeast, Ohio Valley, and Midwestern states will definitely get hit the hardest.”Edward F. Blankenbaker, Senior Administrator of Meteorologists, also told the media that this will be a once-in-a-lifetime kind of snowy winter.“Pretty much everyone will see snow like they never have in their lives. Most younger people don’t even know what an actual blizzard looks like, but by the end of March, they will be seasoned survivalists,” Blankenbaker said. “Everyone needs to make sure they have their weather emergency kits prepared and ready to go. There will undoubtably be mass power outages, which along with freezing temperatures and enough snowfall to immobilize entire cities, will most likely, and unfortunately, be a very dangerous recipe. Safety always comes first and the time to prepare is right now.”Thanks for the feedback! UndoWhat was wrong with this ad?InappropriateThanks for the feedback!

FDA spokesperson Rebecca Miller suggests alternatives in preparation of the coming months.“We are encouraging that you go out and purchase bulk amounts of dry, powdered milk which can be stored in your cupboards. This will prevent frantic trips to grocery stores and super markets as the onslaught of storms begin to fall upon your respected region.” Miller said. “As far as bread, we suggest you buy as much as you can efficiently store in your freezer. Bread can be frozen and thawed without compromising the integrity of its quality. Preparations such as these are crucial and the fact that technology has brought us to a time and place in which such events can be predicted is quite remarkable. So stock up on your powdered milk and fill your freezer with loaves of bread, because once the blankets of snow begin to fall, brave souls will confront the elements to raid stores of these products like some sort of scavenger hunt. Don’t be a part of the Snowpocolypse, it’s a dangerous battlefield of crazed shopping winter bitten weather zombies.”Stock up! Prices could more than triple in some locationsPublic safety organizations also encourage the masses to prepare themselves by obtaining proper necessities. James Satterfield from the National Fire and Safety Advisory Board says preparation can save lives. “Don’t wait until temperatures plummet into a freeze; obtain cold weather clothing and footwear, including wool thermal socks. It is also crucial to have plenty of batteries, candles, weather radios, you name it. Get prepared, it’s coming.” Satterfield stated. “First and foremost, make sure you have an effective plan in place to make sure you have plenty of bread and milk.”Dr. Scvediok says to be prepared for a storm that could come as early as the end of September, and plan for the entire winter season, which this year, he says, will more than likely spread into next June. 	1.0

ANNOUNCER: Starting right now on ABC THIS WEEK, Trump firestorm -- what he's saying now that has some Republicans demanding he drop out. Did he just go too far? Donald Trump is here live to respond. And terror in Tennessee -- the race this morning to find out more about the gunman and new details about his trip overseas and his troubled family life. Did authorities miss any warning signs? Plus, nuclear reaction -- Israel calls it a ""historic mistake."" John Kerry is here to defend the deal. From ABC News, THIS WEEK WITH GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS begins now. MARTHA RADDATZ, ABC HOST: Good morning. I'm Martha Raddatz. So many stories developing right as we come on the air. But we start off with Donald Trump's latest campaign firestorm shocking up the 2016 race. His new comments about Vietnam veteran John McCain's war record sparking a bipartisan backlash. Donald Trump will join us live momentarily. First, ABC's Cecilia Vega on the new uproar. CECILIA VEGA, ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Donald Trump is at it again, unleashing his latest political firestorm on a new target -- this time, John McCain. DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He's not a war hero. VEGA: Trump in Iowa going directly after the Arizona senator and former Navy fighter pilot who spent five-and-a-half years as a POW during the Vietnam War. TRUMP: He is a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren't captured, OK, I hate to tell you. VEGA: And the reaction from fellow Republicans, fast and fierce. Nearly every GOP challenger running for the White House firing back. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When it comes to attacking an American hero, I'm going to call it out. I denounce Donald Trump for that. GOV. RICK PERRY (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I was highly offended what Donald Trump said about John McCain and his years of sacrifice. VEGA: Democrats pouncing, too. HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: There's nothing funny about the hate he is spewing, the insults he's directed at a genuine war hero. VEGA: Senator McCain so far staying silent, but his daughter Meghan took to Twitter, saying she is ""horrified, designated. There are no words."" This is just the latest controversy for the brash billionaire. TRUMP: They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists and some, I assume, are good people. VEGA: McCain saying recently those fiery comments on Mexico fired up the crazies. That statement apparently igniting this now very public feud. But the controversies don't seem to be hurting ""the Donald."" The latest Fox News Poll showing Trump surging to the head of the pack and overnight Trump doubling down, saying once again that he will not apologize, writing, ""I am not a fan of John McCain because he has done so little for our veterans."" VEGA: And even the Republican National Committee lashed out at Trump, saying, quote, ""There is no place in our party or our country for comments that disparage those who have served honorably."" Some now predicting, Martha, this could be the beginning of the end for Trump's candidacy. RADDATZ: Thanks very much, Cecilia. And let’s get straight to Donald Trump who joins us right now on the phone for his first interview since those controversial comments. Thanks for joining us, Mr. Trump. DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Good morning. RADDATZ: Do you owe John McCain an apology? TRUMP: No, not at all. Actually, if you look at Sharyl Attkisson’s report last night, four times she said I said perfectly, I said whatever it was, and it was absolutely fine. And she thought the press was covering me very -- very, very unfairly. And she stated that strongly. And I respect her as a reporter. And somebody that a lot of other people respect. Also and very importantly I got a standing ovation, the biggest ovation they had all weekend, by far. When I left the room, it was a total standing ovation. It was wonderful to see. Nobody was insulted. What happened is, later on, the Republican candidates, some of whom are registering 1 percent and zero, and they’re very upset that I’m leading the polls by actually a nice margin, they’re extremely upset and they were extremely when the Nevada numbers just came out and they’re through the roof too. RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, I want to -- let’s go back to this issue of John McCain, and you’re talking about the Sharyl Attkisson piece. You said he’s a war hero because he was captured, I believe perhaps he’s a war hero. I want to read you a short bio of John McCain. He was shot down in 1967 on his 23rdd bombing mission over North Vietnam. He fractured both arms and a leg when he ejected and nearly drowned when he parachuted into a lake. He was pulled out by North Vietnamese, who crushed his shoulder with a rifle and bayoneted him. He was beaten, tortured, and interrogated. He spent five and a half years a POW. The North Vietnamese offered McCain early release for propaganda purposes. He refused until every man taken before him was released. He cannot raise his arms above his head to this day because of his wartime injuries. You do not think that is a war hero, captured or not? TRUMP: I didn't say anything differently. And if you read -- and if you watch and take a look at what you have, I said nothing differently. I'm very disappointed in John McCain because the vets are horribly treated in this country. I'm fight for the vets. I've done a lot for the vets. And the vets -- I've been going around to the campaign trail. They're treated like third-class citizens. He's done nothing to help the vets. And I will tell you, they are living in hell. RADDATZ: You -- let me tell you this, what the national commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, John Stroud (ph), said about your comments. ""For someone who never served a day in uniform to criticize the service and sacrifice of a combat-wounded veteran is despicable."" The founder and CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, Paul Reikopf (ph), ""an insult to everyone who has ever worn the uniform and to all Americans and an attack on one veteran's service is an attack on us all."" They apparently think you were criticizing Mr. McCain and saying he was not a war hero. TRUMP: Well, maybe they don't speak to the same vets that I speak to. But I go all over the country and I speak to vets all the time. And they're absolutely having miserable times. It takes them six, seven days just to get into waiting in a reception room, just trying to get in to see a doctor. They're treated horribly. TRUMP: -- and it's a scandal. RADDATZ: There is -- Mr. Trump, I have covered the veterans issues for many, many years. Indeed, there are big troubles in the Veterans Administration. TRUMP: -- the veterans except talk. And by the way, this all started, Martha, when we had thousands and thousands of people in Phoenix, Arizona, and John -- who, by the way, are devastated by illegal immigration, something I'm very proud to have brought to the forefront. We had thousands of people and he said they're all crazies. He called them crazies. And frankly, I think he owes them an apology. RADDATZ: Let me talk about your language about him being captured. You say you prefer those who aren't captured. What could John McCain have done not to be captured? TRUMP: Well, I do say this. People that fought hard and weren't captured and went through a lot, they get no credit. Nobody even talks about them. They're like forgotten. And I think that's a shame, if you want to know the truth. People that were not captured that went in and fought, nobody talks about them. Those are heroes also. RADDATZ: I think people do talk about those people as well. TRUMP: I don't think so. RADDATZ: -- what did you mean you -- what did you mean you prefer those who aren't captured? TRUMP: I want to give them credit because, frankly, they don't get the credit. John McCain gets credit. He was elected a senator, et cetera, et cetera, and we'll give him all the credit. And as in the report, it said, from Sharyl Attkisson, four times, I said he is a hero. But you know, people choose little selective like you try to do. People choose little selective pieces. If you read what I say or if you watch what I say, which is even better, you'll say that there was nothing wrong. But the people that weren't captured are also heroes, Martha. RADDATZ: I want to talk about you and your deferment. How many deferments did you actually get? And what were they for? I believe you had student deferments and then a medical deferment. TRUMP: I had student deferments, like many other people had, during the war or around the time of the war. I had a minor medical deferment for feet, for a bone spur of the foot, which was minor. I was then entered into the draft because if I would have gotten a different number, I could have been drafted. I was fortunate, in a sense, because I was not a believer in the Vietnam War. That was another war that was a disaster for this country. Lives and money and it’s disgraceful what happened with the Vietnam War. I was not a fan of the Vietnam War. But I was entered into the draft and I got a very, very high draft number. RADDATZ: That wasn’t until 1969. RADDATZ: The lottery wasn’t until 1969? TRUMP: That’s right. TRUMP: Excuse me. Excuse me. I was entered into the lottery, the draft lottery. If I would have gotten a low number, I would have been drafted. I would have proudly served. But I got a number, I think it was 356. That’s right at the very end. And they didn’t get -- I don’t believe -- past even 300, so I was -- I was not chosen because of the fact that I had a very high lottery number. RADDATZ: You -- there seems to be a pattern, Mr. Trump. When you’re criticized or attacked, you often respond with name-calling, using terms like “dummy”, “loser”, “total losers” on Twitter and elsewhere. You even demean some people’s physical appearance. Is that something you would continue doing if you were president? Isn’t that language beneath the office of the president? TRUMP: Oh, I don’t think -- look, when people attack me, I let them have it back. You say physical appearance. You know, it’s my hair but people are constantly attacking my hair. I don’t see you coming to my defense. I’m -- my hair is just fine, but I don’t see you coming to my defense. But if I say something about somebody else. Yesterday, I mentioned somebody was saying, McCain’s a smart man. I said, really? He graduated last in his class at Annapolis, OK. So people laughed when I said it, but a lot of people don’t know that. I’m very disappointed. I understand John McCain. I’ve backed John McCain; raised, I think, $1 million for John McCain when he let us down. He ran for president and lost to Obama, let us down. I wasn’t thrilled with that. But I will say what I want to say, and maybe that’s why I’m leading in the polls because people are tired of hearing politicians and pollsters telling the politicians exactly what to say. And, believe me, this whole thing was brought up by a lot of the people that are competing against me currently that aren’t even registering in the polls because people are tired of them. RADDATZ: Have you ever said anything you regret? TRUMP: Yes, I have, on many occasions. RADDATZ: Can you tell us a few of those? Not the birther issue. RADDATZ: Not the immigrant issue. TRUMP: No, I wouldn’t do that. I wouldn’t do that, Martha. I wouldn’t do that. It’s not the appropriate time. But certainly I have said things that I could’ve held back. But not that often, surprisingly not that often, but certainly there have been occasions. RADDATZ: So let me just get this clear. You are not apologizing. And you are certainly not pulling out of the race as some of your opponents have suggested. TRUMP: Of course they’d love to have me do that because I’m leading the pack. I’m certainly not pulling out; I’m leading and I’m leading in many states. North Carolina just came in; I’m way in the lead there. Nevada, as I said, just came in. I’m way in the lead there. And, interestingly, in Nevada, I lead in Hispanics by a tremendous -- the Hispanics, I’m way into the 30s with Hispanics. Which I said, if I get the nomination, if I run for president, I will win the Hispanic vote, because I’ll be able to take jobs back from China, jobs back from Japan and Mexico, and everybody else that’s ripping us off on trade. And everybody knows that. And I will win the Hispanic vote. RADDATZ: So you think this will actually help you? This is involving veterans and you heard what I said about those veterans groups. You still think this will help you in the polls? TRUMP: I believe that I will do far more for veterans than John McCain has done for many, many years, with all talk no action. He’s on television all the time, talking, talking. Nothing gets done. You look at what’s happening to our veterans -- they’re being decimated, OK. So I will do far more for veterans than anybody. I’ll be able to build them new hospitals, I’ll be able to build them care centers. I’ll be able to help the veterans. John McCain has failed. Because all you have to do is take a look -- what you report on all the time, take a look at the scandal at the Veterans’ Administration and the disastrous conditions under which our veterans have to live. And believe me, I built, with a small group, the Vietnam Memorial in downtown Manhattan. I know what it is to help people and I know what it is to help veterans. RADDATZ: Thank you very much for joining us, Mr. Trump. Now let's just in Democratic presidential contender, former senator, and Vietnam veteran Jim Webb. who, like John McCain, attended the U.S. Naval Academy. Senator Webb, what's your reaction? JIM WEBB (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, you know, I... RADDATZ: You don't know where to start. WEBB: That's a lot to react to in a quick minute or two. But first of all, I believe if Donald Trump had taken the opportunity to serve our country, could have volunteered like a lot of people did, he would have a different feeling about these kinds of things that he's saying in his vituperative personal attacks. It's one thing to talk about issues, but when you're talking about military service you're talking about duty and honor and dignity. And actually the comments that he made a few weeks ago about Mexican-Americans insulted a lot of our veterans. I have a couple of Mexican-American marine veterans who were in my unit in Vietnam who were really inflamed with these comments. One of them wrote a letter to Mr. Trump and said any time you want, come back and talk to us about military service. Oh, you didn't go. Now, I'd known John McCain for a very long time, a great respect for him. I don't agree with him. You don't have to agree with him to understand the daily courage that it takes, and took, when people are prisoners of war undergoing uncertainties of whether they are going to come home or not -- and as you mentioned so well, how badly injured he was... RADDATZ: Just quickly on that, you heard what Mr. Trump said. I said he was a war hero because he was captured. Was he backing off a little, or will that help at all, or just make it worse? WEBB: Well, what he said was -- there's no excuse for it. And, you know, he can talk about veterans issues. We all care about veterans issues. And as I said, this goes to all veterans when they hear those sorts of things, because you're talking about the dignity of service when you say things like that. And there's no way to take away the courage, the daily courage people like John McCain faced in those years of incarceration. RADDATZ: Thanks for joining us, Senator Webb. We'll have more with you later. Plus, the roundtable weighs in on Trump's future, but now that developing story out of Tennessee, new details on the suspect in that terror attack that left five service members dead. Investigators are working 24/7 to find out everything they can about Muhammad Abdulazeez. How did he plan his rampage? Who did he meat on his recent trip to Jordan? I recently reported from that country on the effort to contain the ISIS threat and talk to numerous young men who supported the jihadist group. Now, officials want to know if the Tennessee shooter had any links to ISIS. Here is senior justice correspondent Pierre Thomas. PIERRE THOMAS, ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Right now the phones and computer of Muhammad Abdulazeez are at the FBI laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, an urgent effort underway to find clues to his motive. He was not under FBI investigation, not under surveillance, and the FBI wants to know how he was able to operate under the radar. They're looking at his travel, including the seven month trip to Jordan last year. Did he secretly go to other countries during that visit? And they want to find out if he was using online aliases to view violent propaganda or using encrypted communication to hide contacts with overseas radicals. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Law enforcement is asking is there we could have done? Is there more that we should have done? Were people aware that he was traveling to that region, were their signs that he was exhibiting in the community that were missed. THOMAS: The FBI is under tremendous pressure with terrorism investigations in all 50 states, involving hundreds of suspected radicals, many of them thought to be ISIS sympathizers. Just one week before the Chattanooga terror attack, the FBI director was sounding the alarm before congress. JAMES COMEY, DIRECTOR, FBI: I cannot see me stopping these indefinitely. THOMAS: And while we don't yet know if Abdulazeez has ties to ISIS, that’s the group that Comey fears is an eminent threat, specifically because of its unprecedented social media campaign targeting smartphones, computers and tablets. COMEY: It buzzes in their pocket. So there is a device, almost a devil on their shoulder all day long saying ""kill, kill, kill, kill."" THOMAS: A daily sophisticated multimedia campaign using all the advertising tricks. Primary ISIS focus: directives to kill U.S. military. And it's working. In recent months, at least a half dozen suspected ISIS sympathizers accused of plotting to kill U.S. soldiers here at home. In March, an Illinois national guardsman was accused of conspiring with his cousin to murder his fellow soldiers. In April, an Ohio man charged after he traveled to Syria and was allegedly directed by ISIS to kill military personnel, men like Abdulazeez in their 20s. Difference: Abdulazeez got through. For This Week, Pierre Thomas, ABC News, Washington. RADDATZ: And joining us now, Congressman Michael McCaul, chair of the homeland security committee who is calling the shooting an ISIS inspired attack. Chairman McCaul, can you tell us the latest that they've found out about Abdulazeez? REP. MICHAEL MCCAUL, (R) TEXAS: Well, the FBI is currently doing a forensics examination on his computer, his cell phone, his travels to Jordan, which is right across the border from Syria. So we have the threat of foreign fighters, but we also have the threat over the internet, which is a new sort of threat that's out there, a new generation of terrorists as you heard Director Comey talk about. These internet directives from a cyber command if you will out of Syria to activate people in the United States to attack. And what they are saying is attack military installations and attack police officers. And what we saw was one of the most deadliest attacks on American soil against our U.S. marines and an American sailor. And this is case that we're most worried about. We have followed quite a few cases. We have over 60 cases that we've rolled up ISIS followers over the last year. That's more than one per week. We have investigations into all 50 states. But what keeps us up at night are really the ones that we don't know about. And I'm afraid that this case falls into that category. RADDATZ: Well, to that point, you had a naturalized citizens, numerous trips to Jordan, which border Syria as you said, a father who is on the terrorist watch list at one time, reports of Abuse, online writing. Shouldn't alarm bells have sounded? MCCAUL: Well, 20/20 is hindsight. I commend the FBI and homeland for stopping so many terrorist plots in the United States. But we will be examining this case. I know the FBI is investigating again his travel. The father was on a watchlist, was under an investigation that was closed. We'll be looking at all those details. But you know this is, again, the new sort of threat that's out there over the internet that's very hard to stop. We have 200,000 ISIS tweets per day that hit the United States. And this is one of those threats that Director Comey talks about is getting so -- the chatter is so loud and the volume so high that it's a problem that's very hard to stop and disrupt in this country. It's something we've been warning about over the last year. And unfortunately we saw it take place in Chattanooga. And Martha, if it can happen in Chattanooga, it can happen anywhere, anytime, anyplace, and that's our biggest fear. RADDATZ: Mr. Chairman, you say 20/20 is hindsight -- or 20/20 hindsight -- but Tamerlan Tsarnaev had a background that should have raised alarms as well. And haven't we taken more measures since the Boston bombing to try to stop or track someone like this? MCCAUL: Of course. And I was one of the biggest critics of that -- the way that was handled, that particular case that we saw fall through the cracks. You know, this is one we'll be conducting oversight and examining what happened. But again, when we're stopping like we did the 4th of July plot that was imminent to blow up military at 4th of July parades, when we stopped at Garland, we stopped at -- we have again arrested -- there were 60 ISIS over the last year. Again, that's more than one per week. It's -- this is a very difficult counterterrorism challenge in the United States. And this is -- I met with the generals that conduct the war on terror. And you know what, I think we need to take the fight over there a little stronger. RADDATZ: -- I'm going to have to let you wrap up there, Chairman McCaul. Thank you very much for joining us. We'll be right back to look at these soft targets, like military recruiting centers, even cruise ships and shopping malls. Are we doing enough to protect them? RADDATZ (voice-over): Back in just a moment with a look at those soft targets. How can we protect them against attack? RADDATZ: A look at the growing memorial in Tennessee outside the recruiting center that was one of the sites of that horrific shooting rampage this week. This morning officials beefing up security at military locations nationwide. The strikes are a chilling remainder of just how many places are vulnerable to terror. Let's talk about that now with former FBI special agent Brad Garrett and retired general and former commander of U.S. Africa Command, Carter Ham. Carter Ham, you, of course, served in Iraq as well and you certainly looked at the issues of force protection there. But you have advised the Pentagon on how to protect our service members as part of your investigation into the Ft. Hood massacre. What do you think should happen now? GEN. CARTER HAM, FMR. CMDR., AFRICOM: I think the right thing to do now is to do a comprehensive approach. There are, as you mentioned, Martha, thousands of U.S. military facilities that are embedded in the fabric of our society around the country. And it's also noteworthy that, very sadly, the four Marines and the Navy petty officer who were killed were on a federal installation, not in the civilian sector. So how the shooter was able to gain access into that facility, I think, certainly merits further study. RADDATZ: And one of the suggestions -- and some people are doing it now for National Guard members -- is to arm them. I think people don't realize sometimes that on these bases people aren't really armed except for some security people. Do you think they should be armed? Do you think they should be armed, Brad? GARRETT: I think it's premature. It should be looked at. I know some state governors within their proper authority have directed that some of the National Guard members who are in facilities, recruiting facilities and the like, be armed. That's not the case for federal recruiting stations. And there are matters of law and history that have to get involved. But I think there are also other measures that can be taken, such as hardening the facilities, bulletproof glass in doors and the other. And I would also mention that the federal, state and local law enforcement relationship with these military entities is very, very sound. And if there is an indication of increased threat, they're very quick to make sure that these sites are aware of that threat. RADDATZ: And -- and Brad Garrett, they can harden those facilities. They can look at that closely. But it seems like almost everything else is a soft target. GARRETT: Basically the world, Martha, is a soft target, except for these little bitty pockets. You can't really take a recruiting center and target harden it, because you then take away what it's there for, which is for us to walk in and decide if we want to join the military. So a lot of this has -- we have to face the reality that some of us are just going to be vulnerable doing what we do day in and day out. Now, having said that... RADDATZ: And just quickly, because I asked you for -- do you think they should arm people at these recruiting stations? GARRETT: I think we should not get in a big hurry to do that. You're talking about arming folks that are being -- going to be walking around in the civilian population. I see big issues with that. RADDATZ: And -- and just very quickly, sum up what you think we can do, what we can do about soft targets. GARRETT: The only thing you can do, Martha, about soft targets, is improve your intelligence. In other words, the shooting that happened in Chattanooga, we didn't know about. Can that happen again? Of course it can. But this has really got to be driven by what do we know in advance, because we're not going to lock down every facility, every mall in the country. And I know we'll have both of you back to talk about this a lot in the future. Next, inside the historic Iran nuclear deal and the battle ahead on Capitol Hill. John Kerry and Israel's prime minister weighing in right here. Plus, that wild week on the 2016 campaign trail. It's not just about Donald Trump. RADDATZ: Part of the global reaction to the landmark nuclear deal with Iran, celebrations in Tehran earlier this week. I was there when the momentous deal was reached. We saw lots of joy and hope among the Iranian people, but there is also serious fear and concern here at home and around the world about that agreement. A top critic, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, joins us shortly. First, chief White House correspondent Jon Karl with America's lead negotiators, secretary of State John Kerry and Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz. JONATHAN KARL, ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Could this be the beginning of a -- of a major change, though, in U.S.-Iran relations? I mean we've (INAUDIBLE)... JOHN KERRY, SECRETARY OF STATE: Well, there's no way to tell that. I mean it was not the purpose of the negotiations about a nuclear program. But we're prepared to test whether or not they're prepared to change their relationship in the region. And we certainly -- I think it would be diplomatic malpractice if we didn't keep our -- our doors open to possibilities. KARL: This deal is going before the U.N. Security Council on Monday. You've heard some harsh criticism about that from Congress. Bob Corker, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said this is an affront to the American people. Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the committee said this is presumptuous, to go to the U.N. before Congress. Why are you going to the U.N. before you're going to the U.S. Congress with this deal? KERRY: Well, we're not. What we did was negotiate with our P5-plus-1 partners, who are not subject to the Congress, that it cannot be implemented until after Congress has had a chance to vote. KARL: But the bottom line is the U.N. is going to vote on this before the Congress is going to vote on this. KERRY: Well, they have a right to do that, honestly. It's presumptuous of some people to suspect that France, Russia, China, Germany, Britain ought to do what the congress tells them to do. They have a right to have a vote. But we prevailed on them to delay the implementation of that vote out of respect for our congress so we wouldn't be jamming them. KARL: One of the most controversial provisions here is that in terms of these covert sites, Iran can delay for 24 days before inspectors get in there. You, Mr. Secretary, have said that there would be anywhere/anytime inspections. I mean, 24 days is not anywhere/anytime. MONIZ: It was anytime/anywhere in the sense of a well defined process that would have a well defined conclusion in time. Three weeks for a process of this type is reasonable. Most important, we are very confident in our ability to detect the vestiges of any nuclear work beyond 24 days. KARL: So, even though they have nearly a month, they can't clean up what they're doing and hide what they're doing? MONIZ: Yes, there had been various analogies to throwing things down toilets, et cetera. This is not so simple with nuclear materials. We have plenty of evidence of exquisite environmental sampling that will reveal the traces of nuclear work. KARL: And I want to ask you, the lifting of the arms embargo -- so you're going to unleash 100 billion dollars worth of Iranian assets, and then within five years, they're going to be able to go on the open market arms embargo lifted. This is the premier state sponsor of terrorism. KERRY: The United Nations resolution, which brought about the sanctions in the first place, said that if Iran will suspend its enrichment and come to negotiations, all the sanctions will be lifted. Now they've done more than just come to negotiations, they've actually negotiated a deal. And three of the seven nations thought they shouldn't, therefore, be held to any kind of restraint. We prevailed and insisted, no, they have to be. But we have ample other resolutions that allow us to hold them accountable for moving any weapons. President Obama is committed to doubling down on the enforcement of those measures. So I really think that a mountain is being made out of a mole hill here. RADDATZ: Now for the other side, let’s bring in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He’s called the deal “an historic mistake”. He joins us now from Israel. Prime Minister, we know you’re adamantly opposed to this deal. So, what do you do? Do you personally lobby Congress? BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTERADDATZ: Look, I think it’s very important for me as the prime minister of the one and only Jewish state to make our case against the deal that we believe endangers our security, our survival even, and the security of our -- of the Middle East and the world. I think that’s important. It’s a substantive disagreement. It should be examined on the substance. RADDATZ: I know you have concerns especially about the 24 days to allow inspectors on Iranian nuclear sites and military sites. And yet, the U.S. Secretary of Energy says the U.S. is very confident in its ability to detect nuclear work beyond 24 days. Is he wrong? NETANYAHU: Well, I think that -- I have respect for our intelligence services. They’re the best in the world -- Israel, the U.S. and the U.K. And yet, all three of us didn’t see for a long time the massive underground nuclear bunkers in Qom and in Natanz. We didn’t see the Syrian war kind of reactor, a nuclear reactor that was almost operational when we discovered. So, I have full respect for intelligence. But it’s very thin ice. You simply, you can’t have -- speak with confidence about knowing a covert path to the bomb uninspected sites because you simply don’t know. Intelligence and the best intelligence in the world, you still very thin ice. RADDATZ: What, to you, would have been an ideal agreement? NETANYAHU: Dismantle for dismantle. Dismantle Iran’s nuclear infrastructure for dismantling the sanctions. That was the original administration position and I think it was the right one. But, in fact, Iran actually gets both things. It gets to keep its nuclear infrastructure and it gets the full dismantling of sanctions in a very short time. So the hardliners in Iran are actually going to come out strong because they’re getting everything they want. They’re getting a pathway down the line, within a decade or so, to the capacity to be a threshold state with practically zero breakout time to many nuclear bombs, and billions of dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars, which they’ll siphon off to their terror and war machine. RADDATZ: Ash Cater is coming tomorrow. Is there anything he can say, the secretary of defense, that will satisfy you? NETANYAHU: You know, everybody talks about compensating Israel. I guess the question you have to ask yourself is, if this deal is supposed to make Israel and our Arab neighbors safer, why should we be consecrated -- compensated with anything. And furthermore, you know, how can you compensate a country, my country, against a terrorist regime that is sworn to our destruction and is going to get a path to nuclear bombs and billions of dollars to boot for its terror activities against us, against you, against everyone else. I think the right thing to do is not to do this bad deal. RADDATZ: Let me ask you one final question. The military option. We know you’re not going to talk about specifics, but is there really any bomb, any military action that would delay Iran building a bomb for as long as this deal does? NETANYAHU: As far as the military option, I never talk about it. RADDATZ: Mr. Prime Minister, thank you. NETANYAHU: Thank you. RADDATZ: We’re right back with Senator Jim Webb and the roundtable breaks down the new Donald Trump firestorm. WEBB: I understand how our American military works. I understand foreign policy issues. And I would assure you, by the way, that if I were your president I would have never urged an invasion of Iraq. RADDATZ: Senator Jim Webb speaking in Iowa on Friday night. That event the first time all five Democratic candidates have appeared on stage together. And Senator Webb is back with us now. I want to go to the shooting in Chattanooga. You were a marine, you saw many men die. Do you agree that recruiters should have -- I think I know you do agree that recruiters should have guns. They should be allowed to carry... WEBB: Well, they should have the means to defend themselves. And this is dramatically changed since 9/11. And there's a basic logic here: if we don't know who these shooters are going to be, and we do know that one of their targets that they're focusing on are military people in uniform, then it's just logical that we should provide them a means to defend themselves if they become under any sort of attack like this. That doesn't mean you have to turn a recruiting office into a bunker, as -- that was being discussed before, but... RADDATZ: But these are in civilian areas. I think that's the difference there. You know, they're in strip malls. They're... WEBB: Well, you know, we don't take firearms away from police officers. There should be some means for these people to defend themselves. I had a long talk with the chief of staff for the army after the Ft. Hood incident, which also was on a military base. There was not one military person in that gathering that had a firearm. I grew up in the military. Firearms were normal in the situations when I was growing up. By the time they called the police to get in there to help them, they had 13 dead people. RADDATZ: How do you see that playing out? I know one of the things we talked about with the military is they're not police officers. The MPs are police officers. WEBB: Well, like I say, it's -- this -- I'm not talking about turning these different centers and bases into fire bases. But at the same time, they should have the ability to defend themselves in some way. And the -- try and think of it the other way around. RADDATZ: I'm going to leave that to you. I want to move to the Iran deal. You say you have a lot of concerns and we're going to read it. What concerns you most? And if you were still in the Senate, would you vote against it? WEBB: Well, first, I have been a proponent of these sorts of approaches toward rogue and rogue regimes. I worked with Vietnam in terms of normalizing relations there. I led the change in Burma in terms of opening up that regime. I just have very serious concerns here. Number one is even if all of these processes worked -- and I respect the people who put them together -- at the end of 10 years, what are we going to have? Have we now given our endorsement of the fact that Iran will eventually obtain nuclear weapons? And then secondly, the process beginning now, I think, is -- we've got to be very careful in terms of how it affects the strategic balance in the region in terms of signals that we send, not just in terms of who's got how many conventional weapons. RADDATZ: And I hate to say be quick on this because it's your entire campaign. But we'll let you go campaign. How do you think your prospects look for being president? And why do you want to be president? You stayed in the Senate on term. WEBB: Well, I've had four different periods of public service in my life. And I've been able to move out of public service for a while and look at things differently. So four year -- one term in the Senate is a term and a half of a presidency. Wasn’t a short period of time. RADDATZ: So why do you want to be president? WEBB: I'm very concerned about where we're going in this country. And I think we're going to see some dramatic changes in terms of how we approach our economic fairness issues and we really need a commander in chief who understands how to deal with these issues. RADDATZ: Thank you very much for joining us, Senator Webb. RADDATZ (voice-over): Ahead, will Donald Trump keep his lead in the polls after this latest firestorm? And Obama's big sell (ph), will Congress accept the Iran nuke deal? We're back after this from our ABC stations. TRUMP: I believe that I will do far more for veterans than John McCain has done for many, many years with all talk, no action. He's on television all the time, talking, talking; nothing gets done. You look at what's happening to our veterans. They're being decimated, OK? So I will do far more for veterans than anybody. John McCain has failed. RADDATZ (voice-over): Some of Donald Trump's comments causing that new uproar. Let's bring in the roundtable. ""Weekly Standard"" editor Bill Kristol, ESPN's LZ Granderson, former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm who's the co-chair of Super PAC Priorities USA and a Hillary Clinton supporter, and ABC's chief White House correspondent, Jon Karl. And a special welcome to LZ and Governor Granholm, here for the first time as ABC News contributors. We are happy to have had you before many, many times. I want to start with our Jon Karl, however. Is this different (ph)? Is this a turning point? JONATHAN KARL, ABC NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, this is what opened the floodgates of Republicans to finally come out and condemn Donald Trump. But look, he's content to lead in the polls with 15-17 percent and I'll tell you, Martha, there are two candidates that Trump unequivocally helps in this race, one now, the other in the future. The first is Jeb Bush because he becomes the vessel for all of the anti-Bush anger in the party and it's in somebody who is clearly unelectable, will not get the nomination. And the second is Hillary Clinton. You heard him again, yesterday, say that he will not rule out running as a third-party candidate if that happens, it guarantees Hillary Clinton victory. RADDATZ: And, Bill Kristol, I think it was just yesterday you did a brief interview with ABC News, calling him older, wiser, richer Donald Trump would be better than Hillary. BILL KRISTOL, ""THE WEEKLY STANDARD"": I think he's still older and richer than Hillary Clinton. KRISTOL: Though if she gives a few more speeches maybe she'll catch up. But, no, I don't think that anymore actually. I think it's one thing, he was a controversial character who said some useful things, I think, and brought some people into the Republican tent. But he jumped the shark (ph) yesterday. KRISTOL: -- yes, seriously, no. I mean, he insulted every veteran, every -- certainly every veteran who's a POW, which is -- with these insane statements about how it's your fault that you're captured or shot down. And with total lack of respect for not just John McCain -- that I think other people made this point, Jim Webb, made this point -- for other people's military service and sacrifice. So I'm finished with Donald Trump. And I don’t think it's going to -- he'll -- and I don't think -- I don't think he'll stay up in the polls, incidentally. Republican primary voters are pro-respect the military. And he showed disrespect for the military. RADDATZ: LZ, did his explanation do anything, change anything? LZ GRANDERSON, ESPN: Explanation? I thought it was just more of a -- just furthermore branding sort of promotion. I mean, we all know he's not actually trying to be President of the United States. He's just trying to stir the pot to keep his brand out there. And that's just what he's been doing. RADDATZ: But has he gone too far this time? GRANDERSON: Well, I'm amazed that we think this is the moment that he's gone too far. I mean, he -- on television and literally (INAUDIBLE) an entire race of people. Why wasn’t that the shark that got jumped? Why did it take the attack of John McCain to get people to get so upset that Republicans start tweeting and denouncing? When he went there and said, well, I like some of the Mexicans but the rest of them are a bunch of rapists and criminals? I mean, that, to me, was a shark jumping moment. RADDATZ: And Governor, the Democrats do what? Just sit back and let this play out? JENNIFER GRANHOLM (D), FORMER GOVERNOR OF MICHIGAN: Well, I was going to say before yesterday, just put up your feet and break out the popcorn. But I do think that he really went too far. And I agree with LZ, that he had gone too far already and that this really, I think, is a signal of this sinister thread that runs through a lot of the far right and Tea Party, this feeling like those who are different are not one of us, that it's frightening for many in the sort of old, older white Americans who might be following him and who are angry, who may feel threatened by this -- by immigrants. I worry about that sinister thread. And I'll be interested to see whether, in fact, there is a -- you know, a diminution in his rankings. Because if it still stays high, then I think there's a lot more that the Republican Party has to figure out. RADDATZ: And let's look at those rankings first, Jon. We've got in the latest ABC News ""Washington Post"" poll, obviously, before these comments, Trump still had a 61 percent unfavorable rating, although his favorability has doubled since May, despite -- despite... KARL: -- your favorability is 33 percent and that is a doubling, by the way. RADDATZ: So -- so what happens going forward? In a week from now, if we took another poll, what do you think that would say? KARL: Well, I still think there is a portion of that electorate that is extremely angry. I don't doubt that it will go down a degree on this. But look what happened in the room when he made those comments. One thing he was right about in the interview he used it with him, is he did get a standing ovation. And he was enthusiastically applauded minutes after saying what he said about John McCain in that room. Now, by the way, the other thing he said is he was asked, can you tell us -- do you ever ask God for forgiveness. This was a -- this was a conservative religious right (INAUDIBLE)... RADDATZ: That was controversial. RADDATZ: In that room was... KARL: And he couldn't come up with a -- with -- well, I don't really know. I kind of leave God out of that. I think he kind of misunderstands Evangelicalism. RADDATZ: OK, Bill, we -- we also saw Scott Walker officially jump into the race this week. He's still doing well in the polls, both in Iowa and nationally. What's his vulnerability? KRISTOL: I don't -- I (INAUDIBLE)... RADDATZ: Maybe nothing? KRISTOL: Yes, I think he's a strong candidate, a Midwestern governor who governed successfully, won three times in four years in a -- in a state that President Obama carried twice in that same period. And I think that Trump will go away. I don't buy the argument that there is a huge number of un -- Jennifer wants to make it seem like this huge chunk of the Republican Party is... KRISTOL: -- vitriolic. GRANHOLM: I just think that there is... KRISTOL: It was the Democrats yesterday... GRANHOLM: -- there is a number... KRISTOL: -- who hooted at a huge left-wing convention, who hooted Bernie Sanders and O'Malley, Governor O'Malley, off the stage for not being left-wing enough. Governor O'Malley said black lives matter, white lives matter, all lives matter. Unacceptable in the Democratic Party. RADDATZ: I -- I want to move on to Iran since I just got back from Iran... RADDATZ: -- it's a particularly interesting to me. LZ, you Tweeted this week questioning Republicans like Senator Tom Cotton, who criticizing the deal. You said, ""All about 6's -- Senator Cotton, who has been in office for like six months, takes on the six nations that have been working on this Iran deal since 2006."" Is there like a 666 thing... GRANDERSON: It was (INAUDIBLE)... RADDATZ: -- going there? GRANDERSON: I just thought it was kind of curious that the number sixes kept appearing. And... GRANDERSON: And the way that the conversation continues to happen, especially domestically, I spent a couple of weeks in London. I was there for ESPN covering Wimbledon. And I can tell you that the conversation that's happening abroad in terms of this deal is totally different than the way that it's being promoted here or talked about here. Here, it's all through the lens of America. It's all through Congress, what Congress has to say. Abroad, it's about what's in it for Russia, what's in it for China, how does it impact the U.K.? It's a lot more about the breadth j the width of this deal and not just domestically. And I think that's important as we have this conversation here. This isn't about whether or not Obama negotiated a bad deal. This is about whether or not the six nations involved in the conversation found this deal to be advantageous versus the current status quo. That's the conversation we need to be having. KRISTOL: Do you think Congress doesn't have a right to say -- to weigh in? GRANDERSON: No, no, no. Part of the conversation is how Congress feels about it. But Congress isn't the leader of... KRISTOL: I'm sorry... GRANDERSON: -- the U.K., is not the leader of... KRISTOL: Well, that's right. GRANDERSON: It's not the (INAUDIBLE)... KRISTOL: So Congress should (INAUDIBLE)... GRANDERSON: -- of Russia. KRISTOL: -- on whether America... KRISTOL: -- goes along with this deal. GRANDERSON: -- for -- for America. GRANDERSON: But as Americans, we need to have a conversation about well, who else is impacted by this and what are their thoughts on this, as well, because that should influence us to have an intelligent conversation about it and not just one that's solely based upon us. RADDATZ: So let's quickly move to the Hill very quickly. Governor, do you think it -- what happens on the Hill? GRANHOLM: Well, I -- I do think that people should actually take a look at Hillary Clinton's statement on this, because this is not the end of the story. She says it's a beginning, it's a first step. There are a lot of other arrows in the diplomatic quiver to -- to constrain Iran's bad behavior in other areas. This is one thing. And the goal was to reduce Iran's ability to get the bomb and they've done that. KRISTOL: And give them $140... RADDATZ: And Jonathan Karl... KRISTOL: -- billion... RADDATZ: I've got -- I'm going to give you 10 seconds, because you know what that means. KARL: Well, I will tell you that I -- the White House thinks that they can keep this disapproval resolution from passing the Congress by getting at least 41 ""no"" votes in the Senate. That means they can hold most of the Democrats. I don't know if that's the case, but they have -- they're off to a good start. RADDATZ: And -- and what would this do to President Obama's foreign policy legacy? You've got 10 seconds. GRANHOLM: Yes. I think it is a tremendous legacy, because it shows that America can lead with allies in strategic coalitions. It doesn't have to be American unilateralism and cowboyism. RADDATZ: OK, thanks, all of you, very much. We'll keep an eye on it. We may not know the results of it for quite a long time. Finally this morning, the heroes killed in the Tennessee terror attack -- four Marines and one sailor. Some of these brave men survived wars overseas only to tragically fall here at home. We remember these remarkable Americans. RADDATZ: And please remember. That's all for us today. Thanks for sharing part of your Sunday with us. Check out ""World News Tonight."" And we'll see you back here next week."	1.0

Keith Ashdown, the spokesman and chief sloganeer for a watchdog group, had been stewing about how to describe Alaska's Gravina Island Bridge in a news release. He wanted a catchy phrase that expressed the huge cost and dubious need for the milelong span. Then, as he stood beneath a Miller Lite sign at a bar called the Hawk 'n' Dove, he had a brainstorm. ""Bridge to nowhere!"" Four years later, the phrase has done what few political slogans can do. It shaped public opinion, influenced an election and pressured Congress to change its rules. Mentioned hundreds of times in newspapers, on TV and at countless dinner tables, it became shorthand for political pork and a Congress that was out of touch. ""It was an extraordinarily powerful image,"" said Rep. Adam Putnam, R-Bartow. ""It became a metaphor for a Republican majority that had lost its way on fiscal responsibility."" Language columnist William Safire called it ""the phrase that launched a thousand editorials."" Columnist George Will wrote after the November election: ""Republicans now know where the bridge to nowhere leads: to the political wilderness."" This is the story of three words that changed American politics. 'Pillow-talk pork' Ashdown is an unlikely Washington power broker. He has never held elected office, he's not a lawyer and he rarely wears a tie. A stocky 34-year-old with a deep voice and a belly built by beer, he looks more linebacker than lobbyist. He works for Taxpayers for Common Sense, a Washington group that opposes corruption and government waste. He plays a unique role in the Washington power structure: part detective, part press agent. He gets tips about government shenanigans, verifies them, and then passes them to reporters with snappy quotes they can't resist. He described a project that helped a lawmaker's wife as ""pillow-talk pork"" and said Pentagon officials have ""spent money like Paris Hilton at a shoe sale."" Better than most in the nation's capital, Ashdown understands that the fewest words often say the most. That's why on that night at the bar in December 2002, he was determined to find just the right ones. The Golden Fleece He had learned of the Gravina Island Bridge a year earlier from an Alaskan environmentalist. He decided the $190-million bridge would be good for the Golden Fleece, a legendary award for dubious federal spending. The bridge would link the greater Ketchikan area, which has about 13,000 residents, with an island of 50 inhabitants that is home to the town's airport. It would replace a passenger ferry, but its main purpose was to encourage development on the island. ""It was really a bridge to the future of the community,"" said Blaine Ashcraft, executive director of the Greater Ketchikan Chamber of Commerce. Ashdown saw a boondoggle. His challenge was to make an obscure Alaskan bridge interesting, to find colorful words that would break through the din of messages competing for the public's attention. He was by no means the first to use the phrase ""bridge to nowhere."" It has been used for decades to describe unpopular bridges, including spans from Pittsburgh to Pensacola. On June 12, 2003, Ashdown issued a press release announcing the Golden Fleece award was going to Rep. Don Young, the Alaska Republican who sponsored the bridge. At first, it looked like the effort was off to a great start. Within hours, the Associated Press in Alaska published a story. But the phrase did not appear. Months went by. No one used the phrase. Ashdown was discouraged. All that work and all he had to show for it was one measly AP story. 'A little oinker' In the spring of 2004, Ashdown got a call from Timothy Egan of the New York Times, who was writing a story about the Gravina bridge and another one known as Knik Arm in Anchorage. During several interviews with Egan, Ashdown said ""bridge to nowhere"" at least 40 times. Egan's story, ""Built With Steel, Perhaps, but Greased With Pork,"" ran on the front page of the Times on Saturday, April 10, 2004. It marked the media debut of the phrase Ashdown, in Paragraph 16: ""It's a gold-plated bridge to nowhere ..."" and it portrayed the bridge as part of a money-grab by Alaska's congressional delegation. Egan quoted Young, who chaired the powerful transportation committee, boasting that he wanted to be ""a little oinker."" Once again, it looked like Ashdown's phrase was about to take off. The next day, on Meet the Press, when Sen. John McCain was asked about boosting military spending without increasing the deficit, he complained about ""bridges to nowhere in Alaska."" But again it fell flat. Despite Ashdown's salesmanship, the bridge to nowhere wasn't ready for prime time. The span was merely a proposal and had not been approved by Congress. The 2004 presidential campaign was dominating the news and voters weren't especially bothered about political pork. Smoking pot? In the summer of 2005, when Congress began considering a highway bill, there was an uptick of interest in the bridge. Journalists repeated the phrase in stories that skewered the pork-laden bill. At this point, Alaska leaders might have been able to quash the controversy if they had given a cogent defense of the bridge. The state had been blessed with two lawmakers who had the clout to get millions for the bridge - Young and Sen. Ted Stevens. But they also happened to be two of the most mercurial lawmakers in the U.S. Capitol. As criticism mounted, Young, who had boasted that he stuffed the bill ""like a turkey,"" told the Associated Press that, ""These people keep saying it's nowhere, they're just smoking pot."" The opposition was gaining ground, but not quickly enough. Congress passed Young's highway bill, with the bridge tucked inside. On Aug. 10, the president signed it into law. The tale of Ashdown's phrase might have ended here. But two stories gave it new life. Duke Cunningham, a California lawmaker under investigation, had drawn attention to congressional pork because he had earmarked money for a defense contractor in return for bribes. Then along came Hurricane Katrina. As cost estimates for the hurricane soared, lawmakers on Capitol Hill began looking for expensive federal projects that could be cut or delayed. The bridge to nowhere was the perfect target. 'Kiss my ear' Suddenly, Ashdown's phrase exploded in the media. In editorials, op-ed columns and TV news shows, the bridge was cited as a case study of federal priorities that were out of whack. As McCain said on CNN, ""Do the American people want their tax dollars to go to the victims of Hurricane Katrina - and now Rita - or do they want it to go to a bridge to nowhere?"" An editorial in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch groused about the highway bill ""larded with pork barrel public works projects like bridges to Nowhere, Alaska."" A letter to the editor of the Chattanooga Times Free Press declared that ""$200-million bridges to nowhere in Alaska and other outrageous pork projects have to be eliminated."" Young sneered at his critics' suggestion that he give back the money. ""They can kiss my ear,"" he said. In the Senate, Tom Coburn, R-Okla., proposed cutting federal money from the Gravina and Knik Arm bridges and directing much of it to repair a span in Louisiana damaged by the hurricane. Coburn said it was ""time for us to change our priorities."" Stevens, in an emotional, fist-pounding speech, said Coburn was attacking not the bridges, but Alaska itself. He thundered that it was wrong for a senator to steal another senator's pork. ""I will put the Senate on notice - and I don't kid people - if the Senate decides to discriminate against our state and take money only from our state, I will resign from this body."" Stevens defeated the amendment 82-15. But he hadn't stopped the growing furor around the nation. Pop status Three weeks later, Parade magazine, circulation 34-million, cemented the pop status for the bridge with a cover story titled, ""A Visit to The Bridge to Nowhere."" That marked a turning point when the phrase reached critical mass and began to have serious political consequences. Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., was so worried that he wrote to House Speaker Dennis Hastert warning that the phrase was damaging their party. ""Ask anyone what the 'bridges to nowhere' are and they will tell you they are a serious example of a Republican Congress bringing home some of the most expensive bacon in history on the taxpayers' dime,"" Flake wrote. Across the nation, in campaign events and town hall meetings, members of Congress heard a chorus of complaints about the bridge to nowhere. It seemed everyone knew about it. On the CBS-TV drama Threshold, one of the characters spoke derisively of the government paying for ""bridges to nowhere."" In the St. Petersburg Times, a letter to the editor used the phrase to lambast government funding for a bridge on the 15th hole at the Dunedin Country Club. Ashdown's phrase spawned imitators. There was the ""wall to nowhere"" (the border fence between the United States and Mexico), the ""runway to nowhere"" (at the St. Louis airport) and the ""railway to nowhere"" (a rail line in Mississippi). But Rep. Young, oblivious to the growing PR problem, scoffed at the criticism and disputed Flake's claim that the bridge was harming their party. ""He hasn't got any traction,"" Young told the Anchorage Daily News. ""He's a dog lying on ice right now: He's scratching a lot but he doesn't go anywhere."" In Ketchikan, community leaders were frustrated. In their view, the news media distorted the story, but they couldn't agree on how to respond and opted to say little. As a result, the national debate remained lopsided. The critics kept attacking, but Stevens, Young and the Ketchikan leaders failed to mount a forceful response. Collateral damage Congressional leaders had tried to quell the controversy by removing the earmarks for Gravina and Knik Arm from a spending bill, but they did not cut Alaska's transportation money by the same amount, so the state was still free to build the bridges with federal dollars. The phrase, fueled by the Parade cover story, a segment on ABC's 20/20 and countless mentions on talk radio, kept spreading. As the 2006 campaigns got underway, Flake's prediction was coming true: The bridge had become a serious political liability. Amazingly, a bridge to a tiny Alaska island was now an issue in House and Senate races in Rhode Island, Michigan, New York and Minnesota. It came up in debates and was a dependable attack line against Republican incumbents. Brian Riedl, an analyst with the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the phrase was as evocative as the $400 hammer that symbolized Pentagon waste in the 1980s. In Rhode Island, Republican Sen. Lincoln Chafee was pummeled from the right and the left for voting with Stevens on the bridge. The conservative Club for Growth ran TV ads that blasted him for supporting ""that bridge to nowhere boondoggle up in Alaska."" Chafee ended up losing his seat. Analysts say the bridge was a factor. Nationally, the phrase also played a role in the Democrats seizing control of Congress. The Iraq war and disapproval of President Bush were the main forces, but the strong public disapproval of the Republican Congress - fueled by the phrase Ashdown conceived in a bar four years earlier - played its part. Jennifer Duffy, an analyst with the Cook Political Report, said the phrase drove home the message, ""Republicans were not being good stewards of your tax dollars.""

Three words that changed U.S. How ""bridge to nowhere"" shaped an election, and the Congress. WASHINGTON - Like so many Washington tales, this one begins in a bar. Keith Ashdown, the spokesman and chief sloganeer for a watchdog group, had been stewing about how to describe Alaska's Gravina Island Bridge in a news release. He wanted a catchy phrase that expressed the huge cost and dubious need for the milelong span. Then, as he stood beneath a Miller Lite sign at a bar called the Hawk 'n' Dove, he had a brainstorm. Four years later, the phrase has done what few political slogans can do. It shaped public opinion, influenced an election and pressured Congress to change its rules. Mentioned hundreds of times in newspapers, on TV and at countless dinner tables, it became shorthand for political pork and a Congress that was out of touch. ""It was an extraordinarily powerful image,"" said Rep. Adam Putnam, R-Bartow. ""It became a metaphor for a Republican majority that had lost its way on fiscal responsibility."" Language columnist William Safire called it ""the phrase that launched a thousand editorials."" Columnist George Will wrote after the November election: ""Republicans now know where the bridge to nowhere leads: to the political wilderness."" This is the story of three words that changed American politics. Ashdown is an unlikely Washington power broker. He has never held elected office, he's not a lawyer and he rarely wears a tie. A stocky 34-year-old with a deep voice and a belly built by beer, he looks more linebacker than lobbyist. He works for Taxpayers for Common Sense, a Washington group that opposes corruption and government waste. He plays a unique role in the Washington power structure: part detective, part press agent. He gets tips about government shenanigans, verifies them, and then passes them to reporters with snappy quotes they can't resist. He described a project that helped a lawmaker's wife as ""pillow-talk pork"" and said Pentagon officials have ""spent money like Paris Hilton at a shoe sale."" Better than most in the nation's capital, Ashdown understands that the fewest words often say the most. That's why on that night at the bar in December 2002, he was determined to find just the right ones. He had learned of the Gravina Island Bridge a year earlier from an Alaskan environmentalist. He decided the $190-million bridge would be good for the Golden Fleece, a legendary award for dubious federal spending. The bridge would link the greater Ketchikan area, which has about 13,000 residents, with an island of 50 inhabitants that is home to the town's airport. It would replace a passenger ferry, but its main purpose was to encourage development on the island. ""It was really a bridge to the future of the community,"" said Blaine Ashcraft, executive director of the Greater Ketchikan Chamber of Commerce. Ashdown saw a boondoggle. His challenge was to make an obscure Alaskan bridge interesting, to find colorful words that would break through the din of messages competing for the public's attention. He was by no means the first to use the phrase ""bridge to nowhere."" It has been used for decades to describe unpopular bridges, including spans from Pittsburgh to Pensacola. On June 12, 2003, Ashdown issued a press release announcing the Golden Fleece award was going to Rep. Don Young, the Alaska Republican who sponsored the bridge. At first, it looked like the effort was off to a great start. Within hours, the Associated Press in Alaska published a story. But the phrase did not appear. Months went by. No one used the phrase. Ashdown was discouraged. All that work and all he had to show for it was one measly AP story. In the spring of 2004, Ashdown got a call from Timothy Egan of the New York Times, who was writing a story about the Gravina bridge and another one known as Knik Arm in Anchorage. During several interviews with Egan, Ashdown said ""bridge to nowhere"" at least 40 times. Egan's story, ""Built With Steel, Perhaps, but Greased With Pork,"" ran on the front page of the Times on Saturday, April 10, 2004. It marked the media debut of the phrase Ashdown, in Paragraph 16: ""It's a gold-plated bridge to nowhere ..."" and it portrayed the bridge as part of a money-grab by Alaska's congressional delegation. Egan quoted Young, who chaired the powerful transportation committee, boasting that he wanted to be ""a little oinker."" Once again, it looked like Ashdown's phrase was about to take off. The next day, on Meet the Press, when Sen. John McCain was asked about boosting military spending without increasing the deficit, he complained about ""bridges to nowhere in Alaska."" But again it fell flat. Despite Ashdown's salesmanship, the bridge to nowhere wasn't ready for prime time. The span was merely a proposal and had not been approved by Congress. The 2004 presidential campaign was dominating the news and voters weren't especially bothered about political pork. In the summer of 2005, when Congress began considering a highway bill, there was an uptick of interest in the bridge. Journalists repeated the phrase in stories that skewered the pork-laden bill. At this point, Alaska leaders might have been able to quash the controversy if they had given a cogent defense of the bridge. The state had been blessed with two lawmakers who had the clout to get millions for the bridge - Young and Sen. Ted Stevens. But they also happened to be two of the most mercurial lawmakers in the U.S. Capitol. As criticism mounted, Young, who had boasted that he stuffed the bill ""like a turkey,"" told the Associated Press that, ""These people keep saying it's nowhere, they're just smoking pot."" The opposition was gaining ground, but not quickly enough. Congress passed Young's highway bill, with the bridge tucked inside. On Aug. 10, the president signed it into law. The tale of Ashdown's phrase might have ended here. But two stories gave it new life. Duke Cunningham, a California lawmaker under investigation, had drawn attention to congressional pork because he had earmarked money for a defense contractor in return for bribes. Then along came Hurricane Katrina. As cost estimates for the hurricane soared, lawmakers on Capitol Hill began looking for expensive federal projects that could be cut or delayed. The bridge to nowhere was the perfect target. Suddenly, Ashdown's phrase exploded in the media. In editorials, op-ed columns and TV news shows, the bridge was cited as a case study of federal priorities that were out of whack. As McCain said on CNN, ""Do the American people want their tax dollars to go to the victims of Hurricane Katrina - and now Rita - or do they want it to go to a bridge to nowhere?"" An editorial in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch groused about the highway bill ""larded with pork barrel public works projects like bridges to Nowhere, Alaska."" A letter to the editor of the Chattanooga Times Free Press declared that ""$200-million bridges to nowhere in Alaska and other outrageous pork projects have to be eliminated.""

http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2016/jul/08/brad-schimel/do-more-people-die-wisconsin-overdoses-car-crashes/	"""More people now die in Wisconsin from drug overdoses than car crashes."""	true	['Drugs']	http://host.madison.com/	http://host.madison.com/wsj/opinion/column/brad-schimel-lessons-from-prince-s-overdose-death/article_2c48d5d0-2a85-5d8d-afe5-a72a3e5ccce4.html	2016/07/08	SaveIn the weeks since the tragic passing of visionary musician Prince, many speculate his death may have been linked to drug abuse. We now know his death resulted from an overdose of the opiate medication Fentanyl.Prince’s hits were all over the radio when I was in my 20s and 30s. He was a truly gifted artist, and he will be missed by many fans. Out of his death, his fans and everyone noting his passing should take away two very important lessons.First, we as a society must work harder to reduce the stigma that surrounds substance addiction. As people speculated about the cause of Prince’s death, what judgments were they forming, perhaps even just subconsciously? Did they think he must be weak or of low moral character?Too often, society attaches labels such as those to people who are suffering from addiction. The truth is that addiction is a disease. We would not view people with leukemia or diabetes as deserving to suffer or die because they have the misfortune of being struck with a disease. What do we think, though, when we hear a news story about a person who died from a drug overdose?About 10 percent of Americans suffer from substance addiction. Addiction knows no socio-economic, gender, geographic or racial boundaries. For many people struggling with addiction and their families, it is kept secret because they fear the judgments they will face from others. As a result, they don’t seek help when they should.Prince seemed to have some quirks that go with being a celebrity, but I have never seen anything that suggests he was weak or a person of bad character. It is time to start looking at others who struggle with addiction compassionately and supportively. The odds are high that someone you care about suffers from this disease, and perhaps that person hasn’t sought help and is afraid of what you will think. It is time to change that.Second, I hope the passing of this music legend teaches us that no one is immune to the dangers that come with the abuse of prescription painkillers. They are highly addictive and can be deadly when abused. As a multi-millionaire, Prince had resources far beyond anything available to most of us. He could have afforded the best treatment available. Still, it took his life.This is probably not the first time opiates caused Prince serious health dangers. He had cancelled a concert due to a health concern prior to his fatal overdose. I don’t know whether that was opiate-related, but Fentanyl is an extraordinarily strong opiate. It is many times more powerful than heroin that can be purchased on the street.Data shows most people do not start off abusing the strongest painkiller. More likely, Prince progressed to abusing such a strong drug after his body built up a higher tolerance for less potent prescription medications. Here is a frightening fact: 80 percent of those who abuse heroin started by abusing prescription pain pills such as Oxycontin, Percoset or Vicodin. Once their tolerance builds, they seek ever higher doses or more powerful opiates. They become helplessly trapped.Opiates took Prince’s life despite his virtually unlimited resources and network of supporters. If it can happen to him, it can happen to any of us. Once addicted, the power of these drugs can be stronger than even the fear of death. And far too often, addiction comes quickly.As a society, we need to make treatment more readily available to those who are addicted. We absolutely need to lock up those who prey on our society by trafficking deadly drugs, especially to young people, but we will not incarcerate our way out of this public health crisis.Ultimately, our best chance to stem the nationwide opiate and heroin crisis is prevention.We must alter our view of opiates. More people now die in Wisconsin from drug overdoses than car crashes. Prescription opiates, not heroin, are the top killer in our state. In fact, more die from prescription painkillers than from heroin and cocaine combined.Opiates are appropriately prescribed in some circumstances, but they must only be used in exactly the way they are prescribed by a doctor.About 70 percent of the time, when a person begins abusing opiates, they do not get them from a doctor. They acquire them improperly from a family member or a friend. So we all have a role in solving this epidemic by securely storing painkillers in our homes and by properly disposing them.I was sad to learn about Prince’s death. I am even more saddened, though, about the 850 or so of my fellow citizens in our state who die from drug overdoses every year.Let’s not let any of them die in vain. Let’s do something to put an end to this tragic public health crisis. Please go to doseofrealitywi.gov to learn more about how we can make our state safer and healthier.	1.0

""Those have been on politicians since Sept. 12, 2001."" Catch David Wright's report tonight on ""World News with Charles Gibson."" The standard political reply to that question might well have been, ""My patriotism speaks for itself."" But Obama didn't say that. nullPlaynullInstead the Illinois senator answered the question at length, explaining that he no longer wears such a pin, at least in part, because of the Iraq War. ""You know, the truth is that right after 9/11, I had a pin,"" Obama said. ""Shortly after 9/11, particularly because as we're talking about the Iraq War, that became a substitute for I think true patriotism, which is speaking out on issues that are of importance to our national security, I decided I won't wear that pin on my chest. ""Instead,"" he said, ""I'm going to try to tell the American people what I believe will make this country great, and hopefully that will be a testimony to my patriotism."" In Iowa, some Obama supporters applauded the candidate's fashion statement. Said Carrie Haurum of Waterloo: ""He doesn't need to wear that flag on his lapel. He wears it in his heart."" But talk radio and cable news quickly pounced on the issue. ""It just shows you he's not ready for the big time,"" conservative Laura Ingrams opined on Fox News. Said Sean Hannity: ""Why do we wear pins? Because our country is under attack!"" The Obama campaign declined to expand on the senator's statement. Spokesman Bill Burton said, ""His comments speak for themselves."" But, Obama responded to the mini controversy. ""I'm less concerned with what you're wearing on your lapel than what's in your heart,"" Obama said Thursday while campaigning in Independence, Iowa. ""You show your patriotism by how you treat your fellow Americans, especially those who serve. And you show your patriotism by being true to your values and ideals. And that's what we have to lead with, our values and ideals,"" Obama said. Of course, if he had said that in the first place, he might have avoided any controversy. Obama is not alone in not wearing the Stars and Stripes pin. Most of the candidates do not wear them. The one big exception: former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is rarely without one. Democrat John Edwards almost always wears his late son's Outward Bound pin. Hillary Clinton tends not to wear the flag pin, although ABC News off-air reporter Eloise Harper has found several images where she does. ""Well I think there are so many ways that Americans can show their patriotism,"" she said. ""Wearing a flag pin, flying the flag, pledging allegiance to the flag, talking about the values that are important to America, teaching your children about what a great nation we have, standing up for those values, speaking out, there is just so many ways that one can demonstrate patriotism.""

This is a political stunt.WALLACE: We'll talk with the chair of the committee, Congressman Trey Gowdy, and the head of the House Democratic Caucus, Xavier Becerra. It's a ""Fox News Sunday"" exclusive.And with Republicans investigating Benghazi and citing IRS official Lois Lerner for contempt, Democrats dismiss it as conspiracy week. Our Sunday panel discusses which side has the better argument.Plus, our Power Player of the Week. Geno Auriemma has led UConn's women's basketball team to nine national championships. Now, he's talking to Pentagon officials about leadership.GENO AURIEMMA, UCONN COACH: We're doing the same thing they're doing, except the stakes for us are just winning and losing a game.All, right now, on ""Fox News Sunday.""(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: And hello again from Fox News in Washington.As we celebrate Mother's Day, it remains a time of heartbreak for hundreds of mothers in Nigeria, whose daughters have been kidnapped by Islamist militants. First lady Michelle Obama spoke out in this week's presidential address.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MICHELLE OBAMA, FIRST LADY: In these girls, about a rack and I see our own daughters. We see their hopes and their dreams. And we can only imagine the anguish their parents are feeling right now.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: More than 250 girls are still missing.Let's get the latest now from Fox News national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin -- Jennifer.JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Chris, six unarmed U.S. military personnel are now on the ground in Nigeria, part of a group of 16 U.S. personnel. They've been sent to try to pinpoint where the kidnapped schoolgirls are being held by the Islamic fighters known as Boko Haram. There are rising demands that the U.S. and others do more to help the mothers and families of these young girls.And now, the Pentagon is discussing the possibility of moving surveillance and reconnaissance assets towards Nigeria, possibly drones. A senior U.S. official tells me they are waiting for Nigeria to formally make the request. However, there is still no talk of sending armed U.S. troops to assist the search.Outrage ensued three weeks after the kidnapping when this video appeared this week from the leader of Boko Haram laughing as he boasted about converting the Christian girls in the group to Islam, threatening to sell the girls into slavery. The U.S. placed a $7 million bounty on him last year, and in November, designated Boko Haram a foreign terror organization after the State Department resisted request to do so for several years.The group's name means ""Western education is a sin."" The first lady tweeted this picture demanding the girls' return.The Nigerian president who did not speak publicly about the kidnapped girls or call for a security meeting to mount a search for more than two weeks finally spoke.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOODLUCK JONATHAN, NIGERIAN PRESIDENT: (INAUDIBLE)(END VIDEO CLIP)GRIFFIN: Perhaps the most explosive revelation since the kidnapping on April 15th is that the Nigerian military was warned four hours before it occurred and did not use its security forces to try to stop it -- Chris.WALLACE: Jennifer, thank you.For more, we're joined by the CEO and co-founder of a Malala Fund, Shiza Shahid, who's in New York. And here in studio, former U.S. ambassador to Nigeria, John Campbell.President Obama talked about the limits of what he can do to try to rescue these schoolgirls. Let's watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: I have this remarkable title right now, president of the United States. And, yet, there are times in which I want to reach out and save those kids and -- having to think through what levers, what power do we have at any given moment.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Ambassador Campbell, realistically, what can the U.S. and also what can the government of Nigeria do to try to save those hundreds of schoolgirls?JOHN CAMPBELL, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO NIGERIA: The U.S. can provide technical assistance, particularly intelligence, intelligence sharing. It can also provide expertise in things like negotiation strategies if and when that becomes something which is feasible.However, for the U.S. to do anything requires the request and acquiescence of the Nigerian government. Nigeria is a sovereign country. And we can operate in Nigeria only at the behest of the government.WALLACE: And why -- because this came up in Jennifer's report, why has Nigeria been so reluctant to take action for itself and to ask for international help?CAMPBELL: Nigeria traditionally views itself as the giant of Africa as indeed it is in terms of population. It is a proud country that for a long time has played an extraordinarily positive role in conflict resolution in West Africa.In other words, the Nigerian -- Nigerians look to help, not be helped. So, this is a different set of circumstances for Nigeria.WALLACE: Let me bring up one more question. What does this terrorist group Boko Haram want? Is this all about a prisoner swap for some of their members who are in Nigerian jails or is this simply about terrorizing the Nigerian people and undercutting the central government?CAMPBELL: What Boko Haram's rhetoric says is it wants to destroy the Nigerian state. It wants to destroy the Nigerian state because the state is secular. It wants to destroy Western education because it sees Western education as promoting secularism and shaping the Nigerian state.WALLACE: Ms. Shahid, you run the Malala Fund named after your good friend Malala Yousufzai, who was subject to a terrible attack in Pakistan -- a schoolgirl who was speaking for girls' rights.Why are these terrorists -- these Islamist groups so frustrated, so threatened by the power of women?SHIZA SHAHID, CEO & CO-FOUNDER, MALALA FUND: Chris, it's unfortunately a tactic that we've seen deployed by extreme groups again and again as means of intimidation, of control, of terrorizing families, of terrorizing entire populations. And it really stems from the wider ideology of groups like Boko Haram and the Taliban which attacked Malala, of course. That is fear of progress, fear of liberal and progressive thinking, and fear of women in particular being empowered.In the Swat Valley, we saw this as a gradual progression where first children were asked to be segregated, then they demanded some changes in the curriculum and then moved towards actual destruction of schools. And in Nigeria, it's been an even swifter and more horrifying attack with the kidnapping of almost 300 schoolgirls.WALLACE: Let me ask you about the actions of the Malala Fund, because you're now donating all the money you (INAUDIBLE) to Nigerian women's groups and you are calling for urgent action to try to save these girls. Would you like to see President Obama and the U.S. use all military assets to launch a rescue mission?SHAHID: Well, I think it's promising that the Nigerian president has accepted the offers of support from the U.S. and from the United Kingdom and that these teams are now on the ground. It's unfortunate that it took three weeks for this cooperation to come about. And given that it is Mother's Day, we are hopeful that things will move quickly from here on.It's also been incredibly promising to see the power of social media in this case, almost 900,000 signatures on the petition Change.org calling for the release of these girls, and 2 million impressions on Twitter with the hashtag, #bringbackourgirls. It really compelled the Nigerian government and international community to move on this issue.We have to stay hopeful and, you know, the Malala Fund is pushing and a variety of groups are pushing to see these girls return safely and to see longer term investments in the security and education of Nigeria.WALLACE: Former Secretary of State Clinton spoke out this week about the kidnappings. Here she is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON: The government of Nigeria needs to get serious about protecting all of its citizens, girls and women, as well as boys and men, and ensuring that every child has the right and opportunity to go to school in security and safety.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: But, Ambassador Campbell, Secretary Clinton has come under fire this week because of the fact that back in 2011 she rejected calls by the FBI and intelligence community to designate Boko Haram as a foreign terrorist organization. As a Bush appointee to the ambassador, do you think that's fair the criticism of Secretary Clinton?CAMPBELL: No, I don't think it's fair. And along with good many other Nigerian experts at the time, we all opposed designation.We opposed designation because we don't think that the legislation actually fits the situation in Nigeria. The Boko Haram movement is highly diffuse. It's not a centralized organization. It has important grassroots, elements to it.The legislation has to do essentially with issues like getting visas to come to the U.S. or movement of money from the U.S. to Nigeria, neither of which is relevant. What the legislation also does, however, is it inhibits the possibility of future contact between either private citizens or public personalities with Boko Haram, and at some future points, that may reduce the options that we have in terms of negotiation.WALLACE: Ms. Shahid, you know, that's, of course the problem here. This is obviously a horrific event. How do you reconcile your call for justice and fighting and dealing with groups like Boko Haram or the Taliban in Pakistan with all of these complications and diplomatic considerations?SHAHID: Well, I think there's things that we know have to be done -- in particular, bolstering local organizations and civil society inside Nigeria. We've known for a long time that Nigeria's local education situation is appalling. One out of every six children are out of school and are inside Nigeria and the state of protection for girls and women remains incredibly shocking.So, whether we move on certain diplomatic fronts is important but in addition what is important is that all ordinary people or aid institutions invest in building Nigeria as a country, as an economy and in the next generation through schools and through education.WALLACE: Ambassador Campbell, we have a minute left. First of all, do you think the 200, 250 girls are all in one group? Do you think they've been split up? What are the realistic chance that's we'll ever be able to save them?CAMPBELL: We, of course, have no hard information on that. But I think it's highly likely that they have been split up. And given the fact that national borders in that part of Africa are essentially lines on a piece paper drown by the British and French, I think we have to anticipate that some are in Cameroon, some are in probably Niger, perhaps some as far as Chad, as well as some in Nigeria.WALLACE: Do you think we'll ever get them back?CAMPBELL: I think the question is how many do we get back? We're talking about a very large number of people. The Nigerian media reports that two of the girls already have been killed by snake bite.WALLACE: So, it's a bleak situation?CAMPBELL: It's a bleak situation.WALLACE: Ms. Shahid, Ambassador Campbell, we want to thank you both so much for coming in today. We will stay on top of this story.CAMPBELL: Thank you.SHAHID: Thank you.WALLACE: Do you think the U.S. should do more to try to rescue the Nigerian schoolgirls? Join the conversation on Facebook with other FNS viewers.Up next, House Republicans set up a select committee to investigate Benghazi. The Democrats are divided about whether to participate. We'll talk with the chair of the new panel as well as the head of the House Democratic Caucus.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: House Speaker John Boehner has named seven Republicans to a select committee to investigate the Benghazi terror attack. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi calls it a political stunt and is still considering whether her party will participate.The new chair of the select committee, congressman and former prosecutor, Trey Gowdy, joins us from South Carolina. And here in Washington, Congressman Xavier Becerra, head of the House Democratic Caucus.Congressman Gowdy, you have been talking this week about how you're going to run this committee, and one comment has raised some eyebrows. Here it is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOWDY: If the administration is slow-walking document production, I can't end the trial simply because the defense won't cooperate.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Congressman, do you see this investigation as a trial? And do you see the White House as the defense?GOWDY: No, sir, and I would hasten that -- first of all, happy Mother's Day you to and Mr. Becerra.I would also hasten to add that trials are both criminal and civil for 16 years I spoke in trial metaphors and perhaps I need to get out of that habit. What I simply meant is, when you ask me how long something's going to last, I need to know how cooperative the other side is going to be. So, to the extent that I said any indication to anyone that I view someone as the defense, what I meant by that is if you can tell me how cooperative the other side is going to be, I can give you a better idea of how long something's going to last.WALLACE: Congressman Becerra, you have been talking about the committee as a kangaroo court, your words. First of all, how do you know that before it even begins meeting? And do you really believe that all the questions about Benghazi have been answered?HOUSE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS CHAIRMAN XAVIER BECERRA, D-CALIF.: Well, what leads us to believe it could be a kangaroo court or a smokescreen from having to deal with the real issues Americans want to deal with like job creation and so forth, is that we've done these investigations some seven times, five of the investigations coming out of five of the House Republican committees.And so, we've done this over 18 months. We've spent millions of dollars. And we see what happens when you have a short trial.WALLACE: Let me ask you a question, do you believe that all the questions about the Benghazi have been answered?BECERRA: I have not heard any new questions raised that have not been answered.WALLACE: Let me ask you a question and maybe you can answer it for me. Where was the president? And what did he do the night of the attack?BECERRA: I believe the president was at the White House and he was in communication with some of the folks with his administration in and around time of the attacks.WALLACE: Do you -- do you know, Congressman Gowdy, where the president was and what he was doing during the seven hours of the attack?GOWDY: No, sir, I do not. Nor do I know what communication if any he had with Secretary of State Clinton, nor can I tell you why we were still in Benghazi despite the fact that there was an escalation in violence in the months leading up, nor do I know whether or not the president called any of our allies in the region and said, can you get any assets to Benghazi? We're under attack.I have more questions than answers despite the fact that committees of Congress have looked at this attack for 19 months now.WALLACE: Congressman Becerra, can you answer the specific questions that you just heard from Congressman Gowdy?BECERRA: Sure. And by the way, I also want to say happy Mother's Day to all the mothers out there. But, Trey, you served on one of the committees that did this investigation. You're a great prosecutor. You should have asked those questions or you could have asked those questions. I bet you did ask those questions.And so, the issue, Chris, is, are we going over and over and over? And now are we setting up a process that's not only going to be a fair, balanced or open approach to this, but also is appearing to be a smokescreen so they can raise campaign funds, because right now, we know the Republicans are raising campaign funds off of this Benghazi investigation that they're calling for. And so, it's very distressing --WALLACE: We're going to get to the campaign funds in a moment. But what about this argument, Congressman Gowdy, you had the opportunity to ask those questions before?GOWDY: Well, first of all, thank you, Mr. Becerra, for overstating my career as a prosecutor.Secondly, I don't have access to intel. I don't have access to sources and methods. I don't have access -- I have never interviewed Susan Rice about anything. I have never an opportunity to ask the secretary of state questions about the lead-up to Benghazi and why we were still there.One of the problems with the existing committee structure is they are stovepipe -- they are fragmented. We can't cross jurisdictional boundaries, which is why I asked for a select committee over a year ago, so that we can tear the barriers down and we can have access to all the information, and we're not stovepipe or fragmented according to which committee we're on.WALLACE: All right. I have another question and maybe the biggest question at this point is whether or not Democrats participate in this process?Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was making some demands this week. Let's put them up on the screen.Democrats must sign off on subpoenas. They must be allowed to participate and witness interviews and Republicans must not selectively release testimony.Congressman Becerra, I have a simple question, you are saying if you get satisfactory answers to those, that Democrats will participate? And if you don't, that you won't?BECERRA: We've participated in all the other seven investigations. If it's a fair, open and balanced process, absolutely. But we don't want to see reckless, irresponsible handling of an affair that took the lives of four brave Americans.WALLACE: So, I just want to -- you're saying that if you are satisfied with the ground rules, you're declaring that the Democrats will appoint members to this committee? BECERRA: I believe so. We've always said that we're ready to participate. We have an oversight responsibility in Congress. What we don't want to see is reckless and irresponsible use of Congress and taxpayer money to do these witch hunts.WALLACE: Congressman Gowdy, is it unreasonable for Democrats to demand some say in how the committee is run?GOWDY: No, sir. And if you talk to the ranking members of the two subcommittees that I have presided, Zoe Lofgren and Eleanor Holmes Norton, they will tell you I don't run my committees the way that Democrats are fearful of.I want a process, Chris, that at the end of it, you are welcomed to draw different conclusions from the facts. But I want everyone to say, it was fair. It was exhaustive and we know more than we did when it started.So, on two of those three points, I think reasonable minds can agree. On the first point though, Chris, imagine you and I starting an investigation and the first thing you ask for is the ability to deny or veto subpoenas going to witnesses. How can it be a pursuit of the truth?BECERRA: We've never asked for that, Trey. What we're simply saying is, make it a process where we can't be excluded from the interview of witnesses, where we can't be excluded when a decision is made to subpoena a witness. Make it so that we're all in the room when we're reviewing the documents that are supposed to be evidence.What we don't want to be is excluded. We don't want the American public to be shutout. Fair, balanced and open --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Go ahead, Congressman.GOWDY: How does it benefit me, Xavier, when I said from day one, I want this to transcend politics and I want it to inspire trust in you and our citizens? How does it benefit me to do any of the things you just listed? I haven't done it in the first three years that I'm in Congress.WALLACE: I'm going to declare a victory here and say that the Democrats are going to participate. This week --BECERRA: Based on a fair, balanced and open process.WALLACE: I love the fact that you're adopting the Fox News slogan.BECERRA: We call it the Fox standard, OK?WALLACE: The Fox standard? You could do worse.This week, Hillary Clinton said Benghazi has been thoroughly investigated, but then she added this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: Some choose not to be satisfied and choose to continue to move forward. That's their choice. And I do not believe there is any reason for it to continue in this way but they get to call the shots in the Congress.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Congressman Gowdy, what specifically do you want to learn from Secretary Clinton and how do you answer charges that one of the major goals of this committee is to hurt Hillary Clinton's chances for 2016?GOWDY: Chris, I have no friends to reward and no foes to punish. We're going to go wherever the facts take us.Facts are neither Republican nor Democrat. They are facts. And if we overplay our hand or if we engage in a process that is not fair, according to the American people, we will be punished as we should be for that.(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: So tell me the single biggest question you want to ask Secretary Clinton?GOWDY: Why were we still in Benghazi? The British ambassador was almost assassinated. Our facility was attacked twice. There were multiple episodes of violence. We were the last flag flying in Benghazi and I would like to know why.WALLACE: The Pew Research Center did a poll recently, I want to put results up on the screen because when asked, what single thing they have the most negative view of in Hillary Clinton's career people said Benghazi, even more than the Monica Lewinsky scandal.Congressman Becerra, people still have a lot of questions about Hillary Clinton's role.BECERRA: Chris, so the year and a half that was spent by seven different committees didn't answer that? Of course it did.WALLACE: Wait. Wait. You keep pointing to that.We didn't find out -- and they have subpoenaed all the State Department documents -- excuse me, sir -- they had subpoenaed all the State Department documents, and it took until last week for the administration finally to release the Ben Rhodes e-mail in which two days before Susan Rice appeared on this show, he was suggesting that she'd say that it was because of the video, not because of a policy failure.BECERRA: You got juiced (ph). You know that that email shows nothing new. It simply -- WALLACE: I don't agree with that. I think it shows something dramatically new. It shows that despite what the White House -- it shows despite what the White House has been saying for the last year and a half, it shows that inside the White House, they were telling Susan Rice what to say.BECERRA: Chris, every time you get a witness or someone that comes to talk you to here, they're always going to try to prepare for that conversation with you.WALLACE: That's not what Jay Carney had said for 20 months.BECERRA: That e-mail had nothing that is inconsistent with what the CIA and our security personnel were telling us at the time. It's exactly the same.But if I can make one quick point -- I love what Trey just said. I hope Trey is going to stay true to what he just said. The rules, however, will determine if this is a fair process, not what Trey says. It's whether the rules or the conduct of the hearing will provide for a fair, open and balanced process.WALLACE: All right. You brought up an earlier point, I want to finish with that with Congressman Gowdy.You say this is not political, that this is just about fact- finding. But as Congressman Becerra brought up, just this week, the National Republican Congressional Committee, which is the committee that supports GOP House candidates sent thought fund-raiser. ""House Republicans will make sure that no one will get away from Gowdy and the select committee and then will you automatically add your name today to join us and become a Benghazi watchdog?""This is a fund-raiser coming out from the NRCC. Congressman Gowdy, isn't this exactly the problem, the danger, the risk that you overstep your bounds? The GOP, not you personally, you overreach and you make this political and as Congressman Becerra mentioned, you end up like going on a political hunt instead of dealing with issues that people deal with their daily lives like ObamaCare and jobs?GOWDY: Yes, which is exactly why I said I will never and have never sent out any fund-raising literature trying to raise money in the grief and tragedy of four dead Americans. I have asked my colleagues to follow suit.But my friends and colleague Tommy Cotton from Arkansas did a magnificent job on the House floor of pointing out the duplicity and hypocrisy of Democrats all of a sudden concluding that certain things are above politics. They raise money on Sandy Hook. They raise money on Katrina. They raise money on Iraq and Afghanistan.So, for me, I will not raise money on Benghazi just like I never raised money using crime victims when I was a prosecutor and I've asked my colleagues to follow suit. But it would be helpful, it would be helpful if our colleagues on other side of the aisle did not have selective amnesia when it comes to what's appropriate to raise money off of and what is not.WALLACE: All right. We're going to have to leave it there.Congressman Gowdy, Congressman Becerra, thank you both so much. Thanks for joining us today.BECERRA: Thank you.GOWDY: Thank you.WALLACE: From Benghazi to the IRS, Republicans are pursuing administration scandals. But democrats dismiss it as conspiracy week. Our Sunday group weighs in.Plus, what would you like to as the panel about accusations of politics on both sides of the Benghazi investigation? Just go to Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your question on the air.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER, R-OHIO: They've not told the truth about Benghazi. They've not told the truth about the IRS. They've not told the truth about ""Fast and Furious."" Now only one would have to guess if they're not willing to tell the American people the truth, it must not be very pretty.PELOSI: I think it's pretty clear, their focus on the Affordable Care Act has run its course. It's run its course. Now they have to find something else to talk about.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: House Speaker John Boehner and Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi debating this week whether alleged administration scandals are real or phony. And it's time now for our Sunday group. Brit Hume, Fox News senior political analyst, Julie Pace who covers the White House for the Associated Press, syndicated columnist George Will, author of the new book ""A Nice Little Place on the North Side"" about Wrigley Field at 100. And Fox News political analyst Juan Williams. Well, we asked you for questions for the panel. And we got two on Facebook that we want to put up. First of all, Tom Johnson asks, ""How can Republicans conduct these investigations so they are not written off as more Washington antics? And Donna Marie Sikes writes, ""I want to know what the Democrats are afraid of finding out."" Brit, they were writing about Benghazi. But how would you answer both of them when it comes to both Benghazi and also the pursuit of the IRS investigation?BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: I think that the answer to the first question is that it is a tall order to try to keep this inquiry from being written off as just political antics. Trey Gowdy displays the right spirit and the right attitude. He is articulate. I think he'll be a more effective chairman than those who have conducted these prior inquiries have been. But there is some things that he doesn't have that normally are present in these situations. There is no tail wind afforded by a red hot media climate on this issue. There has been a little bit more media -- mainstream media buy in on this story lately, but not very much. And that has always been present in the past and when these investigations have worked because it required the politicians in both parties to participate and not simply obstruct. My guess is that Democrats in this case will feel utterly free, as you can - and you could pick this up from Nancy Pelosi's comments, to kind of dismiss this and really not contribute. And that will add to the sense that this is a political circus. So, I think it's a tall order.WALLACE: Julie, you covered the White House. And I'm curious, how do top officials there regard what the Democrats are calling conspiracy week, the appointment of the select committee, the voting by the House of Lois Lerner, the IRS official in contempt. Do they see these as serious threats or do they think that Republicans have been distracted from better issues, more effective issues for them like ObamaCare?JULIE PACE, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS: Well, I don't think that they write them off completely, especially in the midterm election year. Any time you have something that in the atmosphere, that is not about jobs or any of the other issues that they want to be talking about, it's going to be a distraction for them. But they certainly think that Republicans have a lot of risk involved with focusing on both of these issues. You know, when you look at polling of the top issues that Americans are focused on in the midterm elections, neither the IRS or Benghazi tends to rate as a top issue. So, they think that Republicans have a risk of overreaching. But to get to one of the questions that was posed on Facebook about what are Democrats worried about coming out of this that is something that Democrats are talking about. If there is nothing to hide, maybe we should at least have a seat at the table in this Benghazi committee just to make sure that we're represented and to show that we feel like we have nothing to hide.WALLACE: George, is Nancy Pelosi right? Has ObamaCare run its course and Republicans are looking for something else to talk about?GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: No. ObamaCare has served its political function for Republicans, in mobilizing the base for what will be a mobilization election. Furthermore, late summer, probably, we'll begin to get the rate increases that will come from the various state insurance directors and it will have new lease on life. So, I don't think this has anything to do with that. This has to do with the fact that Republicans think something was terribly wrong at and around that compound that night. My hope is that they pull the focus back and ask what were we doing in Libya in the first place and what was in my judgment an unconstitutional, not to mention, illegal intervention, and furthermore, the American people could usefully be instructed as to whether or not General Lovell was right when he testified ...WALLACE: He's the deputy head of intelligence for AFRICOM, U.S. Forces in Africa.WILL: He strongly indicated that in his judgment more could have been done militarily while the attack was under way at the compound. Americans, perhaps, need to answer that and the military needs to weigh in on what it can do with its F-16s and the compound under attack in an urban neighborhood.WALLACE: Juan, Democrats say, and I want to -- this is a point that George was making, that this is just Republicans trying to gin up their face. But even if that is true in a midterm election, which is really about turnout, as many more - many fewer people vote if a midterm than in a presidential election, isn't that still an effective strategy?JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Yeah, I mean and it's an important strategy right now for Republicans. This week a lot of the Tea Party really was evidence in decline. Tom Tillis, one in the North Carolina, Republican primary, who was the non-Tea Party candidate, that's being reflected now across the country. I think you see the Tea Party in decline. There was a poll this week show Tea Party support nationally down, and principally down among Republicans. But the Tea Party is the energizing base of the Republican vote. And in order to get that vote, you have got to go to the talk show audiences. You have got to give them some red meat. And the red meat in this case is another -- this will be the 14th Benghazi investigation. Not to disagree with George about the importance of finding out why we were in Libya, what was going on at the compound that night, but none of that is the genesis of this probe. The genesis is, oh, there was an email we hadn't seen that said the White House -- one White House official wanted to project the videos more aggressively and Secretary Rice with talking points. That's all politics. Yeah, you want to make the president look good. And, yes, in fact, there were protests in Egypt, Tunisia and elsewhere caused by the video. So this has been -- it's a total farce this thing. It's a political farce. And intended to stir the Republican base and turnout for this election.WALLACE: All right. I know that there are several people on this panel are champing at the bit to get to follow that. But I want to turn back to the kidnapping, the terrible kidnapping of these Nigerian schoolgirls in the little bit of time we have left in this segment. Because this week Michelle Obama and Malala Yousafzai joined the Bring Back Our Girls movement. More than 2 million people have now tweeted the hash tag. And George, I'm just curious. Because I'm not saying I was that familiar with this phenomenon. It's even got a name, #activism. And I'm curious what you make of it. Do you think that this is significant and helpful? And can make progress? Or do you think it's really about helping the people who tweet the hash tag feel better about themselves?WILL: Exactly that. It's an exercise in self-esteem. I do not know how adults stand there facing a camera and say, bring back our girls. Are these barbarians in the wild of Nigeria are supposed to check their Twitter accounts and say, oh, Michelle Obama is very crossed with us, we better change our behavior.WALLACE: It's trending on Twitter.WILL: Power is the ability to achieve intended effects. And this is not intended to have any effect on the real world. It's a little bit like environmentalism has become. But the incandescent light bulb becomes the enemy. It has no effect whatever on the planet, but it makes people feel good about themselves.WALLACE: Julie?PACE: I do think that you have to take this for what it is. I don't think anyone is saying that by standing there and taking a picture of yourself holding a sign that you're going to get these girls back. But you have to remember, this is something that had really not been talked about, not even by the Nigerian government itself before this started to really take hold on social media. Now, what it has done is put more pressure on the Nigerian government to accept some international assistance and to raise questions about, you know, why they hadn't done that previously. So, standing there holding a sign does not bring the girls back but it could ratchet up the pressure that could lead to some more international assistance.WALLACE: All right. We have to take a break here, but when we come back, Pro-Russian separatists hold a referendum today on independence for eastern Ukraine. We'll have a live report and hear again from our panel.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: Heading to the polls in eastern Ukraine as pro-Russian separatists hold a referendum on independence for the region. Let's get the latest now from Fox News senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot live in Donetsk. Greg?GREG PALKOT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Chris, our audience (ph) continue in this controversial referendum here in eastern Ukraine. Local officials tell us that the turnout is colossal. Kiev and the State Department is branding the vote illegal. Here's a little bit of what we saw.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PALKOT: The ballots for this referendum vote on self-rule in the region are marked in private over there and then brought over to these transparent ballot boxes where we can get an early unofficial exit poll. The ""Da""s or yes, have it.In fact, there are a lot of irregular aspects to this poll based on old electoral rolls, if you are not on the list, you can vote anyway. Besides, there are no international observers around. Plus, the wording on the ballot is vague - yes -- could mean anything from greater autonomy to breaking away from Kiev to joining up with Russia. Those not agreeing seem to be staying away. Those showing up were pretty vocal with us. All that's done, of course, in an atmosphere of violence, security at the poll stations was visible and it was pretty heavy handed nearby. Government buildings were occupied by those pro- Russian militants. Well, the day went mostly peacefully, there were clashes reported between Ukrainian military and rebels and there were some threats at polling stations. We should expect the first results from this vote later tonight and then we'll look for reaction, especially from Russia. Vladimir Putin has been keeping a pretty careful distance from this vote in the last couple of days. Chris?WALLACE: Greg Palkot reporting from eastern Ukraine. Greg, thanks for that. And we're back now with the panel. Well, I think it's fair to say that Russian President Putin has been playing a very complicated game this week. He said he wanted to delay today's vote, but the separatists went ahead with it. He said he was pulling Russian forces back from the border of Ukraine. But then there is no sign from NATO that he did. And what you're watching now is he made a surprise visit to Crimea to celebrate the annexation of that region of Ukraine by Russia. Brit, what is Putin's strategy in all of this?HUME: His strategy is to pull into Russia's orbit as much of Ukraine as he can and as much as he wants. And so far nothing that the United States and its allies have done seems to have deterred him even in the slightest bit. He's holding all the high cards at the moment. He can take his time. He can react to the outcome of this referendum however he pleases. He can be patient. He can pause. And then he can move. But I think the direction is clear and I don't think that the disagreements among allies about what to do about it are anything, but an advantage for him. And he's - the moment he's in the cat bird seat and it falls to President Obama to try to pull some kind of coalition together to put something together that would deter him. It hasn't happened yet.WALLACE: Well, President Obama is now threatening sanctions against the entire sectors of the Russian economy, not only if Russia invades, but also if they disrupt the May 25th - separate- May 25th elections for president in that country. Julie, at the White House, do they see Putin, you know, talking about pulling troops back, saying, let's put off today's vote? Do they see him blinking at all or do they think this was just a pretext? And is there any possibility that they'll impose sanctions before the 25th?PACE: The sector sanctions or on more individuals?WALLACE: You tell us.PACE: I think sector sanctions, you're very unlikely to see those before the May 25TH election. It's very possible that you could see more sanctions on individuals or companies if there were to be some other type of provocative action before the 25TH election. In terms of Putin's thinking, I think at the White House, they don't think that he necessarily has a firm strategy. That he is actually making decisions almost day to day, week to week as this unfolds. In Europe, you see some officials who actually feel relatively -- they are interested in what Putin said last week. They think that saying that he was pulling the troops back even though we have no evidence of that and saying that these referendum today should be delayed with positive sign, the White House doesn't necessarily view it as that. So there may be a further split between the U.S. and Europe, at least in terms of the signals they're getting from Putin. WALLACE: You know, you talk about the fact that there is maybe no strategy. But before Putin went to Crimea on Friday, there was a massive display. And take a look at this, of Russia's military might in Moscow's Red Square to celebrate the victory over Nazi Germany. It keeps getting bigger. That demonstration under Putin. George, is there a strategy here? And is it - that Putin wants to rebuild greater Russia?WILL: Sure, he has a strategy and he's adjusting his tactics as he goes along as you do in any other war. And this is a war. This week president of France and chancellor of Germany demanded that he pulled back the Russian troops. Putin amiably answered, oh, I've already done that. Now our intelligence indicates he's done no such thing. But that's an indication of the fact that he is gaining not just people and territory and trying to sow discord and chaos in a substantial portion of the Ukraine so that he can then say after two weeks from today the presidential election didn't count because there is so much disorder. But beyond that, he is learning information, what he's learning is that Europe remains a geographic expression, not a political expression. And that he really has nothing to fear from the European Union.WALLACE: So, Juan, what if anything can Putin - rather President Obama and the Europeans do and whatever they do, will it be enough to stop Putin or at least get him to change his behavior?WILLIAMS: Well, I think it comes down to a military scenario. And what we've seen in the months now that this thing has been playing out is that the needle has not moved with regard to the willingness of the Americans or the Europeans to become militarily involved in that situation. So what we're down to is sanctions. And, yes, I think you can anticipate, I think Angela Merkel of Germany, Hollande of France, (INAUDIBLE) in Germany, they said yes, they are willing now to go forward with more sanctions even if they cut into the European economy. I think that was good news. But the larger issue is about the military and about weaponry. Should the U.S., for example, according to senator McCain, Senator Graham be sending weapons in to help the Ukrainians? And the European response to that is we're trying to get weapons out of there and we don't want to get into a fight with the Russians where, you know, American or European weapons are going in. They cut off supplies and then that triggers a military confrontation. At the moment, we're really talking about if the Russians go beyond the Ukrainians and attack any of the NATO allies. That is a commitment that the Europeans and U.S. would have for military action.WALLACE: Brit, I want to talk about the sanctions issue. Because critics - and I think an increasing number of them are saying instead of using sanctions as punishment for actions that Putin already takes, should you get out ahead of them and use sanctions as a deterrent to try to stop him from taking action. We always say well, if you do this, we'll respond. How about the idea of going ahead and imposing sanctions to try to prevent him from ...HUME: The way we've been operating so far hasn't worked very well, has it? So once you accept that, then the question is well, how else to do it and the way to do it would be to do the sanctions as a deterrent. What I'm -- what I sense is that they just don't want to provoke the bear, the Russian bear and because the European dependence, economic dependence on its trade with Russia is such that the Europeans are really not willing and they couldn't sell it to their publics and all that. This is where somebody needs to step up and lead. And President Obama, I don't think has done that. But the way to go would be to -- I think Russia is responsive to sanctions.WALLACE: Julie, we've got - let me - we've got 30 seconds left. Any chance that the Obama administration may change and become more proactive?PACE: There certainly are some people in the White House who have some views on this that they think that we should do this ahead of time, punish Putin before he acts. So far the president has not taken that advice, though.WALLACE: And what do you think is the reason that he -- and what is the calculation?PACE: Well, again, he wants to move in coordination with the Europeans. So, he feels like if he moves on his own it doesn't have as much of an impact anyway.WALLACE: All right, thank you, panel. See you next week. Up next, our ""Power Player of the Week."" The Pentagon calls on a legendary college coach to talk teamwork.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: For 29 years, he's been the gold standard in women's college basketball. But the other day the coach of the University of Connecticut Huskies took his message to an unusual forum. Here is our Power Player of the Week.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)GENO AURIEMMA, UCONN WOMEN'S BASKETBALL HEAD COACH: We recruit our players out of high school. They're 18-year-olds. A lot of the young men and women who are in the military are of that age when they first start out.WALLACE: Geno Auriemma was at the Pentagon this week along with other college coaches for a strategy seminar, the idea to share techniques with military officers for how to assemble a winning team.AURIEMMA: General Dempsey loves to say that we never had a home game. And he's right. He said the military, the U.S. military's goal is to make sure we never play a home game.When I first started coaching, I thought that I could control all of the actions of all the players to get the desired result. And I realize now the only thing you can control is how well you train your players to handle that moment.One of the things I've seen recently, it was attributed to a Navy SEAL. And the comment was under pressure, you don't rise to the occasion. You sink to the level of your training.WALLACE: Auriemma says one key is instead of practicing set plays all the time, his team practices how to play.AURIEMMA: I'm going to give them just enough information and then say figure it out. Because once you learn to figure things out, then no matter what happens down the road, you'll figure it out.WALLACE (on camera): Obviously, there are differences as well as similarities, do you think these ideas can be helpful to the military?AURIEMMA: What they can learn from us is we're doing the same thing they're doing except the stakes for us is just winning and losing a game. We really appreciate that they're trying to do the same thing. But it's life and death on their end, not just winning a game.WALLACE (voice over): Auriemma is the most successful coach in the history of women's college basketball, which generates its own burdens.(on camera): Nine national titles, five perfect seasons. How do you create that kind of extraordinary winning culture?AURIEMMA: We tell kids, look, you go to another school. It's OK to lose. Here, if you go to Connecticut and you lose one game, right away there is this buzz.WALLACE: At UConn, it's almost you have to be perfect or you fail. How do you get them to deal with that kind of pressure? That's different than just being winning. That's being perfect.AURIEMMA: I came across a great quote recently and it said perfection is the enemy of reality. But along the way, hey, as long as, you know what I say, Chris? As long as they're keeping score, we may as well try to win, right?(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: UConn's men's basketball team also won the national championship this year. That's the second time the Huskies have held both titles at the same time. The only school ever to do so. And that's it for today. Have a great week. To all the moms out there, especially mine, happy Mother's Day. We'll see you next ""Fox News Sunday.""Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

It's the view that any health-care reform that doesn't include a public option isn't ""real"" reform and thus isn't worth doing. This mantra has become an article of faith among many Democrats who haven't necessarily thought through the matter but who take their cues from leaders advancing this argument. Unless liberals rethink this premise, and fast, Democrats will squander their best chance in a generation to end the scandal of the uninsured, bring health security to every American family and begin the long-term process of getting national health costs under control.The first fallacy of the ""public option or nothing"" mantra is the notion that we'll never cover everyone without a Medicare-style program for Americans under 65. The experiences of Switzerland and the Netherlands prove that this isn't the case. Both have pioneered market-based universal health care. Both cover all their citizens using private insurers, and they do so for much less cost -- 10 percent of gross domestic product for the Dutch and 12 percent for Switzerland, compared with 17 percent in the United States, where nearly 50 million people are still uninsured.Those countries also boast better health outcomes than we do, even when compared to states with similar demographics, such as Connecticut and Massachusetts. Sick people in both countries are pursued as customers by private insurers (rather than shunned, as they are in the United States) because health plans are paid more for sick enrollees via a government-designed system of ""risk adjustment."" The Swiss and Dutch achievements are important because conservative critics often act as though fully socialized systems, such as those in Britain and Canada, are the inevitable result of any drive for universal coverage. In fact, as these two countries show, it is possible to cover everyone without a ""big government takeover.""A related fallacy is that the public option is the most important issue to debate. It's not. The central progressive breakthrough in any reform should be to make it possible for every American to access group health coverage outside the employment setting -- access that does not currently exist but which the proposed insurance exchanges would enable. What's critical, therefore, is the structure of these exchanges and the rules about who would be eligible to use them. Such questions have received disturbingly little attention but need to be front and center. For example, some legislation proposes barring people who enjoy employer-based coverage from seeking insurance from the new exchanges; this ban should be scrapped in favor of the proposal offered by Sen. Ron Wyden, under which employees could use the cash their companies spend on their benefits to buy coverage they prefer at the exchange.I respect those in my party who seek the single-payer system into which the public option might eventually evolve. But I don't agree that it's the best answer for the United States. Though single payer has merits, especially in administrative efficiency, it is also likely to freeze in place our fragmented, uncoordinated system of fee-for-service care. It would encourage providers to goose volume (to boost their incomes) rather than improve quality and would offer greater rewards for providers of acute care when we need a fresh focus on chronic disease management. Single payer also asks government to do things I don't think it is competent to do, such as setting prices across a large swath of the health sector in ways that seem certain to create damaging rigidities or resource misallocations (as happens in Medicare).Finally, if government is the sole payer, provider payments will become even more politicized than they are today. On the eve of beneficial innovations in drug therapies, devices and cost-effective ways to deliver better care, it is ill-advised to make the government's hand too rigid. Private health plans have many flaws, to be sure, but if sensibly regulated they're likely to respond more nimbly to disperse medical innovations.Liberals should make peace with the notion that a regulated market of competing private health plans can be the vehicle for getting everyone covered. Yes, it means that unlike some other advanced countries, we'll have billions of ""health"" dollars siphoned off by middlemen and marketers. But if liberals think of it as a jobs program, they'll learn to love it. If everyone's covered and insurer ""cherry-picking"" is dead, health insurance will come to look more like a regulated utility.Those on the left still seeking incentive should consider: In 2006, Sen. Ted Kennedy urged Massachusetts Democrats to support Mitt Romney's plan for universal coverage via a competing system of regulated private insurers, paired with an individual mandate and subsidies for low earners. Kennedy knew this would become a model for a bipartisan fix for the country. Now, a Kennedy-approved model is within reach. Liberals, far from resisting it as a setback, should celebrate it as a triumph.Matt Miller, a former Clinton White House aide, is a management consultant and the author of ""The Tyranny of Dead Ideas."" In recent years he has advised and given paid speeches to doctor groups, hospitals, pharmaceutical firms and insurance companies, as well as to low-income advocacy groups promoting universal coverage.© 2009 The Washington Post Company"	1.0

Specifically, these problems include long wait times and customers being turned away due to computer problems.The public hearing proved itself to be nothing more than naked political theater by the Democratic members of the committee and a brazen election year stunt. The problems with MVC service are almost entirely caused by an outdated computer system that is 30 years old. The technology was placed in service back when drivers licenses were little more than laminated pieces of paper, not the secure documents that we rely on today to prevent identity theft, crime and terrorism.Since the beginning of the Christie administration, the MVC has made great strides in serving its customers. It has placed a greater emphasis on moving critical technology projects forward to better position the commission for the future. We have finally restarted much-needed upgrades that were put on hold during the Codey and Corzine administrations.Year after year, during budget hearings, those of us who serve on the budget committees were told about major MVC technology investments, such as the Motor Vehicle Automated Transaction System (MATRX) and the Enhanced Digital Driver License (EDDL), which were planned to improve customer service and make the MVC computers more reliable. The proposed introduction of an extended six-year license, along with plans to implement online license renewals, were meant to be positive changes for New Jersey drivers. Those changes would make renewing easier and would reduce customer volume spikes and long lines at MVC offices. In reality, projections about the effects of a six-year license were off, implementation of the new digital driver license was greatly delayed and customer volume spikes and long lines exist to this day.Had the EDDL project moved forward within the planned time frame under previous administrations, a contract would have been awarded in August 2008. Under this timeline, online renewals would have been in place by late 2009, and the delays caused by the outdated, unreliable technology would not continue to occur.While previous governors never made improving customer service at the MVC a priority, the Christie administration has been proactive in addressing short-term MVC needs while it works to complete its long-term technological improvements. MVC office hours have been increased 20 percent to 54.5 hours per week more hours than ever before and include the restoration of service on Mondays. Additional staff is being added at high-volume MVC offices to speed up transactions, and additional cameras that are needed to issue drivers licenses are being installed, as well. And to ensure that customers are not left waiting in line exposed to the elements, MVC office space is being rearranged to shelter more customers comfortably indoors while they are waiting to be served.These changes will yield near immediate results in improving the customer experience at MVC offices and are the best short-term options available to remedy a bad situation left by previous governors and Motor Vehicle commissioners. But they are just that: short-term solutions. The key to modernizing the MVC and solving its problems in the long term lies in updated technology. Gov. Christie is fixing the problems left by other governors who failed to bring the MVCs computer technology up to modern standards. The dramatic change at the MVC is not just about this administrations push to introduce new technology, but also a number of other positive steps designed to better serve its customers. From instituting the greatest number of agency service hours in motor vehicle history and the opening of state-of-the-art facilities on state-owned land to installing more camera equipment and increasing staffing levels at our states busiest agencies, under Gov. Christies leadership, the MVC is doing whats necessary to fulfill the needs of New Jersey drivers.After all of the upgrades are completed and more services are online, the wait times at the MVC will drop significantly. In fact, most drivers will have to visit the MVC only once every eight years a welcome change from the current situation.I would have hoped that my colleagues in the Legislature who noted concerns about the MVC would have shown greater interest over the last several years when essential technology projects were languishing under previous administrations. Updating the technological capabilities of the MVC is of critical importance and should not be used for political gain. As we near the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, we should not forget that some of the hijackers used New Jersey drivers licenses to board those aircraft.Efforts like these to make the state drivers license more secure and the MVC more efficient will go a long way toward making drivers happier and New Jersey safer.Kevin OToole, a Republican, represents the 40th District in the New Jersey Senate, where he is a member of its budget and appropriations committee.Follow the Times of Trenton on Twitter. 	1.0

Howmuch has he changed the country? How much has the office changed him? We have the ""Roundtable"" standing by to debate those questions and allof the week's politics, including Harry Reid's role in the publicoption, and the GOP civil war that has forced their nominee out ofTuesday's congressional race in Upstate New York. But first, let's check in with one of the president's closestfriends and advisers, White House counselor Valerie Jarrett. Welcome to the THIS WEEK. VALERIE JARRETT, ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT FOR INTERGOVERNMENTALRELATIONS & PUBLIC LIAISON: Thank you, George. It's a pleasure to behere. STEPHANOPOULOS: Let me bring you back to one of -- probably one ofthe best moments of your life, one year ago this week, when PresidentObama accepted the verdict of the country's voters. Here is what hesaid that night. BARACK OBAMA, THEN-PRESIDENT-ELECT: Let's resist the temptation tofall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that haspoisoned our politics for so long. And while the Democratic Party haswon a great victory tonight, we do so with a measure of humility anddetermination to heal the divide that have held back our progress. STEPHANOPOULOS: One year later, the president's economic plan haspassed, but with no Republican votes in the House, only three in theSenate. It sure looks like right now no Republican support, the healthcare bills, as they are going forward in the Congress. And our polling shows that this partisan divide persists on issueafter issue after issue. Why has that core promise of the president'scampaign, healing the divide, gone unfulfilled? JARRETT: Well, you should ask that question to the RepublicanParty. I mean, frankly, just listening to the president's words again,it brought back terrific memories, and I think his message was aprofound one. And he has stayed true to that message. He has reachedout. He has listened. He has reached across the aisle. Just recently meeting with both the Democrats -- the Republicans andthe Democrats in both the House and in the Senate. His effort has beensustained throughout the year. And the fact... STEPHANOPOULOS: So the president bears no responsibility for thefailure to get Republican votes? JARRETT: Well, I think -- I think what we look to the president todo is to lead by example. He has reached out. He has listened. He hasincluded very helpful advice from the Republicans when it has beenforthcoming. But the fact... STEPHANOPOULOS: But not their ideas in the legislation.. JARRETT: Well, actually, that's not true. There have been examplesof where he has included their ideas. And ultimately whether they votefor a piece of legislation or not, doesn't mean that it hasn't been anopen and fruitful process. STEPHANOPOULOS: So the president doesn't feel he needs to changethe way he does business at all, to reach out more to Republicans, toget more Republicans buy-in? JARRETT: Oh, George, listen. He is constantly reaching out toRepublicans. Both he and his team. And he will continue to do that. But ultimately it's up to the Republicans to decide if they want to be aconstructive force and come to the table and work with us in a positive way. We want to hear good ideas. The president is known for listeningmost closely to those with whom he disagrees. So the door is always open. STEPHANOPOULOS: Does that mean, for example, that Speaker Pelosishould give the Republicans a vote on an alternative in health care? JARRETT: I'm not going to in any way comment on what the speakershould do. She is an extraordinary leader and she is going to continueto do that. And she is going to reach out in a way that she deemsappropriate. But your question is what is the president's leadership about it,and hearkening back to the message from last year, and I think he hasbeen consistent not just here, domestically, but also around the worldin the way he has reached out. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, to follow through, shouldn't he ask thespeaker then to give Republicans a vote? JARRETT: To give them a vote and give them a voice. It gives theman opportunity to contribute constructively. That doesn't mean that youactually have to change what you think is in the best interests of theAmerican people simply to get a Republican vote. What you do is you reach out, you listen, you collaborate, butultimately, the president is accountable to the Republican people -- tothe American people, sorry. STEPHANOPOULOS: Let's talk about this election coming up Tuesday inUpstate New York. The president created a vacancy by making John McHugh-- Congressman John McHugh, the secretary of the army. And now thereappears to be a bit of a Republican civil war going on there. TheRepublican nominee, Dede Scozzafava, was forced out of the race by aconservative challenger. And I know that the president's political team is hoping to convinceher to throw her support to the Democrat, Bill Owens. Any luck on that? JARRETT: Well, we'll see. We would love to have -- of course, haveher support. And it's rather telling when the Republican Party forcesout a moderate Republican and it says I think a great deal about wherethe Republican Party leadership is right now. So of course we would love to have her support, and those are thepeople who are going to vote for her. STEPHANOPOULOS: What does it say about where the Republican Partyleadership is? JARRETT: Well, I think it's becoming more and more extreme and moreand more marginalized. Look at the number of people who actually saythat they are registered, consider themselves a Republican. And ifthat's the direction they want to go find, what we're going to do iswhat we've always done, and that is, we're going reach out, we're goingto try to include as many people to be a part of our governing process,being open, being transparent, and we're going to let the Americanpeople decide. And right now what you see is a great deal of momentum movingforward, for example, on health care. The American people want change. They don't want the same old health care system that is not affordable,that doesn't offer coverage to everybody, that keeps escalating in costs. And what we've seen from the Republicans is really a desire to havethe status quote. And, George, that's not acceptable anymore. STEPHANOPOULOS: Our latest polling shows that there is not majoritysupport for the president's health care plans. JARRETT: Well, we actually think that there is. And I suppose itdepends upon what poll you're looking at. But as more and more word hasgotten out about what health care reform is all about, whether it's ourdesire to make it affordable, whether it's to cover all people, whetherit's to make sure that people who have pre-existing conditions don'tlose their coverage, whether if somebody changes a job, they don't losetheir coverage, if somebody is unemployed they don't lose their coverage. All of these are extraordinarily important to the American people. This has been an unusual process. It has been open, it has beentransparent. Oftentimes the sausage-making in Washington is a littlebit off-putting. But look how far we've come. George, five different committees haveapproved health care. It's now being debated. And all of those fivecommittees have -- the content of those bills is consistent with whatthe president put forward. STEPHANOPOULOS: You know, you say that all five bills areconsistent with what the president has put forward, but the bill comingout of the Senate Finance Committee includes a tax on these high-pricedinsurance plans. Senator Charles Grassley, the Republican ranking member of thatcommittee has looked at Joint Tax Committee figures, and according tothose figures, it shows that 46 million families making less than$200,000 will eventually see their taxes go up under this plan. Thatwould break the president's promise not to raise any taxes on peopleearning under $250,000 a year. So how can you say that's consistent with his plan? JARRETT: Yes, well, first of all, there are lots of differentanalyses of the plans, and until we have a final bill, let's hold offprejudging what it's going to do. But the president has been clear, hedoes not want to impose a tax on the middle class. That's whyimmediately upon taking office, when the Recovery Act was passed, itprovided a tax relief to the middle class, something -- a very big pointhe made in the course of the campaign. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, then let me press this point, because it'snot just Republicans who say this. You've got union leaders like GerryMcEntee and several others have said this is also a tax increase on themiddle class. You've got 180 House Democrats who are saying the samething, saying that that's why they're opposed to it. So are you saying that the president will not sign this proposal ifit does indeed raise taxes on the middle class? JARRETT: What I'm saying to you, George, is, let's let the processgo forward. Let's not pre-judge to the end. There have been so manyconstructive conversations going on as recently as Friday with thevarious leadership in both the House and the Senate. And I think what the president has said is, look, we do not want tohave any additional tax burden on the middle class. We want to haveaffordable health care. We want to make sure that people who have nothad insurance before have it. We need to bring down the costs, becausethat's going to help our federal deficit... STEPHANOPOULOS: So if... JARRETT: All of those parameters -- and no, what I'm saying is thatI'm not going to leap forward to the end. What we're going to do... STEPHANOPOULOS: But don't you have to set the bottom line for the... JARRETT: No, no. What you do and what he has done, and what hasbrought us to the point where we are right now where we have five billsfor the first time in history, after decades of effort, what he is doingis working. And what he is doing is talking constructively. His team is up on the Hill every single day, meeting with theleadership, meeting with all of the different members. And we're goingto see where we go. And he has made it clear, as I said from theoutset, what his parameters are. And he's constantly... STEPHANOPOULOS: So he will not -- bottom line, he will not violatethat commitment, is what you're saying? JARRETT: What I'm saying is that he is confident that a bill that'sgoing to be passed is going to be consistent with his parameters, yes. STEPHANOPOULOS: OK. Let's talk about Afghanistan for a second. Wesee today the opposition candidate to President Karzai, AbdullahAbdullah, has said he's not going to run in the run-off. Is this awelcome development or is the White House worried the questions aboutthis election will cast a cloud over President Karzai and make it moredifficult for the president to implement his strategy? JARRETT: We don't think that it's going to add a complication tothe strategy. It's up to the Afghan people and their authorities todecide how to proceed going forward. We watched the election verycarefully. And we're going to work with the leader of the Afghangovernment and hopefully that's going to improve the state of conditionsfor the people in Afghanistan, and also help us as we try to bring thiswar to a close. STEPHANOPOULOS: So this is not a complication as far as you see it? JARRETT: No. We don't see it as a complication. STEPHANOPOULOS: And we also -- we're getting some word followingthe president's meeting with the joint chiefs on Friday that the targetdate for announcing this decision may be slipping a bit. The presidentwants some more information from the Joint Chiefs. Is it now possible that it's going to come after the presidentreturns from Asia, more like the end of November than the middle? JARRETT: What the president has said consistently is he is goingthrough a very rigorous process. George, before he puts our men andwomen in harm's way, he wants to make absolutely sure that he has astrategy. This isn't just a matter of how many troops are sent over. Although that is a very important component. We have to look at what's going on on the ground. We have to lookat what our allies are doing. We have to look at the state of thegovernment in Afghanistan. And he's looking for a strategy that leadsto keeping our nation safe. And so the timing for that is completely upto the president, who makes the decision when he is confident that hehas all of the facts that he needs to make the right decision for ourcountry. STEPHANOPOULOS: So it could be later in the month. Let me just -- also this week the president went to Dover. And wewant to show our audience some of the pictures from that. The presidentseemed -- did seem quite moved, almost stricken at times during thatvisit. It had quite an impact on the president, didn't it? JARRETT: How could it not? I mean, my goodness, to meet thefamilies of people who have given their lives, the maximum sacrifice toour country? Of course he was deeply moved by the experience. Anyonewho was there would have to be. STEPHANOPOULOS: Did you have a chance to talk to him about it andhow do you think it will affect his decision-making? JARRETT: I think that he is going to make the decision that he --that he thinks is right for the American people. It certainly is areminder of what is at stake. And you talk about 40,000 troops, behindevery troop is a family. And it's a huge sacrifice that we're askingour men and women to make. And I think going to Dover and showing respect on behalf of ourcountry for that sacrifice was something that was very important to thepresident. But ultimately he is going to make the decision that hethinks is going to keep our country safe. STEPHANOPOULOS: One final question, the president received bothpraise and criticism for doing that visit with television camerasthere. Why was it important for the president to do that somewhat inpublic? JARRETT: Well, he wouldn't have done it in public if the familieshad objected. So the first and foremost thing is what is important tothe families. And I think that it's important for us all to recognizewhat is at stake. And so when you talk about numbers, like 40,000troops, as I said a minute ago, I think it's a reminder about how deepthe sacrifice is. And it's something that's open and transparent, and it was a way forhim as the president to convey to those families on behalf of theAmerican people how much we appreciate that enormous sacrifice they'vemade. STEPHANOPOULOS: Valerie Jarrett, thanks very much. JARRETT: You're welcome. Good to see you. STEPHANOPOULOS: We're going to go straight to the roundtable, so asour panelists take their seats, we have a little bookend to thatelection night excerpt we showed from President Obama. Gracious wordsfrom Senator McCain. SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R-AZ), THEN-REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:Senator Obama and I have and argued our differences, and he hasprevailed. No doubt many of those differences remain. These aredifficult times for our country. And I pledge to him tonight to do allin my power to help and lead us through the many challenges we face. STEPHANOPOULOS: We're going to go straight to the roundtable, soas our panelists take their seats, we have a little bookend to thatelection night excerpt we showed from President Obama. Gracious wordsfrom Senator McCain. MCCAIN: Senator Obama and I have and argued our differences, andhe has prevailed. No doubt many of those differences remain. Theseare difficult times for our country. And I pledge to him tonight todo all in my power to help and lead us through the many challenges weface. STEPHANOPOULOS: One year ago this week. With that, let me bringin our roundtable. I am joined as always by George Will; EdGillespie, counselor to President George W. Bush; Ron Brownstein ofthe National Journal; Dee Dee Myers, press secretary to Bill Clinton;and the Reverend Al Sharpton. Welcome to all of you. And let me just begin with the threshold question. We're about ayear out from the election. Has the president delivered on thatpromise of change? WILL: I think domestically and in foreign policy, he has. Hisone great achievement is to enhance the status of the United States. Now, that happens to have zero cash value, it turns out. TheIranians, the North Koreans, the Afghan government, China and Indiaregarding carbon limitations -- he's made no progress on any of thesefronts, but people like us better. So I suppose that's anachievement. SHARPTON: I think he absolutely has changed -- I agree withGeorge. He's changed the perception of America. I think that he'salso changed some things here, the economy. When you look at the GDP,up 3.5. When you look at 30-year mortgages at a lower rate than it'sever been... STEPHANOPOULOS: Be careful there. Unemployment almost 10percent. SHARPTON: Unemployment -- again, the hardest thing once youbring an economy back, is the jobs. I think he has to finish thetask. Let's remember, George, he's only been there 10 months aspresident. In nine months, he's helped restore America's image, he'shelped to stop the hemorrhaging of jobs, and bring the economy back. So in nine months, what it usually takes to make a baby, he's startingthe rebirth of America. STEPHANOPOULOS: And Ed Gillespie, I was thinking of you asValerie Jarrett was here talking. Basically, her answer on why thispartisan divide hasn't healed at all is it was the Republicans' fault. GILLESPIE: Right. Well, it's always the Republicans' fault ifyou listen to this White House, and I think that's one of thedisappointments, I think, frankly, for a lot of us Republicans,independents, is that this has not been a post-partisan presidency, aswe were led to believe. In fact, it's been a very partisan WhiteHouse, very political in its nature. And just, for example, I've heard Valerie Jarrett say, well, interms of health care reform, you know, no Republican support. Well,look at what's happened in that debate. The things that got OlympiaSnowe's vote in the United States Senate, they dropped and so yet theycontend they're looking for Republican support. They eliminated theone Republican they had a shot of getting so far. The president inhis Joint Session speech talked about medical liability reform. ThePelosi bill punishes states that put a limit on attorney's fees or puta cap on damages. So when you look at their actions relative to therhetoric, I think that accounts for the bipartisanship. STEPHANOPOULOS: I want to get more to health care later. Butfirst, Dee Dee, on this broader question, the president obviously camein with more popular support than Bill Clinton had in 1993 but similarnumbers in both the House and the Senate. And they did seem to makethe choice, not unlike the choice in 1993/'94 to secure the Democraticbase first on their big pieces of legislation. MYERS: Well, I think after some consultation in the early weeksand months, they ran up against the reality. It's true the presidenthas in some ways changed the tone, but he's also in these nine shortmonths, 10 short months shown the limitations of bipartisanship. Youcan talk a good game, you can go meet with people and you realizethey're just not going to be for you and so that leaves you noalternative than to secure your base. You have to get the votes outof your base. And if you can pick off one or two people in the middlelike Olympia Snowe, moderate Republican, to call the bill bipartisan,great. But if not, then you have to be able to pass legislation withDemocrats. BROWNSTEIN: These are much more structural problems than reallydealing with one president in their control. We are moving muchcloser to something like a parliamentary system in this country whereeach party is now much more the base, the coalition is much moreideologically homogeneous than it was a generation ago and that exertstremendous and typical pressure for legislators on one side to standwith their side against the other on almost every major issue. I think Obama wants to bring in Republicans but he wants to do soby addition. He's willing to add Republican ideas, I think, to hispackage. Republicans need -- really need subtraction. I mean that even if, for example, you have medical malpracticereform in the health care bill, there are very few Republicans todaywho could vote for an individual mandate, which is the cornerstone ofthe bill, even though that was the Republican alternative to HillaryClinton's plan in 1993. I think the parties are structurally moving apart, and it is verydifficult for either side to win substantial support on theirlegislative priorities from the other. That is just a reality of ourpolitics today. MYERS: But it's worth noting that twice as many people, Americanpeople, think Obama and the Democrats have tried harder to reachacross the aisle than Republicans. WILL: But the reality is the Democrats have a very clear agenda,unified theory of this administration and it is equality, understoodas equality of outcome. And, therefore, every proposal the presidenthas from dealing with General Motors to the United Autoworkers tohealth care is to increase the number of Americans equally dependenton the federal government for more and more things. And I don't thinkthe American people at the end of the day want that. SHARPTON: Well, I think that you cannot get by Dee Dee's point. I think that the American people have said very, very clearly thatthey think that this administration and the Democrats have been theones to reach out. We're waiting to see the Republican that emergesthat reaches back. Even on education reform, the president has NewtGingrich and I touring together. I mean, you can't reach out morethan to try to get Newt Gingrich and I to go on tour together. I think that he has reached out. I think at some point, therewill be a tremendous backlash on the Republicans when they don't reachback. And I think that that is the problem that they're having in alot of these pollings that we're seeing. BROWNSTEIN: I was going to say, look, the president has had somesuccess and broadening his coalition outside of Congress. He has hadmore success than Clinton did at bringing in business interests onreally all of the major initiatives whether it's on cap and trade withsome of the major utilities... STEPHANOPOULOS: Or health care policy. BROWNSTEIN: But the underlying fact I think is George is correctwhether you characterize it the way he did or not, what Obama and theDemocrats want to do and what the Republicans fundamentally want to doat this point, the gulf is so large, it is very difficult to see themcoming together in meaningful numbers. And if you say what Obama has done in nine months, he really haschanged the frame of debate. The stimulus plan included more net newpublic investment and the things that Democrats prize, like education,alternative energy than Clinton was able to achieve in his eightyears. And let's not forget that he is within sight now of a health carebill that has defeated every president who has tried it since FranklinRoosevelt. So he is changing the terms of the debate. There arepolitical costs, we'll talk about those later, but he is shifting whatwe're discussing and what the solutions we're discussing are. STEPHANOPOULOS: One area where we've seen less change thanactually I would have expected is on the issue of race relations inthe United States. Remarkable poll from the Gallup organization thisweek. They asked, ""Do you think that relations between blacks andwhites will always be a problem for the United States, or that asolution will eventually be worked out?"" You go back to December1963, 42 percent thought it would be a problem, 55 percent thought itwould eventually be worked out. By November 2008, the number thoughta year ago on Election Day, it would be a problem, had gone down quitea bit. STEPHANOPOULOS: And the number who thought it would be workedout had gone up. But look at October 2009, right back to where we were, basically,in November 1963, despite all the changes we've had in those times,Reverend Sharpton. SHARPTON: Because I think the structural inequality is stillthere. The reality is that you still see the race gap in education,in employment, in health care. And I think the reality has sobered alot of people up. I think what the president has done is tried to reach out andbring people together, and I think everyone appreciates that. But Ithink people are looking at the reality. So a year after his election, with all the hope of Americanscoming together and the great symbolism of having an African-Americanpresident, I don't think we've lost that; I think we just sobered upto the reality. We've learned that he can't walk on water, but he'sstill the best swimmer in national politics. STEPHANOPOULOS: Best swimmer, George? WILL: When a poll shows something that is so obviouslypreposterous, they ought to go back and look at the poll. The VotingRights Act, public accommodations act, enormous changes in educationin the United States, access to college -- we've made enormousstrides. And for them to say essentially nothing has changed is justnonsense. Watch the election in Atlanta this week. WILL: ... mayor. A black city may be about to elect, for thefirst time in, what, two generations, a white mayor. Now, thatindicates a, kind of, coming of the real color-blind nature of ourpolitics. MYERS: The same thing may (ph) happen in Atlanta. GILLESPIE: No, I think -- the (inaudible), George, is that it's-- we're moving the goal posts in a good way. You know, we've alwaysgot to do better, but the fact is, I can tell you, my children havegrown up in a more color-blind society than I grew up in, and I grewup in a more color-blind society than my parents grew up in. And wehave made great progress. The election of President Obama was a proud moment for the UnitedStates of America in that regard. But, that said, I think what you see is an American public thatsays, you know what, we've got to keep striving. And I think that's apositive thing. BROWNSTEIN: Each cohort -- each younger cohort in American lifeis more diverse than the one older. We are becoming inexorably a morediverse society. This was the first election in American history morethan a quarter of the voters were nonwhite. That number isn't goingdown. It's only going up. Now, having said that, there is a red flag out there that goesback to what George was saying before, I think. There are very --there are divergent views between white and nonwhite America over therole of government, and that is widening at a really -- almost at anominous rate. I mean, white America is moving, I think, by and large, in avery, kind of, Perot-esque direction. There is, kind of, a backlashagainst some of the ambition of what Obama is pursuing and theDemocrats pursuing across the board, whereas there is much moretolerance in nonwhite America for a larger, more expansive federalrole. And that skepticism about institutions that you see in big chunksof the white electorate, contrasted with the support in the nonwhiteelectorate, is, kind of, an unstable phenomenon. STEPHANOPOULOS: It's going to reach such tension next year, asthe president goes forward. We're going to take a break in just aminute. Before we do, there's a new book out by President Obama'scampaign manager, David Bluff -- Plouffe -- called ""The Audacity toWin."" And, Reverend Sharpton, there's a fascinating little excerptabout you in the book. He describes a moment on Christmas Eve 2007,very close race in Iowa, where President -- then Senator Obama callsPlouffe as Plouffe is in church, because he's worried -- he's gottenword that you might be coming to Iowa, and that is not entirely goodnews for him. On the one hand, if you're coming to endorse Hillary Clinton,they're fine with that, but they felt that, if you were coming toendorse him, it might create problems for Obama that they didn't want. The way it ends us, you don't come. They say you played aconstructive role the rest of the campaign. What happened? SHARPTON: There was a group that tried to get me to come in, andI think they were -- this was at the time when they were trying toreally go for these race politics and miscast... STEPHANOPOULOS: Coming for Obama. SHARPTON: No, they wanted me to come in, period, on a raceissue, which, really, you'd have to be hard-pressed to really dealwith that in Iowa. But we determined it was a distraction (inaudible). And I pickedup the phone and called then-Senator Obama and said, I'm not going tobe used like that. And I've worked, as they said, constructivelythroughout the rest of the campaign. Because, even though he and I may not agree on every strategy, Ithink that, once you decide you want to work with someone, you do whatis best, whether you're out front or behind the scenes. STEPHANOPOULOS: OK, we're going to take a quick break. We'll beback with more roundtable in just a minute, and later, the Sundayfunnies. DAVID LETTERMAN, HOST, ""THE LATE SHOW"": Because of the weatherand due to the low ceiling -- listen to this -- earlier this afternoona Northwest Airline airplane, passenger plane, accidentally landed atthe correct airport. STEPHEN COLBERT, DAILY SHOW: Staunch conservative George Willhas for the last two Sundays on ABC's THIS WEEK wore a long tie. Clearly his bow ties were the only thing tethering George Will toreality. WILL: Marijuana is getting much better. COLBERT: Then he tried to eat George Stephanopoulos because hethought he was a teddy graham. WILL: We legalized prostitution, as anyone who opens a telephonebook and looks under escort can tell you. COLBERT: I don't now which is more disturbing, that George Willgoes to prostitutes or that he still uses the phone book. STEPHANOPOULOS: George Will's star turn on ""Comedy Central,"" youand Steve Colbert. I want to bring you back in here along with Ed Gillespie, RonBrownstein, Dee Dee Myers and the Reverend Al Sharpton. I could askyou to respond but we can go straight to the politics of the week. First time I've ever seen George Will blush. STEPHANOPOULOS: A lot of elections coming up this week. Let'sshow the latest polling in these gubernatorial races and importantcongressional race. No. 1, down in Virginia, Creigh Deeds, theDemocrat, about 10 points behind in the latest ""Washington Post"" pollto Bob McDonnell, the Republican. Up in New Jersey, Jon Corzine, the incumbent, 43 percent, ChrisChristie, Republican, 38 percent and Independent Chris Daggett has 13percent. That race really too close to call according to most of thepolling right now. And then this congressional district up in upstate New York, NewYork 23. John McHugh left to become secretary of the army. It was adead heat according to the poll that came out from the Siena ResearchInstitute yesterday between the Democrat Bill Owens, the conservativecandidate, Doug Hoffman, the Republican Dede Scozzafava was far behindat 20 percent. And yesterday, George Will, she dropped out of the race. A lotof big Republican power brokers had come in on either side of thisrace. Sarah Palin came in for the conservative candidate. So did TimPawlenty. Newt Gingrich, the former speaker came in on behalf ofScozzafava and he said something interesting in ""The New York Times""this morning. And he said, he warned about an impending civil war inthe Republican Party. He said ""If we get into a cycle where everytime one side loses they run a third-party candidate, we'll makePelosi speaker for life and guarantee Obama's re-election."" WILL: If they had done what Newt Gingrich urged them to do inthat district, the district probably would have gone to a Democrat andwould have lost a seat. Newt was just tone deaf as were the peoplewho picked this woman. Who is a candidate of among other things theworking families party which is a wholly owned subsidiary of thePublic Employees Union. She's for tax increases, same-sex marriage. She's for abolishing the right of secret ballot in union elections. There's already a party for people who think like that. It's calledthe Democratic Party. MYERS: It was interesting that she was chosen by the countyparty chairs, 11 people got in a back room and chose her for somereasons that may have to do with state party politics and not to dowith winning. But there's no question -- it will be very interestingto see what lessons both Democrats and particularly Republicans takefrom this. Is this going to be a carte blanche for conservatives totake on more moderate incumbents in primaries? GILLESPIE: Well, look, Dee Dee's point is a very important one. This nominee, Scozzafava was chosen by 11 people behind closed doors. STEPHANOPOULOS: It was a caucus process, wasn't it? GILLESPIE: It's a process but it doesn't make it a good one. The fact is that a lot of Republicans said, wait a second, she wasn'ta moderate Republican as George pointed out. She is a liberalRepublican. Daily Kos, the left wing Web site endorsed her over theDemocrat. The fact is I think Republicans, many of whom support herbecause she was the Republican Party nominee, and there is anobligation that have you in the party to support the nominee arerelieved today at the opportunity to pick up this seat now. And I think that if you look at the 20 percent that Scozzafavawas getting in that poll, I suspect that breaks about 3-1 to Hoffmanat the end of the day. STEPHANOPOULOS: And Ron, the Republicans almost certainly willnow win. BROWNSTEIN: It seems the momentum is there. It sends a mixedmessage for Republicans out of this. On the one hand, I think it'sgoing to be another indication, I think we'll see others on Tuesday,that there is energy in the small government, anti-spending argumentat this point. On the other hand, the fall of the Dede as I think she's knownnow, I think is a sign that the leash that the base is holding on theparty is tightening and that the Palins, the talk radio, the RushLimbaughs, the FOX, the definition of what is acceptable as aRepublican I think is narrowing. I mean this does come after Arlen Specter essentially was forcedto leave the party after voting for the stimulus, after Chuck Grassleyfaced threats, open threats of a primary challenge if he compromisedwith Max Baucus. In the long run -- in the short run, there's clear energy here inthe small government, anti-government argument. But in the long run,I do wonder about whether Republicans are going to have the freedom ofmaneuver they'll need to recover in some of those blue states wherethey've significantly eroded. GILLESPIE: I think they will. Let's understand something. Thisis a conservative district. This is a district where a conservative-- this is not some swing district where having a moderate Republican,not a liberal Republican, but a moderate Republican who may vary withthe party on some things has a better change of winning here. GILLESPIE: ... conservative Republican. GILLESPIE: I agree, but I just -- I don't think it's right toread too much into New York 23, in terms of this civil war that I'mreading about... SHARPTON: Newt Gingrich was the one that said it. And I thinkwe should read all we could. I encourage civil war all over the Republican Party. And I'm very encouraged, on a Sunday morning, to hear you, Ed,admit that the Republicans' candidates are chosen by these 11 guys atthe top. GILLESPIE: Not always. SHARPTON: And I hope the masses of the Republicans rebel anddivide all over the country. GILLESPIE: My point, Reverend, is that was the exception. That's one of the things -- you know, usually, our nominees comethrough a primary process where the voters have a chance to expressthemselves. MYERS: Really important point, which is the Democratic Part wasable to take back the House in 2006 with a big-tent strategy, byopening the party to people who didn't agree on every ideological --you know, the Heath Shulers of the world. Will the Republicans be able to do that, if they want to win backthe House in 2010? GILLESPIE: One of the points I make, Dee Dee, all the time, is,look, if you look at what the Democrats did, they were very smartabout it. They did get districts, one, carried by people in Oklahoma,Texas, other places, predominantly Catholic areas, where they mightnot agree on abortion as the party platform. But in doing so, in winning the majority in the House, they didnot -- their party did not move to the right. The Democratic Party,if anything, moved to the left in that process. So I think there's alesson we've learned there. STEPHANOPOULOS: You're now going to see this play out in otherraces. We've Marco Rubio challenging Governor Crist for the Senate. STEPHANOPOULOS: He will win? WILL: Absolutely. Absolutely, he'll win. STEPHANOPOULOS: Against the popular governor of Florida, thestate of Florida? WILL: Look -- look what the local caucuses are saying in theirstraw polls. Look at who votes in an off-year, closed primary. Itwill be the ideologically intense, and Rubio will get them. BROWNSTEIN: You know, the problem with the civil war metaphor isit implies two equal armies contesting on the battlefield. There isnot a civil war in the Republican Party. You have a dominant conservative wing that is a larger share ofthe Republican coalition, by far, than the liberals are, by the way,of the Democratic coalition. And then you have, kind of, a moderateto liberal -- not even liberal -- remnant that is declining ininfluence. And the -- and the ability of the moderate side of the party, Ithink, to, kind of, shape the definition or the image of the party isvery limited. And I think what you saw -- I agree with you; New York 23 is aconservative place. You can't read too much into it. But I think itis part of an overall continuum in which, after Bush, after McCain,the conservative part of the party is saying, look, we lost notbecause we were too moderate but because we were -- not because wewere too conservative; because we were too moderate. And I think they will -- I think there is going to be a tightleash on Republican leaders in terms of how far they can deviate froma small government message in the next couple years. WILL: Independents -- independents are moving to the right indroves. Gallup says the number of Americans who identify themselvesas liberal is down 20. Those identifying as conservative, Reverend,are up to 40. That's two times 20. SHARPTON: Well, I'm a conservative. I want to conserve voterrights. I want to conserve women's rights. WILL: You don't want to conserve voting rights for unionmembers. SHARPTON: I think you've got to redefine what conservatives are,now. I think that a lot of what people who used to call themselvesconservatives, they're the extremists. They want to change America asit has become. I think we are now the conservatives. We're trying toconserve the America of the last 40 years that is making the progressyou talked about. STEPHANOPOULOS: One feeling I think a lot of those conservativeshave -- I mean, and you see this across the polling -- independentsare going up in every poll. But these are, as Ron suggests, is Perot-like independents, really, really angry, right now. And that couldcost Jon Corzine from your neighboring state, New Jersey, his race,even though he's ahead right now. SHARPTON: I think unfairly so. But I think you're right. Ithink that Corzine was impacted in his tenure as governor by whathappened in terms of the national economy and things that were beyondhis control. I have been in New Jersey. And I've been on the ground there,and I think that the problem there is trying to get that messagethrough and to really raise a lot of the things concretely that he diddo in the state. And I think that is going to be a close election. And I thinkhe'll win. STEPHANOPOULOS: But in that state, you've also, though, got moreof a moderate Republican challenging the Republican nominee, and he'scosting Chris Christie, the Republican, how many votes, as well. GILLESPIE: For right now... STEPHANOPOULOS: Third party. GILLESPIE: Yes, a third-party candidate. But, look,independents -- New Jersey's the first state in the union with aplurality of registered independent voters. They tend to be -- havebeen leaning Democrat for years, but they are fed up with thespending. They are fed up with the taxes. They're tired of seeingbusinesses run out of the state and they're tired of seeing one-partyrule in Trenton. And what we're seeing now is a reaction to that. And we've gotwind at our back for Chris Christie. I think Daggett's numbers willcome down between now and Tuesday, and they will accrue to -- theywill go to Christie. BROWNSTEIN: You know, you -- I think you are going to see somewarning signs for Democrats out of this election. I mean, you canmake too much of these -- these off-year elections, but in 2006 and2008 Democrats won independents substantially, both in the state racesand at the presidential level. In the last polls these week, in all three, Virginia, New Jersey,and New York 23, independents are moving toward the Republicans,largely, I think, around a size-of-government, scale-of-government,cost-of-agenda argument. I think you're going to see more pressurefrom Democratic centrists next year as the result for some kind ofdeficit reduction. STEPHANOPOULOS: I want to get into that, because... BROWNSTEIN: Can I just -- one quick point, having said that,President Obama's approval rating has stabilized over 50 percent withunemployment at 9.8 percent. When unemployment hit 9.8 percent underRonald Reagan in July '82, he was at 41 percent approval. There isstill a substantial base that supports Obama that puts him in adifferent position than Clinton was in, both legislatively andpolitically heading into that first midterm. STEPHANOPOULOS: Right now I think that's exactly right. I thinkthe other thing you're going to hear from Democrats, Dee Dee, if,indeed, Republicans win in both New Jersey and Virginia, is that inthese off-year elections, those states always go to the out-party. But if both states, both Virginia and New Jersey, go to theRepublicans, that could have an impact on this health care debate. MYERS: It could. You know, it could make a lot of Democrats --or moderate Democrats in both the House and Senate very nervous. Imean, there is backlash against -- this can't be completely attributedto a bad economy and to an unpopular incumbent in New Jersey. There is something afoot in the land that people areuncomfortable about, and one of the issues is spending. And that'sprobably the biggest issue. WILL: Well, that's right. I mean they've seen, A, on Friday, wehad the biggest contraction of the stock market in six months. Thejobs numbers come out, and they say, well, the GDP is growing. Peoplesay, well, so what, where are the jobs? We've had ""Cash forClunkers,"" which was a government-engineered automotive bubble thatpromptly collapsed. Our next stroke of genius in managing the economy from Washingtonwill probably be to extend the $8,000 tax credit for first-time ormultiple-time home-buyers, which is to say a government subsidy to getpeople into houses they cannot afford to be in. GILLESPIE: And by the way, the ""Cash for Clunkers,"" you know,which was a vaunted success supposedly, it turns out each of thesecars, apparently, $24,000 per car is the estimated cost of these. Thejobs that they attribute to stimulus, $71,500 per job. We're lookingat now having $540,000 per household in debt imposed by thisadministration. That is jarring to people, and the jobs aren't there. The fact is, is that we saw Jared Bernstein, a White Houseeconomic adviser, on TV last week say that they expect job creation tobegin the second half of next year, eight months from now. STEPHANOPOULOS: Of course, what the White House says and theireconomic advisers say is that without these programs that we wouldhave had 2 or 3 percent less... SHARPTON: And no one is more concerned about the 9.8unemployment rate than I am. But at the same time, you have to stopthe job loss. I live in New York. People forget that when we saw theWall Street companies go down, the financial services jobs thatordinary people lost on the ground, we had to stop the hemorrhaging. And I think that a lot of Americans which is why President Obama'spoll numbers are staying as high as they are, understand that heinherited a bad hand. He got the key to the bank with no money in the vault and thepeople that took the money are asking him, why aren't we makingwithdrawals? I think he has got to deal with what he was handed, andI think that that it is not just blaming the Republicans, it'sreality. He was handed a bad hand. BROWNSTEIN: You know, there's a short term and a long term arcto be looking at here. I think that in the near term you do havemovement among independents toward a -- especially white independents,toward a more skeptical Perot-esque view of government, and you add tothat the fact that the electorate in 2010 is going to be older andwhiter than the electorate in 2008, and younger and non-white votersare the core of the Democratic Party. That kind of adds up to whatcould be a difficult election in 2010. But if you look over the longer arc toward 2012, I do have towonder if Republicans are drawing the right lessons here, because insome ways they are responding to Obama's effort to expand governmentby becoming more aggressive in their proposals to retrench (ph)government. You had four-fifths of House Republicans vote this spring toconvert Medicare into a voucher for everybody under 55. And you'vehad three-quarters of House and Senate Republicans vote this year tolower the top marginal tax rate for the wealthiest to 25 percent, thelowest level since 1931. Now that's not going to be part of the debate in 2010. It'sgoing to be a referendum on Democrats. But when you get to 2012, ifthat is the trajectory of the party, I think Obama has an excellentchance of recapturing some of those independents who are skeptical. STEPHANOPOULOS: A lot will depend on whether health care passes,and what kind of impact it has had on people by 2012, as well. Andthis week we did see some major movement. You saw the House ofRepresentatives announce their bill, also Senator Harry Reid on thiswhole issue of the public option, choosing to side with his Democraticbase rather than Olympia Snowe, who the president had decided to gowith on the public option. Yet what he couldn't say at the end of that press conference wasthat he had the votes to get this to the floor and pass it. SEN. HARRY REID (D-NV), MAJORITY LEADER: We have 60 people inthe caucus, it's -- the comfort level is kind of -- we all hugtogether and see where we come out. STEPHANOPOULOS: A gamble forced by necessity, right, George? WILL: Yes. Now the president has now declared swine flu anemergency because the government hasn't done very well in coping withan epidemic we saw coming. Now at this very moment we're saying whatwe ought to do is expand radically the role of government in handlinghealth care. At the last count I heard, this 15,000 -- 1,500-page bill has theword ""shall"" in it. ""You shall do this."" ""Government shall do this."" ""States shall do."" That's the polite way of saying, ""must,"" 3,425times. WILL: And they say this is not government takeover of the healthcare system? It's preposterous. SHARPTON: It is government protection of citizens, 50 millionpeople uninsured, with all of the... WILL: Fifty? The president says 30. SHARPTON: ... 47, if you want to be exact. I don't have theexact numbers of how many times ""shall"" is in the bill, so let me beexact with... ... 47 million people uninsured who have not been protected andwho, I might add, in the Reagan years, Bush senior and Bush junioryears, it just sat there. I think the fact that this president has been able to move a -- adialogue forward and different manifestations of a health care packageto where it has passed five committees and we're on our way to somekind of movement, here, is nothing short of amazing. And I think that he ought to be saluted for that. The Americanpeople should be protected by the government. STEPHANOPOULOS: Democrats are convinced that failure here is notan option and that victory will put to rest a lot of the anxiety thatpeople have right now. Yet, at the same time, you're likely to see,if this bill does go through, at least over the next year or so,premiums continue to go up. Yet voters will also, for the first time,say they can't be denied health insurance if they're sick. So how does that trade-off work? GILLESPIE: I think -- George, I am stunned by this, I have tosay. I always thought, and I've said, you know, before, here, that Ithought that they would get to a bill that they could pass that hadbipartisan support, that was scaled back, that didn't have the publicoption. They have gone whole hog. This bill is a monstrosity. And froma Republican perspective, if you look at the mandates in it, the taxesin it, the cutting of Medicare for seniors, the federal funding ofabortion, it is -- I feel like one of those old game shows, where youtake the shopping cart down the aisle and try and scoop it all in, interms of trying to pick out, where do you hone in on this... STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes it is rolling toward passage. MYERS: It is rolling toward passage. And I think, you know,Senator -- what are Senator Reid's motives in approaching the publicoption this way? Well, part of it is back-home politics. He's in a very tough re-election. His state supports the public option, so he's taken a moreaggressive position. I don't think anybody believes there's enough votes in the Senateto pass this. So what's the fall-back plan? An opt-in, which bringsback Olympia Snowe. I think it's entirely possible that they passthis. GILLESPIE: But if they vote in the House on this bill, let metell you, it would be like the BTU of '93. And I've got to say... MYERS: They're a little smarter about that now. GILLESPIE: I've never felt this -- this is the first time I'vethought of this, but I've got to tell you something. I know that theywere willing to sacrifice 20 conservative Democrats, or moderateDemocrats, to get this done. I think they risk losing the House ifthey try to pass this bill and they jam it through the way it'swritten. MYERS: That's not going to pass the Senate, so we know that'snot going to... GILLESPIE: But it's going to pass the House, and those Housemembers are going to have voted for all these things. MYERS: It will depend on what gets worked out in the Senatebefore they go to vote in the House. BROWNSTEIN: Can I just make two quick points? I mean, your point about, sort of, the throwing everything in theshopping car -- the core of this bill, an individual mandate, amandate on individuals to buy insurance in return for fundamentalinsurance reform, paid for by slowing the growth of Medicare spendingis the John Chafee/Bob Dole alternative to Hillary Clinton in 1993. And it says something about the evolution of the party that,regardless of what else was in there, the individual mandate by itselfwould be a bridge too far for almost... STEPHANOPOULOS: Just stop there one second. Because I want --that's -- you're right. On the other hand, now let's go hardballpolitics. When this is in an election context next year, what youhave for the House members to (inaudible) they're going to be saddledwith $400 billion in Medicare cuts, and if this tax on high-pricedinsurance plans passes, something that a lot of their own supporterswill call a middle-class tax increase. How do you fight that? BROWNSTEIN: Yes. The heart -- the heart of the choice is goingto be whether George or Al are right -- Reverend Sharpton -- is rightabout what Americans want from government. Because what you are saying is that there's a fundamentallyReaganite moment, here, in which people are saying, look, governmentis just doing too much and we want it rolled back. What you're saying is that people are angry that government seemsto be protecting the rich and not doing anything for me. And to theextent that Obama and the Democrats can portray health care assomething that's not for Wall Street but helping to provide securityfor middle-class Americans, they have a better chance of selling itthan it might now appear. WILL: Here is why we have two parties. The Reverend Sharptonsay the American people need protected by government. Some of usthink we need protected from government. BROWNSTEIN: And that's the core of the argument. SHARPTON: But you guys lost the election a year ago, so I thinkthe American people have spoken on that... WILL: The Constitution is very picky about this. We keep havingelections. SHARPTON: Every four years. We have three left. WILL: Two years -- every two years. STEPHANOPOULOS: So are you worried about this wave, if EdGillespie -- is Ed Gillespie right, if this passes, that Democratscould lose the House? SHARPTON: I think that I'm concerned how it comes out. I thinkDee Dee is right. I don't think that it will out in the hard linesthat it is outlined. I'm sure that he will portray it that way. I think that it will not be that way, and I think that, at theend of the day, it will come down to what George Will just said. Americans will say, does government -- is the government's role toprotect us or to protect us against government? And I think moreAmericans have seen those that have had this rhetoric of protect usagainst government hasn't worked. STEPHANOPOULOS: That will have to be the last word. You guyshave a lot more to say. Say it in the green room."	1.0

It’s all so clear now,” he added.After the video started to go viral in ISIS cave networks and strongholds, thousands of terrorists began pouring out into the streets of Mayadin, giving one another spontaneous group hugs, destroying their weapons, and planting trees and flowers in an attempt to begin rebuilding the Middle East into a utopian wonderland.According to reports, al-Baghdadi further confirmed that a recent advertisement in which Kendall Jenner offered a group of riot police a Pepsi was also influential in his decision to immediately cease their murderous reign of terror and lead ISIS down a path of peace.TAGS	1.0

One of the people at the center of the issue is Mark Kelly, retired astronaut and Navy captain, and the husband of former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot two years ago.Captain Kelly joins us from Tucson, Arizona.Captain, after Newtown, there was national outrage over these acts of mass violence, but that has begun to change. CBS has a new poll, just after the massacre, 57 percent supported stricter gun controls. Now, that's down to 47 percent.And, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says the bill he'll introduce the week after next won't include a ban on assault weapons and won't include a limit on high capacity magazines.Question -- should President Obama have moved faster to bring it to a vote before the call for action began to fade?CAPTAIN MARK KELLY, (RET.) U.S. NAVY: Well, I think, after something like, you know, 20 first graders being murdered in their classrooms, you know, it is important to take action. And the American people are demanding action now. You know, the timeline of that, you know, sometimes, especially with a polarized Congress, these things can take a long time.But, it's clear -- and you say that, you know, there is less support and I want to address that for a second. When you use words like gun control, you know, gun control doesn't poll very well, but we do know that over 90 percent of Americans support a universal background check. And, there is incredible momentum in Congress and around the nation to get this done.WALLACE: Well, you say incredible momentum. Five Republican senators say that they are going to filibuster any additional gun restrictions. We have them up on the screen.What do you say, for instance, to Marco Rubio and Rand Paul?KELLY: Well, first, I would say to Marco Rubio that 94 percent of his constituents support a universal background check.For Senator Rand Paul, it's about 83 percent, in Kentucky. So, they should listen to their constituents and, certainly, shouldn't be getting in the way of the process, which is to debate the bill and to vote on the bill. I mean, that doesn't make any sense.And, I imagine that at some point, if they actually do this, that their constituents will hold them accountable for those actions.WALLACE: Why do you think there is, in polls -- I mean, there are a couple of things going on here. One, we see in the polls, diminishing support. Two, we see Harry Reid, who is, you know, the Senate majority leader, and he's not even going to include the high capacity magazines or the assault weapons ban in the bill. They'll be a vote of amendments, but they're not part of the bill. He says in the assault weapons ban, it wouldn't get 40 votes, let alone 60.What's going on?KELLY: Well, certainly, you know, in this country we have a very powerful gun lobby and the leadership of the NRA has done a very good job over many, many years of controlling the debate on this issue. But, one thing that is different now, is the fact that we had 20 first graders murdered in a classroom, along with six educators. I mean, that's unacceptable.And the American people, you know, want something done on this. You know, 92 percent of Americans support a universal background check. It's 74 percent of NRA members.I would hope at some point that the leadership of the NRA would just listen to their membership on this issue.WALLACE: We're going to get to the background check in a second. One last question about the Senate, because Republicans say they are going to offer an alternative bill that would crack down on gun trafficking and would beef up school safety. It would not include the background check or an assault weapons ban.What do you think of what's called the ""Grassley alternative""?KELLY: Well, you know, I think it is a mistake. Any bill that does not include a universal background check is a mistake. It's the most common-sense thing that we can do to prevent criminals and the mentally ill from having access to weapons.I mean, the system we have right now, we have 40 percent of all Americans who buy a gun, buy it without a background check and that's probably where most of the criminals and the mentally ill are going. I mean, we know from a poll that has been done with criminals in prison, that over 80 percent of them get them through that loophole.So, it would be a mistake not to address the thing that 92 percent of American households support and 74 percent of NRA members support, which is the universal background check.WALLACE: All right. Well, let's pick up on that, because the main feature of what is going to be in the Senate bill and what you are pushing and pushing today is the universal background check. This week, you went -- or rather, recently, a few weeks ago, you went to a gun store in the Arizona area, and bought a .45 caliber hand gun and afterwards discussed the background check you had to go through with your wife, Gabby.Let's take a look.KELLY: It was very easy to do. It took just like five minutes.FORMER REP. GABBY GIFFORDS, D-ARIZ.: Yes. Five minutes.KELLY: You know, that's all we have to do to make sure everybody has to get a background check before buying a gun, to make sure that criminals and the mentally ill can't get one.GIFFORDS: Universal background check.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Captain Kelly, what do you think that showed?KELLY: Well, you know, we went in there, my executive director (inaudible), the executive of our organization, and in five minutes and 36 seconds is the time it took to fill out one piece of paper. You only have to fill out one side for it to be submitted to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and get an answer. Five minutes and 36 seconds.So, what it shows you is that it is not the burden that the NRA leadership says, what a background check is. I mean, it's s a simple, common sense thing we can do to make sure criminals and the mentally ill can't have access to firearms.WALLACE: Well, let's talk about that, because, in Gabby's tragic case, the shooter, Jared Loughner, had been suspended from college, because he was deemed to be a threat to himself and to others. He went to a gun store, he got a gun, passed a background check. And, yet was able to go out and shoot Gabby and 18 other people.And, the NRA says the problem with the background check is that -- the kind of mental health information, for instance in Loughner's case, doesn't get passed on. So, it doesn't get to be part of the background check.KELLY: Well, it doesn't get passed on in a lot of cases. You know, you know, 19 states have included less than 100 records on mental illness into the NICS, into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. In the case of the shooter in Tucson, the information on his mental illness, that caused him to get expelled from community college, that should have been in the system. His admitted drug use to the U.S. Army, who rejected him, that should have been in the system.So he should have -- if we had, you know, a system -- if we improved the system, he would have been rejected from buying the gun in the gun store. Now, the other problem is, there's the other loophole, right? There's the records loophole, but there is the loophole that would allow him to go to a gun show, or on the Internet to buy a gun.And we need to prevent criminals and the mentally ill from doing that. It's crazy that we have a system -- you know, we have a system that responsible gun owners get a background check, and the option to avoid one is available for anybody who doesn't want to do it. I mean, it's a -- it's a crazy system.WALLACE: But doesn't the NRA have a point: if you're going to expand the background check and cover more people, don't you have to make sure the mental health information gets into the system, because otherwise it's kind of a waste of time?KELLY: They absolutely have a point. I mean, they are -- they are right on that issue.I mean, we need to encourage states to include the mental health records. After Virginia Tech, for instance, Virginia was one of the worst states on this. And after what happened in Virginia Tech, they're actually really, really good about getting those records to the federal government.So I'm encouraging -- I mean, I would love to be able to work with the leadership of the NRA and work with the United States Senate and the House to make sure we get those records in the system and then close the gun show and private seller loophole, like 92 percent of Americans want, like 74 percent of NRA members want.WALLACE: The big hold-up in the Senate now over the background check is that if you do expand it to include gun shows and private sales, do the people who sell the guns in those cases have to keep private records? Keep records of those sales? And as you well know, the NRA says the danger is that if they have to do what licensed dealers have to do and keep those records, that could be used to form a national registry and somewhere down the line, that could be used to confiscate people's guns.How do you respond to that?KELLY: Well, I just don't think it's logical. I mean, right now, when you buy a gun in a gun store like I did, you know, there is a record that remains with the gun store. It's not a record with the federal government. It is not a record that is going to one day lead to a national registry, or gun confiscation.So the system currently works with the federally licensed firearms dealers. There is no reason that same system cannot work with the gun show, and the private seller. But, of course, this is an issue for many, you know, some Republican senators. And it's certainly something that could be worked on. I mean, we've got a lot of smart members in the Senate and I think they can figure out a compromise on this issue.WALLACE: Finally, Arizona officials this week released a lot of records about the shooter, Jared Loughner, the man who shot Gabby and 18 others. His parents, it turns out, knew he was deeply disturbed. They tested him for drugs, but they did not send him to get help.What do you have to say after learning all of this to Jared Loughner's parents?KELLY: Well, certainly as a parent, myself, I understand. I mean, it is a tragic thing they went through as well. It would have been an entirely different situation, however, if he would have gotten some mental health -- you know, gotten an evaluation. And when he -- you know, certainly in his case, when he's taking medication, he's not as psychotic as without the medication.So, this would have clearly been -- would not have happened if he would have had proper mental health treatment, you know? But you can't -- you know, you can't go back in time. I mean, there's -- you know, the only thing we can do is move forward and try to make sure that the dangerously mentally ill are not only getting treatment for their mental illness, but let's make sure they don't have access to guns. Let's make sure criminals don't have access to guns.I mean, our organization, Americans for Responsible Solutions -- I mean, we are really focused on this, every, single day. To make sure we fix this problem, and we address gun violence in this country.WALLACE: I just want to pick up on that last point, because after Newtown, there was a lot of talk about making it easier for authorities, a school or a family to commit a Jared Loughner, an Adam Lanza, the Newtown shooter before they got access to guns and acted out in this horrible way. But, that seems to have been forgotten in all of the debate about gun control.KELLY: Well, I don't know if it has been forgotten. I mean, certainly, you know, the debate in the Senate is going to -- going to include some aspect of help for the mentally ill. Now, what that is, you know, I'm not -- you know, I don't know what those details -- how that's going to turn out but that is certainly an important component of this. I mean, to address mental illness in this country, to get those records of mental illness into the system and then to make sure that there isn't a loophole where the clearly dangerously and mentally ill and criminals can get access to a gun.WALLACE: Captain Kelly, we want to thank you. Thank you for joining us. And we want to wish you and your wife, Gabby, the very best, sir.KELLY: Thank you, and, happy Easter, Chris.WALLACE: Happy Easter to you.Up next on this Easter Sunday, we'll discuss the new pope and the challenges he faces as we talk with one of the men who elected him, Washington's cardinal, Donald Wuerl.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: Today at the Vatican, Pope Francis celebrated his first Easter mass as leader of the world's 1 billion Catholics. In the traditional Easter message, the pope called for a political solution to the civil war in Syria, as well as peace on the Korean peninsula.As his papacy begins, Francis has set a humble tone in contrast to the corruption and scandal in some parts of the church. But, how much does the new pope intend to shake things up?Earlier, I asked the archbishop of Washington, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, what he thinks Pope Francis will do.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: Your Eminence, happy Easter and welcome back to ""Fox News Sunday.""CARDINAL DONALD WUERL, ARCHBISHOP OF WASHINGTON: Thank you. It's great to be back.WALLACE: From the moment he took the world stage, Pope Francis talked about serving the poorest, the weakest, the least important. On Holy Thursday, he followed the tradition of washing the feet of 12 people. But instead of 12 priests as other popes have done, he washed and kissed the feet of a dozen young inmates, including women and Muslims.Question -- what message is the pope sending about what he is going to do?WUERL: I think his message is a very clear one, that you bear witness with words, but you also bear witness with actions. And I think what he is trying to say to all of us is, if we really are trying to introduce people to the gospel, if we are really trying to tell believers how important the gospel is, can't you do that as well, maybe even better, with actions as well as words. I think that's what he's trying to do.WALLACE: There is a widespread sense that the church has problems, governance problems. That there is corruption inside the church, that there are turf wars. One of the first things the pope has to deal with is that secret investigative report about the Vatican leaks.Why did the cardinals believe that Pope Francis was the right man to clean things up?WUERL: I think there are probably a couple of ideas that were going around as we were talking about who might be the next pope, who would be the best person to choose. One, when we talk about the church, we also want to make sure that we distinguish it from just the operation of the Vatican. I think we were concerned about who will keep the momentum of the new evangelization going and who will keep this energy the church is seeing among many of our young people around the world. Who will keep that going?At the same time, somebody has to address the administration of the Holy See. Somebody has to take a look at what is working and what isn't working. I can't tell you what that means, because we didn't have the report. But the very fact that we recognize there needs to be some change, that was a part of the thinking.Can you -- can you envision someone better than Pope Francis? The credibility he brings to whatever he decides, in the Vatican, is going to be enormous. But, in the meantime, he is keeping the focus on the rest of the church, where there is an awful lot of good going on.WALLACE: But on the inside game, how aggressive a reformer, how revolutionary, if you will, do you expect Pope Francis to be -- not on doctrine -- but on changing the way the church does business?WUERL: Well, perhaps we're seeing signs of it in the fact that he hasn't moved in to the papal residence, that he's chosen to stay in the residence where we all were for the conclave. Maybe he's simply saying, there are going to be a lot of changes, we're going to get back to something that will be a little more direct, and maybe contact with the pope will be a little easier.And that was one of the things that we cardinals talked about -- the need to find ways in which there is a lot more communication between the rest of the church and the pope.WALLACE: All right. You were there. We saw all of the pictures. Take us inside. This is your first conclave. Take us inside the Sistine Chapel. They closed the doors, the 115 cardinal electors are all there and you are choosing the head of church, for 1.2 billion, 1.3 billion Catholics.What is that moment like?WUERL: There is a solemnness that I really wasn't prepared to experience as fully. When you hear that door closing, you hear it, and the -- that bolt is locked, then you realize, this is really a liturgy. We're all -- we're all wearing what we would wear if we were presiding at a mass, somewhere. Not as the celebrant but simply as a cardinal.This absolute silence -- and the one thing you are supposed to be doing is listening with your heart. Before I went in, I talked to one of the older cardinals, he's 90 years old. He came to one of those general meetings, just so we could chat. I have known him for 40 years.And I said to him, ""Cardinal, I am feeling a little bit overwhelmed by all of this."" He said, ""When you get into the Sistine Chapel and they close that door, just listen with your heart. And you'll hear.""And it turned out to be true. There is a solemn oath you take, and, then, Chris, when the moment comes to write a name on the ballot. There is nobody there but you and, I like to think, the Holy Spirit, guiding that pen.WALLACE: I'm fascinated. There were five ballots. Obviously, the fifth ballot you chose the pope. After a ballot, and they tell you, so-and-so, Bergoglio, Pope Francis has so many votes. Do you mill about and talk and --WUERL: No. This is the interesting thing. They count the ballots and that in itself is rather solemn. Three people look at each ballot, and go through the whole thing, so -- once it's clear no one was elected, nothing is said.There is this moment, quiet, and then, you just write another name on the next ballot. It is as if the Holy Spirit is saying, look, now you know the direction, OK. You're going to have to -- you're going to have to whittle this down.This is the power of the part, though, Chris, you have your ballot in your hand and you have to stand there in front of that fresco of the last judgment, and say, ""I call on Christ the Lord, who will come to judge me that this ballot is for the person I believe should serve and lead the church."" And it's really powerful.But, there is no milling about. There is no discussion. There -- it's altogether different than anything that you and I have experienced in our life here, politically. There are no nominations, no candidates. It's all open to the action of the spirit.WALLACE: Not exactly like pulling the lever on election day.The big story in Washington, this week, as you well know has been the Supreme Court's consideration of the issue of same sex marriage. If the court finds that there is a constitutional right, what will you say to gays, who are good Catholics, attend church every week, who say, who believe that God made them that way, and who want to commit to a partner?WUERL: We are always welcoming of everyone. The Catholic Church welcomes everyone.But, the Catholic Church also reminds all of us, there is a moral law. There are commandments of God, and we have to do our best to live by them. We announce that from the pulpit and, we try to meet people where they are and walk with them in life's journey.The church is probably, with 20 centuries of experience, probably the most understanding of the human condition of any institution. But, at the same time it does remind, not only gay people, but heterosexual people, straight people, you're not supposed to be following a moral law apart from what Christ has said to us.We do that all the time --WALLACE: So, specifically, what do you say, what would you say to the good, gay Catholic?WUERL: I think we try to work with them, whatever situation they find themselves in. The goal is to hold them as close to the church and to Christ and the sacraments as possible. A lot depends on how well we're able to communicate, how well we're able in a pastoral situation to look at each person's life and see where we are.WALLACE: So, you would allow him to continue in the church but you would not recognize his marriage?WUERL: We do that with people who are married, divorced and remarried. We say you are still part of the family, but we can't recognize that second marriage. We do that, we've done that -- and it has never been a great problem.It's painful for all of us to have to realize that making our way through life is difficult and, that we can't always be as perfect as away would like to be. I look to the church to say to me, look, walk as close to Christ as you can. That's why we are here. Come to mass. Participate in the life of the church.WALLACE: I want to ask you about the legal situation. Canada legalized same sex marriage in 2005 and there have been legal problems. There was a case of a Knights of Columbus hall that had agreed to hold a reception for a married couple, until they found out that it was a same sex couple and they had to pay a fine.And there are questions, about a Catholic university that has housing for married couples, what are they going to do if it's a same sex couple. How is the church and the -- writ large, not just the church but the whole religious institution, how is it going to deal with that and doesn't it get a little bit to the issue you have with the administration, about the mandate of insurance policies, including birth control?WUERL: Shouldn't there be enough space in a society as pluralistic and free as America is to be able to work all of these things out in a way that everybody can be who they are, and carry on their activities?I'm thinking for example when we talk about changing the definition of marriage. There is going to have to be a lot of adjusting, because the whole world has always understood marriage is the word you use to describe when a man and a woman commit to each other for the rest of their lives, and generate and educate children. Once you change that arbitrarily, there is going to be downstream from that, all kinds of questions. We're going to have to deal with them one by one as we come to them and that's why the church keeps saying, make room for everyone's faith.The only thing I worry about is someone saying to see, you, because you believe that sex is intended for marriage, and because you believe that marriage is undissolvable and because you believe that marriage is between a man and a woman, that somehow you don't belong here, that somehow this is -- this is bigotry or this is hate speech. That's what I worry about.There has to be room enough in the society as large, as free and as pluralistic as America, to make space for all of us.WALLACE: Finally, for all of the controversies, this is Easter which has a very joyous meaning. What is your message, your Easter message, for our viewers.WUERL: The Easter message for every Christian is Christ is risen and that's we say, hallelujah, come to mass. But for the rest of the world, Easter is also a reminder of hope. There is always hope, individually, collectively, societally, we should never give up hope that we can make things better. That's the story of Easter.For the believer, it's hallelujah. For everyone else, it should be -- there is hope, there is a possibility to make it a better world.WALLACE: And it's a beautiful spring and flowers are blooming, and all is right with the world.Cardinal, Thank you so much.WUERL: You are very welcome. Thank you, Chris.(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: The archbishop of Washington, Cardinal Donald Wuerl.Up next, a threat to peace in the Pacific. We'll ask our Sunday group how serious is North Korea's drumbeat of war?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHUCK HAGEL, DEFENSE SECRETARY: ... their very provocative actions. And belligerent tone. It has ratcheted up the danger.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel responding to North Korea's threat of war against the U.S. and South Korea. And, it is time now for our Sunday group. Bill Kristol of ""The Weekly Standard."" Mara Liasson of National Public Radio. Republican strategist Ed Gillespie and Charles Lane of ""The Washington Post."" Well, Kim Jong- un, the young leader of North Korea, was quoted Friday as ordering his missile units to be ready to strike the U.S. and South Korea, and this photo was released. Kim meeting with top North Korean generals with a chart showing the trajectory of their missiles, hitting major American cities. Bill, what is Kim's game?BILL KRISTOL, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Who knows, but it's not good. I mean, they've murdered, starved millions of their own people, that regime, and now -- and they proliferated nuclear weapons. And don't forget, the Israeli strike on the Syrian nuclear weapons plant in 2007, that was given to them by North Korea. So, even if you discount North Korea, oh, they are containable, they are not going to destroy their regime by attacking us, they can proliferate weapons of mass destruction, they can proliferate nuclear weapons and missiles and guess what? Iran and North Korea have this dark relationship and North Korea is short of cash, it could sell these weapons to terrorist groups. So, the threat of North Korea is very real.WALLACE: And why do you think they are ratcheting up - he is ratcheting up the tension?KRISTOL: Well, the normal explanation is that it helps stabilize and, you know, helps secure his situation at home -- maybe that is true. But the degree to which, you know, they've created -- he might think he's being playing two games, like his father and his grandfather did, I guess, and, you know, they can pull back at the key moment. But, you know, South Korea and Japan are sitting there, nervous -- he killed South Koreans just about two years ago, three years ago, they killed, what, 45 South Korean sailors, attacked their ship. I mean, Japan, they lobbed a missile over Japan. It's dangerous.WALLACE: Yeah, let me pick up on that, Mara. Because the North Koreans traditionally, as Bill points out like to bluster and saber- rattle, but even by their standards, this is pretty extreme what is going on now, and that is the concern, that somehow particularly with South Korean, if you've ever been in Seoul, I mean it is an hour's drive from the DMZ. I mean they would be right on the front line. The danger is it gets out of hand.MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: The danger is it gets out of hand. And that crazy map behind Kim Jong-un, which showed the lines of the missiles hitting the mainland of the United States and exposing their, quote, battle plans, that might be a fantasy, but they can do tremendous damage to South Korea, and he's announced also that the armistice doesn't hold anymore. They are back in a state of war. Nobody knows exactly what he wants to do. I don't even know if he knows what he wants to do, but yes, it is a really dangerous situation, and I don't think the United States has a clear idea of what to do to stop him.WALLACE: Well, let's talk, Ed, about the U.S. response. Because first, Chuck Hagel, the defense secretary announced that we are beefing up our missile defense along the border with Alaska and then this week -- in Alaska, again, along the border with Russia, and, then, this week we sent, as you can see there -- a pair of B-2 stealth bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons, all the way from Missouri to military exercises over South Korea. Ed, sensible reaction by the Pentagon or over-reaction?ED GILLESPIE, FMR. ROMNEY CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER: No, I think it's a sensible reaction. And I think in addition to that, it would be good for the administration to not only bolster our own missile defense, but to support Japan and South Korea with missile defense. I think, to Bill's point, they are nervous, understandably, and I think doing anything -- everything we can to reassure them would be helpful, and, obviously, you know, trying to get China to engage in their own region in a way that would be helpful, I think, with Kim Jong-un would be important, too.WALLACE: I'm going to pick up on China in a second. Your thoughts, though, Chuck about the U.S. response. What we have done so far, what more we can do?CHARLES LANE, THE WASHINGTON POST: Well, I think President Obama's approach to North Korea throughout his presidency has been, essentially, not to rise to the bait, and I think that has been a good approach so far. I think sending the B-2s sent a strong signal.I think what we are dealing with here is sort of the third generation of a family business over there in North Korea, and the business is building up this whole military structure, building up as Bill suggests, the capability to proliferate. Conducting terrorist activities. People forget that years ago they blew up a whole group of South Korean diplomats in Burma of all places. And the purpose of the family business is through the constant threat, constant belligerence, constant menace, to extract money, concessions, and everything else you can get by blackmailing the other side. Whether the endgame of the family business is to actually go to war in South Korea, I doubt, because I think people are -- need to remember, North Korea would not win that war. At the very least would come out of it very badly damaged. So, I think what we are seeing here is a generation of war hysteria to help control themselves inside and the generation of threats, especially towards this new, more conservative, less concession-minded government in South Korea to see what they can extract. As they have now for 20 years since this nuclear issue began.WALLACE: You know, one of the concerns here, and that does seem to be different, Bill, is that North Korea seems to be ignoring the warnings from its main, far and away biggest sponsor, China, which had warned the regime and Kim Jong-un not to make these threats against the United States, not to make these threats against South Korea, and yet it proceeded with them. Why would Kim risk alienating the country that literally, you know -- talk about biting the hand that feeds you, that literally feeds its people?KRISTOL: Well, China never seemed to really have been willing to pull the trigger and stop feeding his people or stop providing other kinds of aid to North Korea, so they've gotten away with this in the past, and the Chinese have been unwilling to risk undermining -- allowing the North Korean regime to be undermined and to fall with the unified Korea. And I think that's dangerous to them. I don't know why, Korea isn't going to invade China, but nonetheless, they want to preserve -- they don't want the East European model of communist regimes falling on their border.The U.S., what can we do? We can get serious about missile defense. We spend about 1.5 percent of our defense budget on missile defense. The Obama administration having canceled the ground base interceptors, then restored them just, what, a couple of weeks ago, and said we're going ahead on it. But basically, under both parties, really, but especially under the Democrats, there's been a sort of very haphazard (inaudible) through to President Reagan's announcement 30 years ago. The (inaudible) made a decision, really, and maybe we should try to defend ourselves from nuclear weapons and not just accept them as inevitable. And I think in a post-Cold War world, we don't know, the North Korean regime could be ten or 20 years from now, and they could have many more missiles and many more nuclear weapons and they could be proliferating them. I'm not sure we'll find them or the Israelis will know whether they have proliferated. Don't we want to get serious and spend some real money and really invest in serious missile defense for ourselves and our neighbors?(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Ed, the president has kind of flipped on missile defense.GILLESPIE: Yeah.WALLACE: Because when he first came in, he pulled back on some of the deployment of anti-missile interceptors. Now, one of his first steps, he and Chuck Hagel at the Pentagon, was to beef up our interceptors system up along the Alaska coast.GILLESPIE: Yeah, and like I said, they should be commended for that. I'll take one exception, Bill, I'm not -- I think President Bush did make a priority of missile defense, and one of the first things that the Obama administration did was to reverse that, and now they've reversed themselves again, understanding that there was a reason for it, an important strategic reason for it, and I'm glad they reversed themselves. I wish they hadn't reversed themselves in the first place or reverse the policy in the first place, but we have -- this is an example of why we need missile defense, and we need for our friends to have it as well.WALLACE: All right. We have to take a break here, but when we come back, after this week's historic Supreme Court hearings on same sex marriage, where does the issue stand now?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SUPREME COURT JUSTICE SAMUEL ALITO: You want us to step in and render a decision based on an assessment of the effects of this institution, which is newer than cell phones or the Internet? I mean we -- we are not -- we do not have the ability to see the future.SUPREME COURT JUSTICE ELENA KAGAN: Supposed the states said, because we think that the focus of marriage really should be on procreation we are not going to give marriage licenses anymore to any couple where both people are over the age of 55. Would that be constitutional?(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Supreme Court Justices Samuel Alito and Elena Kagan differing on whether the court should intervene in the issue of same sex marriage. We're back now with the panel. So, at the end of a rare two days of arguments, Bill, where do you think the court is on the constitutional question of same sex marriage, and also, on the Defense of Marriage Act, which denies federal benefits to same sex couples, who have been legally married in their states?KRISTOL: I mean, it looks as if the court will strike down part of the Defense of Marriage Act, on sort of federalism grounds, and ...WALLACE: But it's a state issue, not a federal issue.KRISTOL: Right, and the federal government in a way is putting a thumb on the scale by preferring traditional marriage to states that -- by preferring states that have chosen traditional marriage over states that have chosen same sex marriage, and it looks as if the court is not going to impose a universal constitutional right to same sex marriage on the nation. And I hope they don't, and I -- I think they won't.WALLACE: Do you think that they will leave Prop 8 alone and, just, let's say, deny it on procedural grounds, the plaintiff didn't have standing or do you think that they might decide, yes, Prop 8 either stands or falls in California, but that doesn't impact other states.KRISTOL: Yeah, I can't - I can't tell it, it is hard to read. And maybe others know better than I do what the court is going to do.WALLACE: All right, we'll go down the list. Down the row here and see. But, one of the points, Mara, that several justices made, is that public opinion is changing so quickly on this issue, both in the polls and, four states in 2012 legalized same sex marriage, that perhaps the court should stay out of it, and leave it to the political process in the states. In that sense, could the supporters of same sex marriage be victims of their own success?LIASSON: Yes. I think they could and I actually think the best outcome for Democrats and even proponents of same sex marriage is if Prop 8 is upheld in California, but there is no sweeping constitutional finding that same sex marriage is legal all over the country, because ...WALLACE: Well, if Prop 8 is upheld, that means that same sex marriage is banned.LIASSON: No, I'm sorry, Prop 8 is -- the lower court ruling is upheld, which means Prop 8 is overturned.WALLACE: OK.LIASSON: I'm sorry about that. But if they want to in California, right now they could back and put up Prop 8.2, legalizing same sex marriage and it would probably pass, it is a lot more meaningful and profound to kind of adjudicate divisive social issues by voters and legislators, not unelected justices, and I think that it's going to be more lasting political change if you do it at the ballot box. It also means you're not going to have this huge backlash and I agree with Bill, I don't think the court is going in the direction of legalizing same sex marriage on the national constitutional basis.WALLACE: Ed, let's talk about the politics of this. You, of course, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, isn't this a problem for the GOP? As we say, public opinion is moving in the direction of support for same sex marriage, especially among young people, 70, 80 percent of all people of all persuasions, under the age of 35, 40, support same sex marriage as a legal right. But the polls show that Republicans still overwhelmingly oppose it, only 27 percent in one poll, I saw, support same sex marriage. So, where does the Republican Party go? You have an awful lot of your base still very much opposes this. But you can see the pendulum swinging for the country.GILLESPIE: Chris, I don't see the Republican Party or most Republicans, obviously, changing in terms of believing that marriage is between one man and one woman. I do think that in the context of this debate, as in so many other debates, Republicans have been cast in the negative, you know - in the negative to say we are opposing something as opposed to talking about what most Republicans are for. Most Republicans are also for the benefits of marriage in the legal system, that are afforded, the protections like, for example, visitation - hospital visitation rights or survivorship benefits and I think you will hear more Republicans making that point, that we can do those things without having the government sanction same sex marriage.WALLACE: But looking at the polls, and, particularly, looking at where younger people are going, would you have any problems in 2016, with a Republican Party platform saying that marriage is between a man and a woman?GILLESPIE: I wouldn't have any problem with that. I think one of the questions is, I believe the platform right now calls for a federal constitutional amendment to ban it. You know, there may be a debate about that.WALLACE: (inaudible) ban same sex marriage.GILLESPIE: Yeah, to ban it. I don't think you would ever see the Republican Party platform saying we are in favor of same sex marriage, but there may be a question, because I think to Mara's point, the federalism aspect of this Supreme Court debate has been interesting, and because a lot of conservatives have felt for a long time that Roe was wrongfully decided and imposed ...WALLACE: Roe v. Wade.GILLESPIE: Roe v. Wade.WALLACE: 1973.GILLESPIE: And that the issue of abortion should have been left to the states, for people to hash out in a more civil manner.A lot of conservatives found themselves arguing in this instance that the court shouldn't impose a federal mandate that it is legal. So there has been a little bit of a shift I think in terms of Republicans saying we should allow this to be worked out in the states not imposed by courts and not imposed federally. And, it will be interesting to see how that shakes up, because the platform as it is today says a federal constitutional amendment to ban it.WALLACE: We should point out it isn't just conservatives who feel that Roe was wrong in this particular issue, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a justice of the Supreme Court appointed by Democrats, liberal, very much an abortion rights supporter, says she thinks it was a mistake, because she thought it moved the court too quickly in this direction in a judicial fiat instead of leaving it to the states to work out something that they were working out. Chuck, when you listened to what you three learned colleagues, your fellow justices here on the court, say, your thoughts about the debate this week, where it leaves the issue and the political implications.LANE: Well, as to the debate, not to sounds Pollyanish, but I thought it was actually refreshing and useful for the whole country to listen to two days of discussion among nine very intelligent people of various views who are not running for office, you know? And who aren't obsessed with the short-term political consequences of these things themselves, but are really sort of wrestling with it in a very serious way, and in that regard I think it was a very, very helpful occasion in the whole debate. Because they've had the sort of guts to go through a whole lot of difficult questions, you know, about, is this really just like interracial marriage? What are the social science consequences and so forth.But I think what is crystallizing as a result of this is a distinction is developing between the substance of whether this is a good idea or not, and the process of how we as a country are going to decide. And, in that respect, I do think there is a -- a kind of a tentative consensus on the court that the procedural - the optimum way to handle it is to let the states decide, to give more time to the democratic process to work this thing out as opposed to having the judicial branch sort of slice through the Gordian knot --WALLACE: But what about the argument? For the sake of argument, what about the argument, look, we don't decide constitutional rights ...LANE: Right.WALLACE: ... that way. We don't decide whether schools can be segregated that way. We don't decide interracial marriage that way.LANE: I think the answer, I've heard from the court was, we're not ready to say this is a constitutional right. That there isn't enough support in the text of the document or in the precedence of this court to say that without same sex marriage every state in the union is violating the Constitution.WALLACE: Thank you, panel. See you next week and don't forget to check out panel-plus. Where our group picks right up with the discussion on our Web site, FoxNewsSunday.com, we'll post the video before noon eastern time, and make sure to follow us on Twitter @FoxnewsSunday.Up next, our Power Player of the Week.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: Of course, this is Easter Sunday. But, it was also 32 years ago, this weekend, a gunman tried to kill Ronald Reagan. Today, a story you have never heard before. About how a doctor saved the president's life with what he believes was some divine help. Here's our Power Player of the Week.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. SAM SPAGNOLO, GWU & VA MEDICAL CENTER: And they said we need you to come over to the hospital right away.WALLACE: That was how Dr. Sam Spagnolo learned 32 years ago he was about to take on the case of his life. He was the head of the lung department at George Washington University Hospital. And Ronald Reagan, who had sustained a gunshot to the lung, was in the operating room. SPAGNOLO: The bullet went through here and lodged over here on the inner surface of the lung, so another inch or two and it would have been into the heart.WALLACE: Spagnolo first saw the president when he was wheeled into the recovery room.SPAGNOLO: And we put him on the ventilator right away and he was getting some sedation and I stayed there until we finally got him off the ventilator, about 3 o'clock in the morning.WALLACE: The doctor says Reagan did well in the first couple of days, his condition serious, but not critical, then things changed. Spagnolo kept a diary he's making public for the first time.SPAGNOLO: Day five, April 3rd, 1981. I was called at home and requested a return to the hospital. I arrived at the presidential suite and asked the nurse in charge what was going on. She told me the president's temperature was almost 104 degrees and he was not looking well. That made all of us a little nervous about which way this was going to go.WALLACE (on camera): When you said which way this was going to go, was his life is danger?SPAGNOLO: At that point I thought his life was in danger.WALLACE: That's got to take your breath away.SPAGNOLO: It did.WALLACE (voice over): Spagnolo ordered a battery of tests, to check for infection. But the president's medical team resisted.SPAGNOLO: Things were going a little slower than I'd hoped.WALLACE (on camera): So, what did you say?SPAGNOLO: If we don't get movement, I'm not - I'm going to walk off this case.WALLACE (voice over): The other doctors agreed to the tests, but they found no sign of infection. Still, Spagnolo was convinced that was the problem. And put Reagan on antibiotics. Within 24 hours, his temperature went down.WALLACE (on camera): Honestly, 30 years later, what do you think would have happened if you had not intervened and given him this broad dose of antibiotics.SPAGNOLO: He might not have gotten better.WALLACE (voice over): Spagnolo sat by the president's bedside in the morning for the next two weeks, watching TV and listening to his stories. There was no mention of politics.SPAGNOLO: Day nine, Tuesday, April 7th -- I went to the president's room and spoke with him for 10 to 15 minutes. He looked better and his spirits were good. He continued to tell me various stories at that time about his early days in Hollywood.WALLACE: Months later the Reagans invited the medical team to the Oval Office to thank them for saving the president's life. Reagan always said his recovery was miraculous. Dr. Spagnolo agrees.SPAGNOLO: I certainly think somebody was watching over me, all the time, making sure that the thing was going well. I certainly - took any extra help that I could get from the good Lord above.(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: I spoke with Nancy Reagan this weekend and asked if she had a message for Dr. Spagnolo. She said please send him a big, big thank you.And that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next ""Fox News Sunday.""Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC.

http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2012/jan/04/declan-oscanlon/new-jersey-residents-earning-1-million-face-effect/	"	""Taxpayers earning $1 million pay an effective tax rate that is about four times what taxpayers earning $100,000 pay."""	true	['Taxes']	http://blog.nj.com/	http://blog.nj.com/njv_guest_blog/2011/12/what_are_fair_taxes_and_whats.html	2012/01/04	Mitsu Yasukawa/The Star-LedgerAssemblyman Declan J. O'Scanlon speaks during a meeting of the Assembly Budget Committee at the Statehouse Annex in Trenton in June of 2008.By Declan O’ScanlonIt’s a simple question loaded with political appeal: “With so many people hurting and income disparities rising, shouldn’t we ask New Jersey’s millionaires to pay a ‘fair share’ in taxes?”Okay, what’s a “fair” share? If the current share of state income tax paid by the top 1 percent of New Jersey’s taxpayers — about 37 percent — isn’t high enough, what is? Would 80 percent be fair? Or 90 percent? Taxpayers earning $1 million pay an effective tax rate that is about four times what taxpayers earning $100,000 pay. When and how will we know when we’ve achieved “fairness”?Unfortunately, intense partisanship — feeding on visceral emotions — has made it virtually impossible to have a rational conversation about taxes in America. As a senior member of the state Assembly’s Budget Committee, I think those of us in positions of leadership have a responsibility to do more than stoke emotions, and instead, adopt tax policies that generate the revenue needed to support budget priorities on a fair and sustainable basis.Piling taxes on the rich may be great politics, but it’s lousy public policy. New Jersey already has a progressive income tax system, which, thanks to high-income households receiving a greater proportion of their income from investments and capital gains, has made our revenue base highly volatile. Increasing our relative reliance on high-income taxpayers will increase volatility, making it more difficult to engage in prudent, long-term financial planning.Most experts believe increased volatility is a problem because fiscal stability is a condition precedent to sound policymaking. Wild fluctuations in revenues fuel an inefficient boom-and-bust approach to budget-making that mismanages expectations. The impact of emergent budget cuts on New Jersey residents is regressive — those at middle and lower income levels experience the pain of budget cuts disproportionately, since they more often benefit from state programs.Some editorialists have suggested Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s recent decision to embrace higher rates for high-income New Yorkers should serve as an example for New Jersey. New York’s current high rate is 8.97 percent, the same as New Jersey’s. Instead of letting the rate go down to 6.85 percent, as scheduled, Cuomo is saying he’ll let the rate fall to 8.82 percent for taxpayers at $2 million or more, but let the rate fall to 6.85 percent for taxpayers between $300,000 and $2 million. Everyone in New York will get a tax cut, but folks above $2 million will get less of a tax cut than they had expected. If that’s the standard of “fairness,” maybe the editorialists are right and we should follow New York’s example.Here’s the critical point: The top marginal rate in New York will soon fall below the top rate in New Jersey; that’s not good news for our competitive position.A review of national IRS data by Charles Steindel, the state Treasury’s chief economist, confirmed a statistical connection between tax increases enacted under former Gov. James E. McGreevey and an increase of affluent taxpayers who moved out of, or never moved into, New Jersey. Steindel also conducted a survey confirming a significant proportion of tax advisers had discussed the idea of moving out of New Jersey with their relatively affluent clients. The study and survey were modest in scope and merely confirmed what we already know: Yes, Virginia, taxes matter.Are they the only competitive consideration? Absolutely not. Infrastructure, regulations, climate, educational levels and other factors play a major role.Instead of asking “What’s fair?” we should be asking “What’s in our long-term self-interest?” I suggest it’s in New Jersey’s interest to pursue policies that support sustainable and growing revenue collections over time. Although New Jersey cannot expect to compete globally on the basis of low taxes alone, we should avoid negative “outlier” status and, with it, the kind of reputation that once prevented the Garden State from getting into the starting blocks when companies make site selections.Assemblyman Declan O’Scanlon (R-Monmouth) is the ranking Republican on the state’s Assembly Budget Committee.Most Read	1.0

Bernie Sanders responds here live.From ABC News, a special Super Tuesday addition of This Week. Here now, chief anchor George Stephanopoulos.(END VIDEO CLIP)GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC HOST: As we come on the air this week, it's getting harder and harder to find words to describe a presidential race that's sounding more and more like a grade school playground.Just two days from Super Tuesday, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are dominating this race. Clinton trounced Bernie Sanders in South Carolina Saturday by nearly 50 points, cruising into Super Tuesday's southern states on the strength of overwhelming support from African-American voters.And with Donald Trump ahead right now in nearly all the Super Tuesday states, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz have unleashed a barrage of new attacks, trying to slow the Trump steamroller.ABC's Jon Karl is here to start us off. Good morning, Jon.JON KARL, ABC NEWS CORRESPONDETN: Good morning, George.As he appears on the verge of winning it all, Donald Trump is facing his biggest test yet, a sustained assault of personal insults, substantive attacks and mockery that looks like it could have been designed by Trump himself.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)KARL: On the campaign trail Saturday, Donald Trump predicted a Super Tuesday rout.TRUMP: Hopefully we're going to win Tennessee, we're going to win everything. I think we're even -- I think we're even really have a great chance to win Texas.KARL: And after his double digit wins in South Carolina and Nevada, some establishment Republicans finally agree he could actually win this thing.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trump, he's got the momentum. I think there's more than a 50 percent chance he's the nominee.KARL: Nowhere was that hammered home more than with Friday's shocking endorsement.CHRISTIE: We need a first class president, and we're going to have it in Donald Trump.KARL: New Jersey's tough guy governor, Chris Christie, who once mocked Trump as the entertainer in chief is now in his corner.But with Trump on the verge of an insurmountable lead, Marco Rubio has decided desperate times call for desperate measures.RUBIO: Well, I don't know anything about bankrupting four times. You bankrupted four companies. I don't know anything about starting a university that was a fake university.KARL: Around the campaign, Rubio has insisted he wouldn't go after his fellow Republicans.RUBIO: And I know that there's this craving in the media for people to attack each other, but I've never been a campaign that attacks people.KARL: Now he's using Trump's playbook, mocking the frontrunner with personal insults.RUBIO: How can a person with the worst spray tan in America attack me on Twitter for wearing makeup.He said he wanted to sue me. He's going to sue me. He should sue whoever did that to his face.KARL: Besides the insult assault, Rubio has a new label for the billionaire businessman.RUBIO: He is a con artist.Con artist.I will never stop until we keep a con man from taking over the party of Reagan.KARL: Trump and his new wingman were happy to return fire.TRUMP: This lightweight Rubio, total lightweight. And little mouth on him -- bing, bing, bing. Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.CHRISTIE: When the heat was on Senator Rubio in those debates, you saw what happened. He melted. He melted.KARL: As the campaign turns into a food fight, the question is Rubio's aggressive strategy too little, too late?With so much at stake, Senator Lindsey Graham had a colorful diagnosis for the state of the Republican Party .SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: My party has gone bat (EXPLETIVE DELETED) crazy.(END VIDEOTAPE)STEPHANOPOULOS: And Jon Karl joins us now along with the rest of the roundtable.I want to start with Hugh Hewitt, Salem Radio Networks.You were in the middle of that debate on Thursday night as well. And we just heard Lindsey Graham, the Republican Party bat bleep crazy?HUGH HEWITT, CONSERVATIVE RADIO SHOW HOST: Yes, it was an interesting red wedding debate.I can't complain about the ferocity or the velocity, as Hyman Roth said in Godfather II, this is the business we have chosen. So I like covering things like that.But we are on the verge of a tipping point in the Republican Party where it could actually split for the first time. I've got a note this morning from Meg Whitman who is the finance co-chair for Chris Christie denouncing Chris Christie for political opportunism. And that's kind of a shattering thing when your finance co-chair takes a roundhouse at you.So, we are at the verge of a real meltdown in the Republican Party. It might happen Tuesday.STEPHANOPOULOS: Split in the Republican Party, Greta?GRETA VAN SUSTERN, FOX NEWS: I don't know about that.Look, you know the problem with this is it's entertaining, but it's not particularly inspirational by any of these candidates at this point.I mean we all probably shouldn't laugh and do laugh at the things that are said. You heard the audience laugh.But the Republican Party has got to come to terms with the fact that they're not inspiring, they're entertaining.STEPHANOPOULOS: And Jon Karl, trying to come to terms with Donald Trump, the real possibility he's the nominee.KARL: Absolutely. But I am told that there are at least two dozen House Republicans that have told their colleagues that they will not support Donald Trump as their nominee. So if he goes, if he solidifies this on Super Tuesday and goes on the win this nomination, he will be the leader of a very divided Republican Party, some who simply will not support him.VAN SUSTEREN: But the voters are supporting him. That's the -- you know, like all the candidates can say, or all the politicians can say we won't support him, but at least so far the voters have.STEPHANOPOULOS: Meantime on the Democratic side, Donna Brazile, that win for Hillary Clinton yesterday in South Carolina got a higher percentage of the African-American vote. Now there were three candidates eight years ago, but higher percentage than Barack Obama.DONNA BRAZILE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Everyone was surprised last night, not just by the margin, but the depth and the real excitement she had in South Carolina.Her southern firewall is intact. But as you well know, this is a race about delegates, not just winning states. And so the real question is, will she be able to replicate that in other southern states like Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi?STEPHANOPOULOS: And Katrina Vanden Heuvel, you are the editor and publisher of The Nation. You endorsed Bernie Sanders. Does he have a viable path going forward?KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL, THE NATION: Yes. I would say not so fast. Don't write Bernie Sanders's political obituary after South Carolina. There is a path ahead. 17 states vote in the next two weeks. Whatever happens, he has -- and I think he has a path -- he has injected new ideas into this campaign. He has transformed the Democratic Party. He has opened space for more progressive movements.But as Donna knows, it's way too early after South Carolina. I think he goes to the convention. This goes through May. He will have pledged delegates. And he will fight to shape the platform.STEPHANOPOULOS: And we will talk to him ahead. I want you all to stand by right now.But right now, we are going to turn to Senator Ted Cruz. He's in Arkansas this morning.Good morning, Senator.SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Good morning, George.CRUZ: Good to be with you.STEPHANOPOULOS: Thank you, Senator.Thanks for joining us this morning.New polls out this morning show you're looking pretty good in Texas, but Donald Trump is strong in so many other Super Tuesday states.If he wins everywhere else, how can you prevent him from getting the the nomination?CRUZ: Well, I think Super Tuesday is going to be the most important day of this entire primary. And -- and it is, right now we're in -- we're in a strong position in Texas and we're running neck and neck with Donald in states throughout Super Tuesday.And I think it really depends on turnout. If conservatives come out and vote on Super Tuesday, we're going to have a strong day.I also depends, George, you know, 65 percent of Republicans believe that -- that Donald Trump is not the best candidate to go head-to-head with Hillary Clinton, that Donald Trump loses to Hillary Clinton.And -- and the only candidate that has beaten Donald Trump, the only candidate that can beat Donald Trump is me. And so I think more and more Republicans who are recognizing Donald Trump is not the right person for us to nominate. If we come together and stand united on Super Tuesday, we're going to have a good election night.STEPHANOPOULOS: But, you know, you talk about that support from conservatives, but the fact is that in most of those states, Donald Trump is winning among conservatives, winning among your strong base of Evangelical Christians.CRUZ: Well, you know, I think the debate last week really started to show some significant differences. And -- and in particular, the difference you saw is -- is you saw Washington deal makers -- listen, it's Washington deal makers that have gotten us in this mess.And Donald promises yet more deals with Democrats. Remember, Donald is someone who has contributed financially to Jimmy Carter, to John Kerry, to Hillary Clinton, to Chuck Schumer.He is someone who had funded open border Democrats for 40 years and -- and, indeed, one of the striking things, you know, Donald talks a lot about immigration, but in the 2013 battle over amnesty, when I was leading the fight against the Rubio-Schumer Gang of Eight amnesty bill and we defeated it in Congress, Donald Trump was funding the Gang of Eight. Five of the eight members of the Gang of Eight received, collectively, over $50,000 from Donald Trump.And you can't be funding open border Democrats, like Donald Trump did, and, at the same time be claiming that you're actually going to secure the border and stop illegal immigration.STEPHANOPOULOS: You've been making that point about Donald Trump supporting Democrats for -- for several weeks right now. It doesn't seem to be sticking.Why not?CRUZ: Well, listen, I know we're seeing real movement in the polls. We won in Iowa and -- and I think on Super Tuesday, we're going to have a good night. You know, I've got to say, George, it was striking at the debate this week when Donald Trump disagreed with me. He disagreed with me, number one, on Israel. He said that America should be neutral between Israel and the Palestinians. I strongly disagree with him on that.If I am president, America will stand unapologetically with Israel.But he also disagreed with me on the Supreme Court and religious liberty. He said, Ted, you've got to be willing to cut deals, you've got to be willing to compromise.I'll tell you right now and I'll tell the people at home, I am not going to compromise on ""The Bill of Rights."" I'm not going to bargain away your religious liberty. I'm not going to bargain away your Second Amendment rights and sit down with Harry Reid or Chuck Schumer and agree on Supreme Court nominees. we need a president who will invest the political capital to defend your -- your constitutional liberties. And Donald Trump told us at the debate he doesn't intend to do that. There's a reason Harry Reid, when asked about the Republican field, said the Republican he likes the best is Donald Trump, and he said, because I can work with him. He'll cut deals.We've had too many deals in Washington. It's way we're bankrupting our kids and grandkids.STEPHANOPOULOS: You've made a big issue of Donald Trump's taxes, now released summaries of your own returns.If he releases those some kind of summaries, will that be enough?And -- and what do you think of his -- his statement that he believes he might be targeted by the IRS because he's a Christian.CRUZ: Well, I -- I think his statement, nobody who heard it had any reaction other than laughter. Listen, I've released now nine years of taxes. Donald Trump has not released any of his tax information. He needs to release his tax information.And -- and the fact that he's refusing to do so really suggests, as Mitt Romney pointed out, that there may be a bombshell in there, that there's something he's hiding.Now -- now, it could be an awful lot of media...STEPHANOPOULOS: What do you think it is?CRUZ: -- outlets have reported -- well, a lot of media outlets have reported that he doesn't make nearly as much money as he says he does.You know, who knows, maybe -- maybe the -- the fact is that Mitt Romney is richer than Donald Trump. We don't know. But -- but he's clearly hiding something.On the other hand, it could be donations to liberal groups like Planned Parenthood. At every debate, it seems, he praises Planned Parenthood. Maybe he's written them a bunch of checks. Or -- or, you know, maybe there are other issues. You know -- you know, for example, there have been multiple media reports about Donald's business dealings with the mob, with the Mafia. Now maybe his tax returns show that those business dealings are a lot more extensive than has been reported...STEPHANOPOULOS: Business dealings with the Mafia?CRUZ: We don't know -- indeed. ABC has reported that. You guys have reported that he's -- he's done deals with S&A Concrete, which was owned by two of the big crime families in New York, and that he's had involvement in Atlantic City. Maybe that's what his tax returns show.We don't know, but the important point is, George, in the general election, Hillary Clinton is going to shine a light on all of this. And Republican primary voters deserve to know. And the media is going to amplify the Democrats' attacks a thousand fold.The Republican primary voters deserve to know if there's a scandal, if there is, at Mitt Romney put it, a bombshell in Donald Trump's taxes, we deserve to know, the voters deserve to know and to vet the candidates.STEPHANOPOULOS: You know, elected officials are in -- Republicans are getting increasingly nervous and -- and some are even calling on you -- Representative Franks from Arkansas, from -- from Arizona, excuse me -- to join forces with Senator Rubio in a joint ticket.Here's what he had to say, ""Senator Rubio and Senator criticize can unite and win together or remain apart and each fail separately. For the sake of our country, the conservative cause and future generations, I adjure both Senator Clinton and Senator Rubio to unite.CRUZ: Well, listen, I agree with the sentiment that -- that to beat Donald Trump, we've got to come together. What Donald wants is -- is all of us who are -- who are convinced Donald is not the right nominee to be divided, to be splintered. And -- and looking at this race, only one candidate has beaten Donald Trump. Historically, in modern times, nobody has ever won the nomination who hasn't won one of the first three states -- Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina.Only two of us have done that, me and Donald.And if you look at Super Tuesday, we're the only campaign in a position to beat Donald on Super Tuesday.So if you're at home and -- and you don't think Donald is the right candidate, you think nominating Donald will end up electing Hillary Clinton, then even if, perhaps, you -- you look another candidate -- listen, there are a lot of good people in this race who I like and respect, but I would encourage you to stand with us, because the only way to beat Donald is for us to stand together on Super Tuesday.STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Cruz, it sounds like you're not ready to unite with Marco Rubio now, but thank you for joining us this morning.And we're live next with Chris Christie in a THIS WEEK exclusive.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), NEW JERSEY: I am proud to be here to endorse Donald Trump for President of the United States. He'll provide strong, unequivocal leadership. He will do what needs to be done to protect the American people first and foremost, both in the homeland and in creating jobs for this country. And he will make sure that people around the world know that America keeps its word again. Donald Trump is someone who, when he makes a promise, he keeps it.(END VIDEO CLIP)STEPHANOPOULOS: And Chris Christie is here this morning with us here on THIS WEEK.Thank you for joining us, Governor. And let's begin.You heard Hugh Hewitt at the top of the program read from that Meg Whitman statement. Your national finance co-chair says that your endorsement of Donald Trump, an astonishing display of political opportunism.She goes on to say Donald Trump is unfit to be president. He's a dishonest demagogue who plays to our worst fears. I call on Christie donors and supporters to reject the governor and Donald Trump outright. I believe they will. For some of us, principle and country still matter.CHRISTIE: Well, listen, I love Meg Whitman. She's a great friend to me and to Mary Pat, always has been. We obviously, from that statement, have a difference of political opinion. And that's OK. That's what makes this country great is that people can have differences of political opinion.And so Meg has always been free to express her views and I honor her. And we absolutely adore our relationship with her and I'm sure it'll continue.STEPHANOPOULOS: Some of your supporters say you promised them you would not endorse Donald Trump. Joe McQuaid (ph), the publisher of the ""New Hampshire Union Leader"" says you promised him on a phone call you wouldn’t endorse Donald Trump.CHRISTIE: Not, it's just not true. He called me two days after the primary and said, I was just hold that you're about to endorse Donald Trump. And I said to him, that's absolutely untrue. I'm not about to endorse anybody.But that's all the conversation --STEPHANOPOULOS: You didn't say you would never endorse him?CHRISTIE: No.STEPHANOPOULOS: OK, let's --(CROSSTALK)CHRISTIE: -- wasn't going to endorse him then; that's what he -- you know, New Hampshire person on the ground tell him that. And I said, Joe, it's two days after the primary. Mary Pat and I are just taking a deep breath. We haven't thought about what we're going to do next in this race.STEPHANOPOULOS: Let's talk about the policy in this campaign right now.During your campaign, you ran as a straight-talking truth-teller, specific answers to America's challenges. And here's what you tried -- you told voters to question Mr. Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRISTIE: I tell everybody who goes to a Donald Trump event, if he gets asked a question, just ask him how. First, he says he's going to build a wall across the entire border between the United States and Mexico.How?How is he going to make the Mexicans pay for the wall?How?They are a sovereign nation.(END VIDEO CLIP)STEPHANOPOULOS: You're backing him now.What's the answer?CHRISTIE: The answer is he will do it --STEPHANOPOULOS: How?CHRISTIE: -- the fact -- the fact is that he's going to have to answer that question. And he will.You know, George, this is a February -- this is February of a campaign. And let's say this. You look at everybody else on that stage -- and there have been many more specifics from a lot of other folks on that stage. And that was part of my argument during the campaign. But there I am, as somebody who's --(CROSSTALK)STEPHANOPOULOS: Wait, wait a second. We're eight months into this campaign. The wall has been his signature issue. He says it's his go-to line whenever he needs applause. You've now had the Mexican president, two former Mexican presidents, the Mexican foreign minister in ""The Washington Post"" this morning, calls this a racist, ignorant and absurd proposal.You know that Mexico's not going to pay.CHRISTIE: Well, listen, George, I'm -- that's -- what would you expect Mexico to say?That's of course what they're going to say.And the --(CROSSTALK)STEPHANOPOULOS: How is Donald Trump going to force Mexico to pay?CHRISTIE: Listen, I think that there is great ways to be able to use diplomacy and other tools to be able to come to compromise with nations that are both our neighbors and around the world.And we're working on those things. And that's what leadership does. Strong leadership is able to exert those things and be able to talk to folks about what advantages and disadvantages are of certain policies.The fact of the matter is that there won't be any question about Mr. Trump's strength and his resoluteness in terms of getting the things done that he's wanted to get done. That's what his whole career is --STEPHANOPOULOS: But what's the answer to the how? That's the --(CROSSTALK)CHRISTIE: And this is the thing that I said. And he will answer that question. But you know, to me, I'm not answering the question for him this morning. That's his -- that's the way he will answer it.STEPHANOPOULOS: But he hasn't answered it.CHRISTIE: Listen, I think what he's talked about is the trade relationship and working on the trade relationship and he talked about that yesterday. And using that as a lever to get them to do things on immigration. And I think that's a perfectly appropriate way to discuss this and it is a part of the bilateral relationship that should be a part of the conversation --STEPHANOPOULOS: Before you were opposed to terrorists. That's what he's talking about.CHRISTIE: Listen, I'm not saying -- I'm not going to support everything that happens in any campaign. But what I will tell you is is that an appropriate conversation between two countries, there are all types of appropriate conversations to have between two countries. And that's what will happen when Mr. Trump's president.STEPHANOPOULOS: Your signature issue in the campaign was entitlement reform. You've been talking about it for years. You say reforming Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are essential. It's time for a candidate who speaks hard truth.Donald Trump is the only candidate said he's not going to touch Social Security. Here's what you said about that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRISTIE: I say Mr. Trump, what would you do on Social Security?When I become president, the entire country is going to get so wealthy, so amazingly wealthy and rich, that we're not going to have to worry about Social Security.(LAUGHTER)(END VIDEO CLIP)STEPHANOPOULOS: Again, the question is, how?CHRISTIE: Yes. And listen, I think that we need to do something on Social Security. And I've made that really clear. And so listen, Donald Trump and I are not going to agree on every issue.STEPHANOPOULOS: But this is the signature...CHRISTIE: And this...STEPHANOPOULOS: -- issue of your campaign.CHRISTIE: But it doesn't mean that you have to agree on every issue, George. Just -- it's not the signature issue of my campaign. The signature issue of my campaign was national security, keeping America safe and secure from terrorist attacks and making us a better ally and neighbor around the world. That was the signature issue (INAUDIBLE).STEPHANOPOULOS: I want to get to that...CHRISTIE: Now, Social Security is an important issue. And I've laid out my views on that and I'll certainly share my views with the candidate.The fact of the matter is, though, when you look up on that stage, no one else has a plan on Social Security, George.STEPHANOPOULOS: But he said...CHRISTIE: No one -- no one...STEPHANOPOULOS: -- at the debate on Thursday at the end...CHRISTIE: -- no one else has a plan on Social Security.So why aren't we testing all these other candidates, as well...STEPHANOPOULOS: I've -- I've asked all the candidates...CHRISTIE: -- on that -- on that issue?STEPHANOPOULOS: -- about this question...CHRISTIE: And none of them...STEPHANOPOULOS: -- on that issue.CHRISTIE: -- and none of them have an answer.STEPHANOPOULOS: But the question, at the debate on Thursday night, he said the answer on Social Security is eliminating waste, fraud and abuse.In all of your speeches, you said that's not an answer, we need hard truths.CHRISTIE: Listen, I've given my answer on Social Security, George, so I'm not saying -- I'm not disagreeing with what you're saying.What I'm saying to you is that...STEPHANOPOULOS: But you're disagreeing with Donald Trump.CHRISTIE: Well, what I'm saying is that he's going to give more complete answers as time goes on on these issues. And -- and let's hold every candidate to that same standard. Let's hold every candidate to that same standard.The difference in this -- in this race is that some members of the media, and others, want to hold Mr. Trump to a different standard than they want to hold the other candidates to.Let's get Senator Rubio, Senator Cruz...STEPHANOPOULOS: Don't you think they have been more specific...CHRISTIE: -- let's get Governor Kasich...STEPHANOPOULOS: -- than Donald Trump?CHRISTIE: Not on Social Security, they have not. Absolutely not, sir. I'm the only person who put out a specific plan on Social Security. So let's hold everybody to the same standard. And -- and I'm happy to do that.STEPHANOPOULOS: But just to be clear, you do not believe that you can solve the problem of Social Security by eliminating waste, fraud and abuse?CHRISTIE: No, I -- I put out what my plan is on Social Security. And, by the way, that was on a bigger issue. His answer on that was on paying for a tax cut. That was not just on Social Security. It was on paying for a tax cut.STEPHANOPOULOS: He's said that on Social Security many times.But I do want to get to national security, because you're right, you did talk about that and made that a central issue of your campaign, as well. And one of the core issues that Donald Trump has been this ban on having Muslims enter America.Here's what you said about that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRISTIE: The idea of banning all Muslims from this country is ridiculous. And the reason it's ridiculous is because you don't need to do that to make America safe.When Donald Trump said that, he was dead wrong. And he's dead wrong now.(END VIDEO CLIP)STEPHANOPOULOS: Is he dead wrong now?CHRISTIE: Listen, and that's not what he says any longer. He's backed off of that position over the course of time.STEPHANOPOULOS: Only for citizens.CHRISTIE: Over the -- well, but that's a big difference, George. That's a big difference from what his position...STEPHANOPOULOS: He's still banning Muslims...CHRISTIE: -- was.STEPHANOPOULOS: -- from coming into the United States.CHRISTIE: It's a big difference from where the position was and -- and what we need to do for...STEPHANOPOULOS: So you endorse the one he has now?CHRISTIE: -- (INAUDIBLE) excuse me. Let me answer, George.What we need to do is have a coherent national security policy that's very clear, that says that we need to go after folks who want to do harm to this country. And having good, competent law enforcement. Mr. Trump has talked about the idea of making sure we restore NSA authority, he's -- which some people in this race have not been in favor of, like Senator Cruz.He has stood up and said that he wants to make our military stronger, which we need to do. He's stood up for law enforcement in ways that other candidates in this race have not done.So let's not just take one section of it and make that the entire national security policy. There's been a lot of other conversations about it.And by the way, I'll continue to have conversations with him about this as the campaign goes forward, to be able to make all of these things more fulsome.But we're, again, at the end of February, George. This is the -- Donald Trump is going to...STEPHANOPOULOS: (INAUDIBLE) June?CHRISTIE: -- Donald Trump is going to be the Republican nominee for president of the United States. And he is going to bring this race to Hillary Clinton. He is the best candidate to beat Hillary Clinton in November and the best candidate to restore national security for our country.STEPHANOPOULOS: But -- but on -- on the Muslim ban, are you saying now that you endorse the ban on having non-citizen Muslims...CHRISTIE: No, that's not what I'm saying.STEPHANOPOULOS: -- (INAUDIBLE) from the United States?CHRISTIE: I'm saying that that's only one piece of an overall approach to national security.STEPHANOPOULOS: But you disagree with it?CHRISTIE: So I -- I said that very plainly. Listen, George, here's the bottom line. Elections are choices. And you look at the candidates up on the stage and you decide all things considered, who's the best choice.You know, I tell voters this all the time, if you want to vote for the candidate who you agree with 100 percent of the time, go home and look in the mirror.STEPHANOPOULOS: But -- but I...CHRISTIE: You're the only person you agree with 100 percent of the time, whether it's you or me.So you can -- we can sit here this morning and play the game of everything that -- I ran against the guy, so of course there's things that I disagree with him on. But this is now a choice. And of the candidates remaining on that stage, he is the best person to beat Hillary Clinton, which is job one for Republicans. We do not want Hillary Clinton in the White House. He is the best person to beat her and he is the best person to help keep America safe.STEPHANOPOULOS: But to do what?I've just pointed out three of the biggest issues in this campaign, the ones he talks about all the time. You disagree with him on all those issues.So when you say he's going to do what needs to be done, what exactly are you talking about?CHRISTIE: Well, listen, I'm talking about a whole bunch of things.First of all, George, we haven't even touched on the economy. And I think he's got a really solid record and job -- to help create jobs in this country and to make the tax code fairer, to make opportunity better, to lower regulation. He has laid out those plans.The fact is, he's going to do some things for this economy that need to be done to make America safer, not only from a national security perspective, but for people to invest in America again...STEPHANOPOULOS: Besides his tax plan...CHRISTIE: -- and create jobs.STEPHANOPOULOS: -- what are you referring to?CHRISTIE: Well, this -- he's -- he's laid out a plan on regularity reform, to lower regulations in this country. He's talked about the idea of making sure that small business folks are empowered in this country once again, to be able to create jobs for people.There -- there has been a lot of things that have been laid out tin this campaign, um, that -- that merit real consideration and real support.And -- and we're not going to agree on every issue. But I wouldn't agree if I were here this morning supporting any of the other candidates that remain on the stage. We would have some major disagreements with each other, because we ran against each other.But let me tell you, they're minor disagreements compared to what is going to happen if we have Hillary Clinton as president of the United States, who is moving so far to the left to beat Bernie Sanders that I don't know which one is the socialist, Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders.STEPHANOPOULOS: Finally, you...CHRISTIE: -- they're both now.STEPHANOPOULOS: -- finally, you talk about Donald Trump as the person who can be trusted. He still maintains that he saw thousands of people celebrating in New Jersey after the 9/11 attacks. You said that didn't happen, it was not factual.So if he continues to hold that position, isn't that a slander of your state citizens?CHRISTIE: Now, listen, I don't think he means it as that at all, as a slander of my state's citizens. You, what I think, though, is when I say he's -- can be trusted, this is a guy who, when he makes promises, he keeps them. Um, and I've seen that over the course of a 14 year relationship with him.I didn't just meet Donald Trump on the debate stage in August, George, of 2000 and -- and 15. I met Donald Trump in 2002 and have been friends with him since that time and gotten to know him. And the American people out there, you've listened to what's happening, George. The American people see him. They see someone who's strong, who's resolute, who's tough, who is not part of the Washington, DC establishment, that has really messed this country up and disappointed our people, both sides of the aisle.He's going to go down there and take an entirely different approach. That's an approach that America needs. And given the other options on the stage, let me tell you something, he's the strongest, best guy to be our nominee to beat Hillary Clinton and to be the next president of the United States.STEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Christie, thanks for joining us this morning.CHRISTIE: Thank you, George.STEPHANOPOULOS: Lots more ahead with our powerhouse roundtable.Plus, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley and Bernie Sanders join us live.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)STEPHANOPOULOS: We are joined now by Governor Nikki Haley of South Carolina who has endorsed Senator Rubio.Thank you for joining us, Governor Haley.We just heard Marco Rubio say he's going to stay in as long as it takes. But right now, we're looking at these Super Tuesday states. He's behind in every single state right now, has not won a single state yet. How can he go on if he's 0 for 15?GOV. NIKKI HALEY, (R) SOUTH CAROLINA: Oh, this is what we do in elections. You keep fighting until the very end. And that's why you're seeing him do rallies three and four times a day. You don't know until election day. And I think we've seen that in every state. There's been some surprises. And he continues to surprise in every state that he comes to.And if you look at his rallies, they're getting bigger and bigger. And the most amazing part is look at who is in the rallies: young, old, all races, all types of people. He has is really starting a conservative movement that's picking up a lot of people we haven't seen in a long time.STEPHANOPOULOS: You seem to call out Donald Trump in your response to the State of the Union back in January. But it wasn't until this week that we really saw Marco Rubio take on Mr. Trump. Did he wait too long?HALEY: I don't know if he waited too long, but I'll tell you Donald Trump is everything we hear and teach our kids not to do in kindergarten. And we have seen this behavior over and over again that's unacceptable. And I think what we saw from Marco is exactly what we tell our children also, if a bully hits you, you hit back.I think he hit back and he showed that's he's willing to lead. He's willing to fight. And he's going to have the passion to do it.STEPHANOPOULOS: Some would say he's stooping to the same level.HALEY: I don't know if you stoop to the same level. What you don't do is you walk away from it. I mean, again, when a bully comes after you, you go back.I think he punched. I think he punched hard. I think it was on policy. I think he made sure that everybody understood that there are a lot of questions that Donald Trump hasn't answered. It is amazing. I'm going to count it. You could be undergoing an audit. There's no reason he can't release last year's tax returns. Why is he not doing that?And you look at all these issues, this is one more project that Donald Trump is doing. Trump University, Trump Vodka, Trump Airlines, Trump Mortage all failed projects. This is one more project. And we're really concerned about where that's going to be.And I think it's right for Marco to bring those things out and to keep on bringing those out.STEPHANOPOULOS: What will a win for Donald Trump in the nomination fight mean for your party?HALEY: Well, it's scary. I mean, this is where we think these next few states matter, because it will start to ask him the questions and get the answers.You know, he's -- there are two presidential candidates right now undergoing legal issues: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. There's two presidential candidates that are disclosing information: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. And we need to make sure we get that. What we know right now is, we've got a candidate that's being accused of fraud with Trump University. We've got students that have a lawsuit against him.We're seeing a lot of things from Donald Trump with no answers. I've seen him talk about being for universal health care. I've seen him talk about wanting to do things and he's not giving us the answers for it.So, I think what he'll do the Republican Party is really make us question who we are and what we're about. And that's something we don't want to see happen.STEPHANOPOULOS: You just heard Governor Christie say one of the big reasons he's supporting Donald Trump he think he's the only candidate, the only candidate left in this race, who can defeat Hillary Clinton.HALEY: That's just no true. I mean, Chris is a dear friend, but none of us understand why he did this.What I will tell you is, Donald Trump can't be Hillary Clinton. His negatives are so high, his cap is at 35 percent. It is impossible for him to win a general. And so that's why we've said Marco Rubio is the only one that can defeat Donald Trump. And Marco Rubio can beat Hillary Clinton and will win in November.STEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Haley, thanks for joining us this morning.HALEY: Thank you so much, George.STEPHANOPOULOS: We're joined now by Bernie Sanders. He joins us this morning.Thank you for joining us, Senator Sanders. Appreciate you being with us this morning.So what do you make of what happened in South Carolina last night. Nearly a 50 point win for Senator Clinton -- Secretary Clinton.SANDERS: We got decimated, George. We got decimated. The only positive thing for us is we won the actually -- the 29 years of age and younger vote. And that was good. But we got killed.But I'm in Minnesota now. We think we're going to do very well in Minnesota on Super Tuesday, Colorado we're going to do well, Oklahoma we're going to do well. I think we're going to win in Massachusetts. And I believe we're going to win in Vermont. And we're going to do better than people think in other states.George, we began this campaign, as you know, at 3 percent in the polls, 60 or 70 points behind Secretary Clinton. We have come a very long way. Our message about a rigged economy -- rich get richer, everyone else gets poorer -- is resonating.And I'll tell you what else is resonating, a corrupt campaign finance system that's allowing billionaires to buy elections.I think we have the momentum. I think it's going to be a tough fight. I think we can win this thing.STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, and Senator Sanders, from the very start you've been a straight talker to come right out and say you were decimated. You're continuing that tradition as well.Let me just follow up on South Carolina for one second. You saw that vote in the African-American community, something like 85 percent for Hillary Clinton. You've got going forward about 25 percent of the voters in the Democratic primaries are African-Americans. Aren't you going to have to do much better, reach out to that community, to have a chance for this nomination?SANDERS: Yes. Absolutely. But I do think -- no argument with you. You are correct. But I think you're going to see us doing -- and I think the polls indicated it, much better within the African-American community outside of the deep south. You're going to see us much better in New York State where I think we have a shot to win, in California and in Michigan.But you're right, we're going to have to do a lot better.But I think what we are doing is putting together a coalition of working class people, of young people, of many other folks who understand that economy today is not working for the middle class, it's working for the people on top, people who have strong reservations about Secretary Clinton's foreign policy, a vote the war in Iraq.So we think we have come a long way; we think we've got a lot of work in front of us. But, George, I think we can win this.STEPHANOPOULOS: Looking ahead to Super Tuesday, new polls out this morning show Secretary Clinton with large leads in those Southern states you just talked about: Texas, Tennessee and Georgia. She's going to build up delegates there.You're going to win big in your home state of Vermont.Where else can you win on Super Tuesday?And if you don't win in other states, how can you go on?SANDERS: Well, we're going to go on to California, by the way, where we think we have a real shot and where most -- that's the state with the most delegates -- Barb Reich (ph), former Clinton Secretary of Labor, just endorsed me the other day. I think we have a good chance to win in Massachusetts. In Massachusetts, a lot of young people are burdened with this outrageous student debt. The young people and their parents want public colleges and universities, to be tuition free and they want the wealthy and large corporations to start paying their fair share of taxes.We were in Oklahoma the other day, in Tulsa. We had a wonderful, wonderful turnout. We're going to Oklahoma City later today. We were in Texas just yesterday, George. We had 10,000 people out in Austin; 8,000 people out in Dallas. It's a tough state for us. But I think we're going to do better than that polling indicated.So I think we have a shot to win a number of states on Super Tuesday, do better than people thought and think in other states. And I think in some of the larger states like Michigan, New York State, California, we've got a shot to win those states.STEPHANOPOULOS: And as you say, on to California; thanks for joining us this morning, Senator Sanders.SANDERS: Thank you."	1.0

Gov. Terry McAuliffe will no longer have to answer questions about his potential role in a Clinton administration. And U.S. Rep. Robert C. Bobby Scott and a handful of Republican hopefuls can shelve their battle plans for a special election to fill Kaines seat.As Donald Trumps stunning victory over Hillary Clinton rocks national politics, few states are feeling the consequences as swiftly as Virginia.Kaines failure to ascend to the vice presidency simplifies Virginias electoral calendar, but Trumps win shook up the 2017 governors race thats already underway.Corey Stewart, a 2017 GOP gubernatorial hopeful who served as chairman of Trumps Virginia campaign for almost a year but was fired last month for aggressively protesting the Republican National Committee, declared in an interview that Trumps victory propels him to frontrunner status for the GOP nomination. He attacked Republican rival Ed Gillespie, an early leader in gubernatorial fundraising and endorsements, as being insufficiently loyal to the president-elect.Ed Gillespie treated Donald Trump like he had typhoid, Stewart said. He would not appear with him on stage. He would not mention his name unless he was condemning him.A former Republican National Committee chairman, Gillespie has kept his distance from Trump while voicing support for the GOP ticket. He introduced Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, Trumps running mate, at two rallies, but was noticeably absent from the Trump campaigns Virginia leadership committee that included the other two Republican gubernatorial candidates, Rep. Robert J. Wittman, R-1st, and state Sen. Frank W. Wagner, R-Virginia Beach.In a statement, Chris Leavitt, executive director of Gillespies political action committee, said Gillespies support for the Trump-Pence ticket was clear from the beginning.Nows the time to bring our country and party together, but once again Corey is putting his personal political ambitions first, Leavitt said. And if he wants to anoint himself, thats fine. We see how well Hillary Clintons coronation went.With no U.S. Senate vacancy for McAuliffe to fill, the governors race will unfold without the added drama of a special election for Kaines seat. McAuliffes pick would have had to defend the seat in a special election next year and again in 2018 when it comes up for its regularly scheduled election.Scott, D-3rd, was widely seen as the favorite to get the nod from McAuliffe, who declined to publicly discuss Senate prospects until after Election Day.Wittman was rumored to be considering switching to run for Kaines Senate seat if it came open. A spokesman said Wednesday that his plans for 2017 remain the same, adding that Wittman is thrilled to be a part of the chance that Republican victories in the House, Senate and White House represent. Wittman was easily re-elected to his congressional seat Tuesday.With the Senate seat now a moot point for next year, all eyes will be on the governors race.Virginias race is expected to draw national interest as one of only two gubernatorial races along with New Jerseys scheduled for what will be Trumps first year as president.Though Clinton lost nationally, she won Virginia by roughly 5 points, continuing the streak of statewide wins for Democrats. She ran up large margins in the key counties of Fairfax, Loudoun, Prince William and Henrico, a sign that Democrats hold demographic advantages that Republicans have struggled to overcome in state races.The Republican candidate for governor who is selected in a June primary will face Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph S. Northam. Democrats have sought to link the four Republican candidates to Trump. The Democratic Party of Virginia launched a website late last month intended to hold Republican gubernatorial candidates accountable for supporting and enabling the most dangerous candidate to ever be nominated by a major party.But instead of Trump serving as a past embarrassment for Republicans looking to move on, Trump will have taken up residence across the Potomac as Virginians choose a new leader.In a statement, Northam congratulated Trump and said he was disappointed in the result but proud of Clinton and Kaine.We will continue to advocate for our values like defending womens access to reproductive health care and equality while building on our economic progress by focusing on workforce development, attracting new industries and promoting our quality of life, Northam said.Stewart, a Prince William supervisor, said he hopes to implement the Trump agenda on a state level by cracking down on illegal immigration, replacing the Affordable Care Act and scrapping regulations on businesses.But Stewarts decision to take part in a protest outside the RNCs headquarters in Washington seems to have burned bridges with the Trump campaign.Mike Rubino, the Trump campaigns Virginia state director, said Stewart acted like a petulant child and hurt Trumps chances by dividing the party.He constantly pitted people against each other, Rubino said. He was actively running for governor on my bosss coattails while my boss was seeking the highest office in the land. That, to me, is disloyalty.Stewart called his alliance with Trump a Hail Mary pass thats now paying off.Ive embraced Trump and defended him when other people wouldnt, Stewart said. And I believe that loyalty will be returned.#inform-video-player-3 .inform-embed { margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; }	1.0

Unclassified @HillaryClinton emails should be released. You can see mine, here jebbushemails.com.” Bush’s attempt to score quick political points exposes him to a powerful hypocrisy attack. As governor, Bush used private emails; thus far he has not disclosed them all. There is even early media speculation that Bush’s actions may have skirted Florida law.Key Points:Bush used a personal email address as governor, and there are messages missing. As the Washington Post reporters, “Bush used his personal email address, jeb@jeb.org, to conduct official, political, and personal business…” but Bush’s email disclosure website (which was already public and available at the Florida state archives) lacks many key messages, including any messages between Jeb Bush and his brother, then-President George W. Bush.Media accounts establish that Bush, not the State of Florida, decided which private emails to disclose – apparently nothing would have stopped the Bush team from selectively leaving out politically problematic emails. As the Tampa Bay Times reported, “The Bush files, though enormous, are not complete” because they lacked “emails the governor deemed not relevant to the public record.” In other words, Bush selected what was “relevant” or not for the public record, not civil servants.The numbers do not add up. In 2007 Bush claimed he received 2.5 million emails on his public accounts, and 550,000 emails on his private accounts (Source, Naples Daily News, 7/12/07 ). Bush’s “disclosure” only contains a total of 250,000 emails. (Source, New York Times, 2/9/15 )There are media reports that Bush only recently “completed” handing over emails, despite leaving office eight years ago, potentially violating the law. A Bloomberg politics reporter Michael Bender tweeted today that “FL law requires govs to turn over emails after leaving office. Jeb didn’t finish turning over emails until last year.” He further tweeted that “Bush may not have complied with FL law until considering a presidential campaign. 119.021(4)(a).” That statute requires that “Whoever has custody of any public records shall deliver [them], at the expiration of his or her term of office…” American Bridge researchers submitted a records request today in an effort to confirm or disconfirm the allegation.Media reports indicate Bush also housed his private emails on a personally owned email server. Today, MSNBC political correspondent Kaise Hunt tweeted that “Jeb Bush owns the server that hosts his personal email, his spokeswoman says.”Bush Conducted Public Business Over Private Email; Hand Selected Which To Turn Over To ArchiveTampa Bay Times: Bush Conducted All His Communication On His Private Jeb@Jeb.Org Account; Hand-Selected Which To Turn Over To The State Archive. According to the Tampa Bay Times, “The former governor conducted all his communication on his private Jeb@jeb.org account and turned over the hand-selected batch to the state archives when he left office. Absent from the stash are emails the governor deemed not relevant to the public record: those relating to politics, fundraising and personal matters while he was governor. Compared to Scott, however, who rarely communicates by email, the contrast is stark.’ [Tampa Bay Times, 1/3/15 ]Tampa Bay Times: Bush Released Private Emails Used For State Business; Files “Are Not Complete.” According to the Tampa Bay Times, “The files released from the state archive resulted in a stream of positive national press for the former governor — ‘Jeb Bush’s emails depict a hands-on governor,’ the Washington Post proclaimed. ‘Jeb answered immigrant pleas,’ the Hill wrote. Polls now show that if Bush announces, he will be considered the front-runner. The Bush files, though enormous, are not complete, however.” [Tampa Bay Times, 1/3/15 ]As Governor, Jeb Bush Had Three Email Accounts, Including Jeb@Jeb.Org ; According to the Washington Post, “In three follow-up e-mails (which Bush also answers promptly), the governor reveals: He has three e-mail accounts, receives 200 to 300 a day onJeb@Jeb.org and reads most of them. He guesses that 25 percent of the e-mails come from colleagues, 50 percent from constituents, 10 percent from family and friends and 15 percent from junk mail and list mail. The risk, he says, is in relying too much on e-mail, at the expense of face-to-face nuance. ‘There is always [the] threat of invading family time!’ he writes.” [The Washington Post, 2/21/03 ]Bush Continued To Use The Private Jeb@Jeb.Org Email After Leaving The Governorship [Email from Jeb Bush To Matt Castner, 6/5/08 ]Bush Estimated 25 Percent Of Email Traffic Came From Colleagues.

According to the Naples Daily News, “Jeb Bush learned plenty during his eight years as Florida governor, he told a crowd at a United Christian Giving fundraiser in Fort Myers on Thursday. The president’s little brother and former president’s son took few partisan shots, mostly entertaining the crowd with stories from ‘Mount Tallahassee.’ […] Bush said he got 550,000 e-mails on his private account and another 2.5 million on his public account during his eight years as governor. That helped him stay in touch with the people of the state even though the capital is far removed geographically from most of the population.” [Naples Daily News, 7/12/07 ]Jeb Bush Said He Got 2.5 Million E-Mails On His Public Account During His Eight Years As Governor.

According to the New York Times, “Jeb Bush said he would launch a website on Tuesday on which he will make available about 250,000 emails from his time as governor of Florida, as well as the first chapter of an e-book about his administration. The emails, which were obtained by a number of news media organizations through a public records request in December, show Mr. Bush’s style in communicating with both his staff and his constituents.” [New York Times, 2/9/15 ]Jeb Bush Said He Will Release 250,000 Emails From His Two Terms In Office. According to CNN, “Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said on Sunday he will release 250,000 emails from his two terms in office and write an eBook outlining his governing philosophy. The moves have set the political sphere atwitter with speculation he’s closer than ever to deciding to run for president in 2016. In what appears to be a move of classic political procedure — getting ahead of the opposition — Bush told WPLG-TV that his intention is to promote transparency.” [CNN, 12/31/14 ]Press Speculation On Bush Email Release DelayMichael Bender: Jeb Bush Did Not Finish Turning Over Emails Until 2014 Even Though Florida Law Required Governors To Turn over Emails After Leaving Office. According to a tweet from Bloomberg political reporter Michael C.

DAVID MUIR: Mr. President, it's an honor to be here at the White House. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you very much, David. DAVID MUIR: Let me ask you, has the magnitude of this job hit you yet? PRESIDENT TRUMP: It has periodically hit me. And it is a tremendous magnitude. And where you really see it is when you're talking to the generals about problems in the world. And we do have problems in the world. Big problems. The business also hits because the -- the size of it. The size. I was with the Ford yesterday. And with General Motors yesterday. The top representatives, great people. And they're gonna do some tremendous work in the United States. They're gonna build plants back in the United States. But when you see the size, even as a businessman, the size of the investment that these big companies are gonna make, it hits you even in that regard. But we're gonna bring jobs back to America, like I promised on the campaign trail. DAVID MUIR: And we're gonna get to it all right here. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Good. DAVID MUIR: Mr. President, I want to start -- we're five days in. And your campaign promises. I know today you plan on signing the order to build the wall. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Correct. DAVID MUIR: Are you going to direct U.S. funds to pay for this wall? Will American taxpayers pay for the wall? PRESIDENT TRUMP: Ultimately it'll come out of what's happening with Mexico. We're gonna be starting those negotiations relatively soon. And we will be in a form reimbursed by Mexico which I will say ... DAVID MUIR: So, they'll pay us back? PRESIDENT TRUMP: Yeah, absolutely, 100 percent. DAVID MUIR: So, the American taxpayer will pay for the wall at first? PRESIDENT TRUMP: All it is, is we'll be reimbursed at a later date from whatever transaction we make from Mexico. Now, I could wait a year and I could hold off the wall. But I wanna build the wall. We have to build the wall. We have to stop drugs from pouring in. We have to stop people from just pouring into our country. We have no idea where they're from. And I campaigned on the wall. And it's very important. But that wall will cost us nothing. DAVID MUIR: But you talked -- often about Mexico paying for the wall. And you, again, say they'll pay us back. Mexico's president said in recent days that Mexico absolutely will not pay, adding that, ""It goes against our dignity as a country and our dignity as Mexicans."" He says ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: David, he has to say that. He has to say that. But I'm just telling you there will be a payment. It will be in a form, perhaps a complicated form. And you have to understand what I'm doing is good for the United States. It's also going to be good for Mexico. We wanna have a very stable, very solid Mexico. Even more solid than it is right now. And they need it also. Lots of things are coming across Mexico that they don't want. I think it's going to be a good thing for both countries. And I think the relationship will be better than ever before. You know, when we had a prisoner in Mexico, as you know, two years ago, that we were trying to get out. And Mexico was not helping us, I will tell you, those days are over. I think we're gonna end up with a much better relationship with Mexico. We will have the wall and in a very serious form Mexico will pay for the wall. DAVID MUIR: What are you gonna say to some of your supporters who might say, ""Wait a minute, I thought Mexico was going to pay for this right at the start."" PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I'd say very simply that they are going to pay for it. I never said they're gonna pay from the start. I said Mexico will pay for the wall. But what I will tell my supporters is, ""Would you like me to wait two years or three years before I make this deal?"" Because we have to make a deal on NAFTA. We have to make a new trade deal with Mexico because we're getting clobbered. We have a $60-billion trade deficit. So, if you want, I can wait two years and then we can do it nice and easily. I wanna start the wall immediately. Every supporter I have -- I have had so many people calling and tweeting and -- and writing letters saying they're so happy about it. I wanna start the wall. We will be reimbursed for the wall. DAVID MUIR: When does construction begin? PRESIDENT TRUMP: As soon as we can. As soon as we can physically do it. We're ... DAVID MUIR: Within months? PRESIDENT TRUMP: I would say in months. Yeah, I would say in months. Certainly planning is starting immediately. DAVID MUIR: People feel ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: We'll be having some really good, really solid plans within a short period of time. DAVID MUIR: When people learn of the news of this wall today there are gonna be a lot of people listening to this. And I wanna ask about undocumented immigrants who are here -- in this country. Right now they're protected as so-called dreamers -- the children who were brought here, as you know, by their parents. Should they be worried -- that they could be deported? And is there anything you can say to assure them right now that they'll be allowed to stay? PRESIDENT TRUMP: They shouldn't be very worried. They are here illegally. They shouldn't be very worried. I do have a big heart. We're going to take care of everybody. We're going to have a very strong border. We're gonna have a very solid border. Where you have great people that are here that have done a good job, they should be far less worried. We'll be coming out with policy on that over the next period of four weeks. DAVID MUIR: But Mr. President, will they be allowed to stay? PRESIDENT TRUMP: I'm gonna tell you over the next four weeks. But I will tell you, we're looking at this, the whole immigration situation, we're looking at it with great heart. Now we have criminals that are here. We have really bad people that are here. Those people have to be worried 'cause they're getting out. We're gonna get them out. We're gonna get 'em out fast. General Kelly is -- I've given that as his number one priority. DAVID MUIR: Senator Jeff Sessions, your pick for attorney general, as you know during his confirmation hearing said that ending DACA, this is President Obama's policy protecting the dreamers -- that, ""Ending it certainly would be constitutional."" That you could end the protection of these dreamers. Is that a possibility? PRESIDENT TRUMP: We're gonna be talking with -- attorney general. He will soon be the attorney general. He's done fantastically well. We're all very proud of him. I thought he was treated very, very unfairly. He's a brilliant man and he's a very good man. He'll do a fantastic job. I'll be speaking to him as soon as he's affirmed. DAVID MUIR: So, it's a possibility. PRESIDENT TRUMP: We will be talking to the attorney general. DAVID MUIR: I wanna ask you about something you said this week right here at the White House. You brought in congressional leaders to the White House. You spoke at length about the presidential election with them -- telling them that you lost the popular vote because of millions of illegal votes, 3 to 5 million illegal votes. That would be the biggest electoral fraud in American history. Where is the evidence of that? PRESIDENT TRUMP: So, let me tell you first of all, it was so misrepresented. That was supposed to be a confidential meeting. And you weren't supposed to go out and talk to the press as soon as you -- but the Democrats viewed it not as a confidential meeting. DAVID MUIR: But you have tweeted ... DAVID MUIR: ... about the millions of illegals ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: Sure. And I do -- and I'm very ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: ... and I mean it. But just so you -- it was supposed to be a confidential meeting. They turned it into not a con... Number two, the conversation lasted for about a minute. They made it -- somebody said it was, like, 25 percent of the ... It wasn't. It was hardly even discussed. I said it. And I said it strongly because what's going on with voter fraud is horrible. That's number one. Number two, I would've won the popular vote if I was campaigning for the popular vote. I would've gone to California where I didn't go at all. I would've gone to New York where I didn't campaign at all. I would've gone to a couple of places that I didn't go to. And I would've won that much easier than winning the electoral college. But as you know, the electoral college is all that matters. It doesn't make any difference. So, I would've won very, very easily. But it's a different form of winning. You would campaign much differently. You would have a totally different campaign. So, but ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: ... you're just asking a question. I would've easily won the popular vote, much easier, in my opinion, than winning the electoral college. I ended up going to 19 different states. I went to the state of Maine four times for one. I needed one. I went to M-- I got it, by the way. But it turned out I didn't need it because we ended up winning by a massive amount, 306. I needed 270. We got 306. You and everybody said, ""There's no way you get to 270."" I mean, your network said and almost everybody said, ""There's no way you can get to ..."" So, I went to Maine four times. I went to various places. And that's the beauty of the electoral college. With that being said, if you look at voter registration, you look at the dead people that are registered to vote who vote, you look at people that are registered in two states, you look at all of these different things that are happening with registration. You take a look at those registration for -- you're gonna s-- find -- and we're gonna do an investigation on it. DAVID MUIR: But 3 to 5 million illegal votes? PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, we're gonna find out. But it could very well be that much. Absolutely. PRESIDENT TRUMP: But we're gonna find out. PRESIDENT TRUMP: In fact, I heard one of the other side, they were saying it's not 3 to 5. It's not 3 to 5. I said, ""Well, Mr. Trump is talking about registration, tell--"" He said, ""You know we don't wanna talk about registration."" They don't wanna talk about registration. You have people that are registered who are dead, who are illegals, who are in two states. You have people registered in two states. They're registered in a New York and a New Jersey. They vote twice. There are millions of votes, in my opinion. Now ... DAVID MUIR: But again ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: I'm doing an ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: ... investigation. David, David, David ... DAVID MUIR: You’re now, you’re now president of the United States when you say ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: Of course, and I want the voting process to be legitimate. DAVID MUIR: But what I'm asking ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: The people that ... DAVID MUIR: ... what I'm asking that -- when you say in your opinion millions of illegal votes, that is something that is extremely fundamental to our functioning democracy, a fair and free election. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Sure. Sure. Sure. DAVID MUIR: You say you're gonna launch an investigation. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Sure, done. DAVID MUIR: What you have presented so far has been debunked. It's been called ... DAVID MUIR: ... false. PRESIDENT TRUMP: No, it hasn't. Take a look at the Pew reports. DAVID MUIR: I called the author of the Pew report last night. And he told me that they found no evidence of voter ... DAVID MUIR: ... fraud. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Really? Then why did he write the report? DAVID MUIR: He said no evidence of voter fraud. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Excuse me, then why did he write the report? PRESIDENT TRUMP: According to Pew report, then he's -- then he's groveling again. You know, I always talk about the reporters that grovel when they wanna write something that you wanna hear but not necessarily millions of people wanna hear or have to hear. DAVID MUIR: So, you’ve launched an investigation? PRESIDENT TRUMP: We're gonna launch an investigation to find out. And then the next time -- and I will say this, of those votes cast, none of 'em come to me. None of 'em come to me. They would all be for the other side. None of 'em come to me. But when you look at the people that are registered: dead, illegal and two states and some cases maybe three states -- we have a lot to look into. DAVID MUIR: House Speaker Paul Ryan has said, ""I have seen no evidence. I have made this very, very clear."" Senator Lindsey Graham saying, ""It's the most inappropriate thing for a president to say without proof. He seems obsessed with the idea that he could not have possibly lost the popular vote without cheating and fraud."" I wanna ask you about something bigger here. Does it matter more now ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: There's nothing bigger. There's nothing bigger. DAVID MUIR: But it is important because ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: Let me just tell you, you know what's important, millions of people agree with me when I say that if you would’ve looked on one of the other networks and all of the people that were calling in they're saying, ""We agree with Mr. Trump. We agree."" They're very smart people. The people that voted for me -- lots of people are saying they saw things happen. I heard stories also. But you're not talking about millions. But it's a small little segment. I will tell you, it's a good thing that we're doing because at the end we're gonna have an idea as to what's going on. Now, you're telling me Pew report has all of a sudden changed. But you have other reports and you have other statements. You take a look at the registrations, how many dead people are there? Take a look at the registrations as to the other things that I already presented. DAVID MUIR: And you're saying ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: And you're gonna find ... DAVID MUIR: ... those people who are on the rolls voted, that there are millions of illegal votes? PRESIDENT TRUMP: I didn't say there are millions. But I think there could very well be millions of people. That's right. DAVID MUIR: You tweeted though ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: And I also say this ... DAVID MUIR: ... you tweeted, ""If you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally, I won the popular vote."" PRESIDENT TRUMP: David, and I also say this, if I was going for the popular vote I would've won easily. But I would've been in California and New York. I wouldn't have been in Maine. I wouldn't have been in Iowa. I wouldn't have been in Nebraska and all of those states that I had to win in order to win this. I would've been in New York, I would've been in California. I never even went there. DAVID MUIR: Let me just ask you, you did win. You're the president. You're sitting ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: That’s true. DAVID MUIR: ... across from me right now. PRESIDENT TRUMP: That's true. DAVID MUIR: Do you think that your words matter more now? PRESIDENT TRUMP: Yes, very much. DAVID MUIR: Do you think that that talking about millions of illegal votes is dangerous to this country without presenting the evidence? PRESIDENT TRUMP: No, not at all. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Not at all because many people feel the same way that I do. And ... DAVID MUIR: You don't think it undermines your credibility if there’s no evidence? PRESIDENT TRUMP: No, not at all because they didn't come to me. Believe me. Those were Hillary votes. And if you look at it they all voted for Hillary. They all voted for Hillary. They didn't vote for me. I don't believe I got one. Okay, these are people that voted for Hillary Clinton. And if they didn't vote, it would've been different in the popular. Now, you have to understand I -- I focused on those four or five states that I had to win. Maybe she didn't. She should've gone to Michigan. She thought she had it in the bag. She should've gone to Wisconsin, she thought she had it because you're talking about 38 years of, you know, Democrat wins. But they didn't. I went to Michigan, I went to Wisconsin. I went to Pennsylvania all the time. I went to all of the states that are -- Florida and North Carolina. That's all I focused on. DAVID MUIR: Mr. President, it does strike me though that we're relitigating the presidential campaign, the election ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: No, no. We're looking at it for the next time. No, no, you have to understand, I had a tremendous victory, one of the great victories ever. In terms of counties I think the most ever or just about the most ever. When you look at a map it's all red. Red meaning us, Republicans. One of the greatest victories ever. But, again, I ran for the electoral college. I didn't run for the popular vote. What I'm saying is if there are these problems that many people agree with me that there might be. Look, Barack Obama -- if you look back -- eight years ago when he first ran -- he was running for office in Chicago for we needed Chicago vote. And he was laughing at the system because he knew all of those votes were going to him. You look at Philadelphia, you look at what's going on in Philadelphia. But take a look at the tape of Barack Obama who wrote me, by the way, a very beautiful letter in the drawer of the desk. Very beautiful. And I appreciate it. But look at what he said, it's on tape. Look at what he said about voting in Chicago eight years ago. It's not changed. It hasn't changed, believe me. Chicago, look what's going on in Chicago. It's only gotten worse. But he was smiling and laughing about the vote in Chicago. Now, once he became president he didn't do that. All of a sudden it became this is the foundation of our country. So, here's the point, you have a lot of stuff going on possibly. I say probably. But possibly. We're gonna get to the bottom of it. And then we're gonna make sure it doesn't happen again. If people are registered wrongly, if illegals are registered to vote, which they are, if dead people are registered to vote and voting, which they do. There are some. I don't know how many. We're gonna try finding that out and the other categories that we talk about, double states where they're -- registered in two states, we're gonna get to the bottom of it because we have to stop it. Because I agree, so important. But the other side is trying to downplay this. Now, I'll say this -- I think that if that didn't happen, first of all, would -- would be a great thing if it didn't happen. But I believe it did happen. And I believe a part of the vote would've been much different. DAVID MUIR: And you believe millions of illegal votes ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, we're gonna find out. DAVID MUIR: Let me ask you this ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: We're gonna find out. And -- and, by the way, when I say you're gonna find out. You can never really find, you know, there are gonna be -- no matter what numbers we come up with there are gonna be lots of people that did things that we're not going to find out about. But we will find out because we need a better system where that can't happen. DAVID MUIR: Mr. President, I just have one more question on this. And it's -- it's bigger picture. You took some heat after your visit to the CIA in front of that hallowed wall, 117 stars -- of those lost at the CIA. You talked about other things. But you also talked about crowd size at the inauguration, about the size of your rallies, about covers on Time magazine. And I just wanna ask you when does all of that matter just a little less? When do you let it roll off your back now that you're the president? PRESIDENT TRUMP: OK, so I'm glad you asked. So, I went to the CIA, my first step. I have great respect for the people in intelligence and CIA. I'm -- I don't have a lot of respect for, in particular one of the leaders. But that's okay. But I have a lot of respect for the people in the CIA. That speech was a home run. That speech, if you look at Fox, OK, I'll mention you -- we see what Fox said. They said it was one of the great speeches. They showed the people applauding and screaming and -- and they were all CIA. There was -- somebody was asking Sean -- ""Well, were they Trump people that were put--"" we don't have Trump people. They were CIA people. That location was given to me. Mike Pence went up before me, paid great homage to the wall. I then went up, paid great homage to the wall. I then spoke to the crowd. I got a standing ovation. In fact, they said it was the biggest standing ovation since Peyton Manning had won the Super Bowl and they said it was equal. I got a standing ovation. It lasted for a long period of time. What you do is take -- take out your tape -- you probably ran it live. I know when I do good speeches. I know when I do bad speeches. That speech was a total home run. They loved it. I could've ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: ... gotten ... DAVID MUIR: You would give the same speech if you went back ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: Absolutely. DAVID MUIR: ... in front of that wall? PRESIDENT TRUMP: People loved it. They loved it. They gave me a standing ovation for a long period of time. They never even sat down, most of them, during the speech. There was love in the room. You and other networks covered it very inaccurately. I hate to say this to you and you probably won't put it on but turn on Fox and see how it was covered. And see how people respond to that speech. That speech was a good speech. And you and a couple of other networks tried to downplay that speech. And it was very, very unfortunate that you did. The people of the CIA loved the speech. If I was going to take a vote in that room, there were, like, 300, 350 people, over 1,000 wanted to be there but they couldn't. They were all CIA people. I would say I would've gotten 350 to nothing in that room. That's what the vote would've been. That speech was a big hit, a big success -- success. And then I came back and I watched you on television and a couple of others. DAVID MUIR: Not me personally. PRESIDENT TRUMP: And they tried to demean. Excuse me? DAVID MUIR: Not me personally. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Not you personally but your network -- and they tried to demean the speech. And I know when things are good or bad. A poll just came out on my inauguration speech which was extraordinary that people loved it. Loved and liked. And it was an extraordinary poll. DAVID MUIR: I guess that's what I'm getting at. You talked about the poll, the people loving your inaugural speech and the size of your ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: No, because you bring it up. DAVID MUIR: I'm asking, well, on day one you ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, you just brought it up. I didn't bring it up. I didn't wanna -- talk about the inauguration speech. But I think I did a very good job and people really liked it. You saw the poll. Just came out this morning. You bring it up. I didn't bring it up. DAVID MUIR: So, polls and crowd size and covers on Time, those still matter now that you're here as president. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, you keep bringing it up. I had a massive amount of people here. They were showing pictures that were very unflattering, as unflattering -- from certain angles -- that were taken early and lots of other things. I'll show you a picture later if you’d like of a massive crowd. In terms of a total audience including television and everything else that you have we had supposedly the biggest crowd in history. The audience watching the show. And I think you would even agree to that. They say I had the biggest crowd in the history of inaugural speeches. I'm honored by that. But I didn't bring it up. You just brought it up. DAVID MUIR: See, I -- I'm not interested in the inaugural crowd size. I think the American people can look at images side by side and decide for themselves. I am curious about the first full day here at the White House, choosing to send the press secretary out into the briefing room, summoning reporters to talk about the inaugural crowd size. Does that send a message to the American people that that's -- that's more important than some of the very pressing issues? PRESIDENT TRUMP: Part of my whole victory was that the men and women of this country who have been forgotten will never be forgotten again. Part of that is when they try and demean me unfairly 'cause we had a massive crowd of people. We had a crowd -- I looked over that sea of people and I said to myself, ""Wow."" And I've seen crowds before. Big, big crowds. That was some crowd. When I looked at the numbers that happened to come in from all of the various sources, we had the biggest audience in the history of inaugural speeches. I said the men and women that I was talking to who came out and voted will never be forgotten again. Therefore I won't allow you or other people like you to demean that crowd and to demean the people that came to Washington, D.C., from faraway places because they like me. But more importantly they like what I'm saying. DAVID MUIR: I just wanna say I didn't demean anyone who was in that crowd. We did coverage for hours ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: No, I think you’re demeaning by talking the way you're talking. I think you're demeaning. And that's why I think a lot of people turned on you and turned on a lot of other people. And that's why you have a 17 percent approval rating, which is pretty bad. DAVID MUIR: Mr. Trump, let's talk about many of the things that have happened this week. Chicago. Last night you tweeted about the murder rate in Chicago saying, ""If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible carnage going on I will send in the feds."" PRESIDENT TRUMP: Right. DAVID MUIR: You will send in the feds? What do you mean by that? PRESIDENT TRUMP: It's carnage. You know, in my speech I got tremendous -- from certain people the word carnage. It is carnage. It's horrible carnage. This is Afghanistan -- is not like what's happening in Chicago. People are being shot left and right. Thousands of people over a period -- over a short period of time. This year, which has just started, is worse than last year, which was a catastrophe. They're not doing the job. Now if they want help, I would love to help them. I will send in what we have to send in. Maybe they're not gonna have to be so politically correct. Maybe they're being overly political correct. Maybe there's something going on. But you can't have those killings going on in Chicago. Chicago is like a war zone. Chicago is worse than some of the people that you report in some of the places that you report about every night ... DAVID MUIR: So, I will send ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: ... in the Middle East. DAVID MUIR: ... you mentioned federal assistance. There's federal assistance and then there's sending in the feds. I'm just curious would you take action on your own? PRESIDENT TRUMP: I want them to fix the problem. You can't have thousands of people being shot in a city, in a country that I happen to be president of. Maybe it's okay if somebody else is president. I want them to fix the problem. They have a problem that's very easily fixable. They're gonna have to get tougher and stronger and smarter. But they gotta fix the problem. I don't want to have thousands of people shot in a city where essentially I'm the president. I love Chicago. I know Chicago. And Chicago is a great city, can be a great city. DAVID MUIR: And if they’re unable to fix it? PRESIDENT TRUMP: It can't be a great city. Excuse me. It can't be a great city if people are shot walking down the street for a loaf of bread. Can't be a great city. DAVID MUIR: And if they are unable to fix it, that's when you would send in the feds? PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, so far they have been unable. It’s been going on for years. And I wasn't president. So, look, when President Obama was there two weeks ago making a speech, very nice speech. Two people were shot and killed during his speech. You can't have that. DAVID MUIR: Let me ask ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: They weren't shot at the speech. But they were shot in the city of Chicago during his speech. What -- what's going on? So, all I'm saying is to the mayor who came up to my office recently -- I say, ""You have to smarten up and you have to toughen up because you can't let that happen. That's a war zone."" DAVID MUIR: So, this is an ""or else."" This is a warning? PRESIDENT TRUMP: I want them to straighten out the problem. It's a big problem. DAVID MUIR: Let me ask you about a new report that you were poised to lift a ban on so-called CIA black sites of prisons around the world that have been used in the past. Is that true? PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I'll be talking about that in about two hours. So, you'll be there and you'll be able to see it for yourself. DAVID MUIR: Are you gonna lift the ban? PRESIDENT TRUMP: You're gonna see in about two hours. DAVID MUIR: The last president, President Obama, said the U.S. does not torture. Will you say that? PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I have a general who I have great respect for, General Mattis, who said -- I was a little surprised -- who said he's not a believer in torture. As you know, Mr. Pompeo was just approved, affirmed by the Senate. He's a fantastic guy, he's gonna be the head of the CIA. And you have somebody fabulous as opposed to the character that just got out who didn't -- was not fabulous at all. And he will I think do a great job. And he is -- you know, I haven't gone into great detail. But I will tell you I have spoken to others in intelligence. And they are big believers in, as an example, waterboarding. DAVID MUIR: You did tell me ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: Because they say it does work. It does work. DAVID MUIR: Mr. President, you ... DAVID MUIR: Mr. President, you told me during one of the debates that you would bring back waterboarding and a hell of a lot worse. PRESIDENT TRUMP: I would do ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: I would do -- I wanna keep our country safe. I wanna keep our country safe. DAVID MUIR: What does that mean? PRESIDENT TRUMP: When they're shooting -- when they're chopping off the heads of our people and other people, when they're chopping off the heads of people because they happen to be a Christian in the Middle East, when ISIS is doing things that nobody has ever heard of since Medieval times, would I feel strongly about waterboarding? As far as I'm concerned we have to fight fire with fire. Now, with that being said I'm going with General Mattis. I'm going with my secretary because I think Pompeo's gonna be phenomenal. I'm gonna go with what they say. But I have spoken as recently as 24 hours ago with people at the highest level of intelligence. And I asked them the question, ""Does it work? Does torture work?"" And the answer was, ""Yes, absolutely."" DAVID MUIR: You're now the president. Do you want waterboarding? PRESIDENT TRUMP: I don't want people to chop off the citizens or anybody's heads in the Middle East. Okay? Because they're Christian or Muslim or anything else. I don't want -- look, you are old enough to have seen a time that was much different. You never saw heads chopped off until a few years ago. Now they chop 'em off and they put 'em on camera and they send 'em all over the world. So we have that and we're not allowed to do anything. We're not playing on an even field. I will say this, I will rely on Pompeo and Mattis and my group. And if they don't wanna do, that's fine. If they do wanna do, then I will work for that end. I wanna do everything within the bounds of what you're allowed to do legally. But do I feel it works? Absolutely I feel it works. Have I spoken to people at the top levels and people that have seen it work? I haven't seen it work. But I think it works. Have I spoken to people that feel strongly about it? Absolutely. DAVID MUIR: So, you'd be okay with it as ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: I wanna keep ... DAVID MUIR: ... president? PRESIDENT TRUMP: ... no, I wanna -- I will rely on General Mattis. And I'm gonna rely on those two people and others. And if they don't wanna do it, it's 100 percent okay with me. Do I think it works? Absolutely. DAVID MUIR: Mr. President, I wanna ask you about refugees. You're about to sign a sweeping executive action to suspend immigration to this country. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Right. DAVID MUIR: Who are we talking about? Is this the Muslim ban? PRESIDENT TRUMP: We're talking about -- no it's not the Muslim ban. But it's countries that have tremendous terror. It's countries that we're going to be spelling out in a little while in the same speech. And it's countries that people are going to come in and cause us tremendous problems. Our country has enough problems without allowing people to come in who, in many cases or in some cases, are looking to do tremendous destruction. PRESIDENT TRUMP: You look at what's happening ... DAVID MUIR: Which countries are we talking about? PRESIDENT TRUMP: ... you'll be hearing about it in two hours because I have a whole list. You'll be very thrilled. You're looking at people that come in, in many cases, in some cases with evil intentions. I don't want that. They're ISIS. They're coming under false pretense. I don't want that. I'm gonna be the president of a safe country. We have enough problems. Now I'll absolutely do safe zones in Syria for the people. I think that Europe has made a tremendous mistake by allowing these millions of people to go into Germany and various other countries. And all you have to do is take a look. It's -- it's a disaster what's happening over there. I don't want that to happen here. Now with that being said, President Obama and Hillary Clinton have, and Kerry have allowed tens of thousands of people into our country. The FBI is now investigating more people than ever before having to do with terror. They -- and it's from the group of people that came in. So look, look, our country has a lot of problems. Believe me. I know what the problems are even better than you do. They're deep problems, they're serious problems. We don't need more. DAVID MUIR: Let me ask you about some of the countries that won't be on the list, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia. Why are we going to allow people to come into this country ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: You're going to see -- you're going to see. We're going to have extreme vetting in all cases. And I mean extreme. And we're not letting people in if we think there's even a little chance of some problem. DAVID MUIR: Are you at all ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: We are excluding certain countries. But for other countries we're gonna have extreme vetting. It's going to be very hard to come in. Right now it's very easy to come in. It's gonna be very, very hard. I don't want terror in this country. You look at what happened in San Bernardino. You look at what happened all over. You look at what happened in the World Trade Center. Okay, I mean, take that as an example. DAVID MUIR: Are you at all ... DAVID MUIR: ... concerned -- are you at all concerned it's going to cause more anger among Muslims ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: Anger? DAVID MUIR: ... the world? PRESIDENT TRUMP: There's plenty of anger right now. How can you have more? DAVID MUIR: You don't think it'll ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: Look, David ... DAVID MUIR: ... exacerbate the problem? PRESIDENT TRUMP: ... David, I mean, I know you're a sophisticated guy. The world is a mess. The world is as angry as it gets. What? You think this is gonna cause a little more anger? The world is an angry place. All of this has happened. We went into Iraq. We shouldn't have gone into Iraq. We shouldn't have gotten out the way we got out. The world is a total mess. Take a look at what's happening with Aleppo. Take a look what's happening in Mosul. Take a look what's going on in the Middle East. And people are fleeing and they're going into Europe and all over the place. The world is a mess, David. DAVID MUIR: You brought up Iraq and something you said that could affect American troops in recent days. You said, ""We should've kept the oil but okay maybe we'll have another chance."" What did you mean by that? PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, we should've kept the oil when we got out. And, you know, it's very interesting, had we taken the oil, you wouldn't have ISIS because they fuel themselves with the oil. That's where they got the money. They got the money from leaving -- when we left, we left Iraq, which wasn't a government. It's not a government now. And by the way, and I said something else, if we go in and do this. You have two nations, Iraq and Iran. And they were essentially the same military strength. And they'd fight for decades and decades. They'd fight forever. And they'd keep fighting and it would go -- it was just a way of life. We got in, we decapitated one of those nations, Iraq. I said, ""Iran is taking over Iraq."" That's essentially what happened. DAVID MUIR: So, you believe we can go in and take the oil. PRESIDENT TRUMP: We should have taken the oil. You wouldn't have ISIS if we took the oil. Now I wasn't talking about it from the standpoint of ISIS because the way we got out was horrible. We created a vacuum and ISIS formed. But had we taken the oil something else would've very good happened. They would not have been able to fuel their rather unbelievable drive to destroy large portions of the world. DAVID MUIR: You've heard the critics who say that would break all international law, taking the oil. But I wanna get to the words ... DAVID MUIR: ... that you ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: Wait, wait, can you believe that? Who are the critics who say that? Fools. DAVID MUIR: Let, let me ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: I don't call them critics. I call them fools. DAVID MUIR: ... let me talk about your words ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: We should've kept -- excuse me. We should've taken the oil. And if we took the oil you wouldn't have ISIS. And we would have had wealth. We have spent right now $6 trillion in the Middle East. And our country is falling apart. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Our roads -- excuse me. Our roads, our bridges, our schools, it's falling apart. We have spent as of one month ago $6 trillion in the Middle East. And in our country we can't afford to build a school in Brooklyn or we can't afford to build a school in Los Angeles. And we can't afford to fix up our inner cities. We can't afford to do anything. Look, it's time. It's been our longest war. We've been in there for 15, 16 years. Nobody even knows what the date is because they don't really know when did we start. But it's time. It's time. DAVID MUIR: What got my attention, Mr. President, was when you said, ""Maybe we'll have another chance."" PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, don't let it get your attention too much because we'll see what happens. I mean, we're gonna see what happens. You know, I told you and I told everybody else that wants to talk when it comes to the military I don't wanna discuss things. I wanna let -- I wanna let the action take place before the talk takes place. I watched in Mosul when a number of months ago generals and politicians would get up and say, ""We're going into Mosul in four months."" Then they'd say, ""We're going in in three months, two months, one month. We're going in next week."" Okay, and I kept saying to myself, ""Gee, why do they have to keep talking about going in?"" All right, so now they go in and it is tough because they're giving the enemy all this time to prepare. I don't wanna do a lot of talking on the military. I wanna talk after it's finished, not before it starts. DAVID MUIR: Let me ask you, Mr. President, about another promise involving Obamacare to repeal it. And you told The Washington Post that your plan to replace Obamacare will include insurance for everybody. That sounds an awful lot like universal coverage. PRESIDENT TRUMP: It's going to be -- what my plan is is that I wanna take care of everybody. I'm not gonna leave the lower 20 percent that can't afford insurance. Just so you understand people talk about Obamacare. And I told the Republicans this, the best thing we could do is nothing for two years, let it explode. And then we'll go in and we'll do a new plan and -- and the Democrats will vote for it. Believe me. Because this year you'll have 150 percent increases. Last year in Arizona 116 perecent increase, Minnesota 60 some-odd percent increase. And I told them, except for one problem, I wanna get it fixed. The best thing I could do as the leader of this country-- but as wanting to get something approved with support of the Democrats, if I didn't do anything for two years they'd be begging me to do something. But I don't wanna do that. So just so you unders-- Obamacare is a disaster. It's too expensive. It's horrible health care. It doesn't cover what you have to cover. It's a disaster. You know it and I know it. And I said to the Republican folks-- and they're terrific folks, Mitch and Paul Ryan, I said, ""Look, if you go fast -- and I'm okay in doing it because it's the right thing to do. We wanna get good coverage at much less cost."" I said, ""If you go fast we then own Obamacare. They're gonna put it on us. And Obamacare is a disaster waiting to explode. If you sit back and let it explode it's gonna be much easier."" That's the thing to do. But the right thing to do is to get something done now. DAVID MUIR: But you ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: So I wanna make sure that nobody's dying on the streets when I'm president. Nobody's gonna be dying on the streets. We will unleash something that's gonna be terrific. And remember this, before Obamacare you had a lot of people that were very, very happy with their health care. And now those people in many cases don't even have health care. They don't even have anything that's acceptable to them. Remember this, keep your doctor, keep your plan, 100 percent. Remember the $5 billion website? Remember the website fiasco. I mean, you do admit that I think, right? The website fiasco. Obamacare is a disaster. We are going to come up with a new plan ideally not an amended plan because right now if you look at the pages they're this high. We're gonna come up with a new plan that's going to be better health care for more people at a lesser cost. DAVID MUIR: Last question because I know you're gonna show me around the White House. Last question on this. You've seen the estimate that 18 million Americans could lose their health insurance if Obamacare is repealed and there is no replacement. Can you assure those Americans watching this right now that they will not lose their health insurance or end up with anything less? PRESIDENT TRUMP: So nobody ever deducts all the people that have already lost their health insurance that liked it. You had millions of people that liked their health insurance and their health care and their doctor and where they went. You had millions of people that now aren't insured anymore. DAVID MUIR: I'm just asking about the people ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: No, no. DAVID MUIR: ... who are nervous and watching ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: We ... DAVID MUIR: ... you for reassurance. PRESIDENT TRUMP: ... here's what I can assure you, we are going to have a better plan, much better health care, much better service treatment, a plan where you can have access to the doctor that you want and the plan that you want. We're gonna have a much better health care plan at much less money. And remember Obamacare is ready to explode. And you interviewed me a couple of years ago. I said '17 -- right now, this year, ""'17 is going to be a disaster."" I'm very good at this stuff. ""'17 is going to be a disaster cost-wise for Obamacare. It's going to explode in '17."" And why not? Obama's a smart guy. So let it all come do because that's what's happening. It's all coming do in '17. We're gonna have an explosion. And to do it right, sit back, let it explode and let the Democrats come begging us to help them because it's on them. But I don't wanna do that. I wanna give great health care at a much lower cost. DAVID MUIR: So, no one who has this health insurance through Obamacare will lose it or end up ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: You know, when you ... DAVID MUIR: ... with anything less? PRESIDENT TRUMP: ... say no one I think no one. Ideally, in the real world, you’re talking about millions of people. Will no one. And then, you know, knowing ABC, you'll have this one person on television saying how they were hurt. Okay. We want no one. We want the answer to be no one. But I will say millions of people will be happy. Right now you have millions and millions and millions of people that are unhappy. It's too expensive and it's no good. And the governor of Minnesota who unfortunately had a very, very sad incident yesterday 'cause he's a very nice guy but -- a couple of months ago he said that the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. He's a staunch Democrat. Very strong Democrat. He said it's no longer affordable. He made that statement. And Bill Clinton on the campaign trail -- and he probably had a bad night that night when he went home -- but he said, ""Obamacare is crazy. It's crazy."" And you know what, they were both right. DAVID MUIR: Mr. President, thank you. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you very much. Appreciate it."	1.0

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.WOLF BLITZER, HOST: We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer reporting from St. Paul, Minnesota. We're here at the Xcel Energy Center, where the Republicans are scheduled, and repeat scheduled, to open their national convention here tomorrow. But so much is up in the air right now because of Hurricane Gustav. It's a monster storm, and it's approaching the U.S. Gulf Coast, including New Orleans, this only three years after Hurricane Katrina. And Republicans, including the president of the United States and the vice president of the United States, both of whom were scheduled to come here tomorrow, Monday, to address this Republican gathering, all of that remains unclear right now. what the Republicans are going to do because of Hurricane Gustav.We have reporters all over the Gulf Coast right now monitoring what's going on. We're also standing by for remarks from Michael Chertoff, the secretary of homeland secretary. He's over at Andrews Air Force base just outside Washington in Maryland. You see that small plane with the insignia ""United States of America"" on it. That plane will carry him down to the Gulf Coast to be on top of what's going on.So many people remember the enormous blunders three years ago in advance of Hurricane Katrina. They are desperately trying right now to avoid similar blunders right now.We're going to get the latest update from our Severe Weather Center. Reynolds Wolf is standing by for that. Also, Sean Callebs. He's on the road right now. He's actually driving north of New Orleans towards Baton Rouge. Sean Callebs is in a vehicle, and we want to show our viewers some of that -- some of the lines, some of the mass evacuation that is going on, and we're going to go to Sean Callebs momentarily.But Reynolds Wolf, let me get an update first on what exactly is the status of Gustav, where is it right now, and where is it heading?REYNOLDS WOLF, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Right now, Wolf, the center of the storm is about 466 miles from New Orleans. Just to give our viewers at home an idea of how far away that is, that's roughly the distance of New York -- from New York to Cleveland, Ohio.The storm is getting closer as we speak. It was weakening a little bit over the last hour. Now it appears that the back side of the north half of the storm is beginning to fill in. It is getting stronger. Winds of 120 miles per hour, gusting to 145. It is still a major, major hurricane, and the latest path that we have, Wolf, from the National Hurricane Center shows the storm continuing that northwestern trajectory, roughly around, say, 15, 16 miles per hour. And the storm expected to make its way into the north central Gulf as we get to early Monday morning. Winds of 145 miles per hour.BLITZER: Over at Andrews Air Force base. Stand by.SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY MICHAEL CHERTOFF: ... somewhere between Vermilion Bay and New Orleans in Louisiana. Again, it's possible this will change, but this is where most of the prediction seems to be centered.The storm is moving a little more quickly than we were seeing late yesterday, which means it will arrive within certainly 24 hours in terms of tropical storm winds. At the same time, that may benefit us a little bit by minimizing the strengthening.We're still looking, however, at what may be a low Category 4 or a high Category 3 storm.And, again, you know, as with all storms, these can be tricky. These can change.That means that we basically have the rest of Sunday to complete the evacuation of the coast of Louisiana, as well as evacuation activities in Texas and Mississippi.I spoke to the president early this morning at some length about the state of preparations. He's fully committed to throwing all of the assets of the federal government into this fight.I was over at the FEMA headquarters talking to our DOD partners, General Renuart of Northcom, as well as our state partners in Louisiana. The main evacuation is going well. We are concerned because a number of the hospitals that originally planned to shelter in place have now decided they are going to actually try to evacuate their critically ill and medical needs patients. As a consequence, we've had to increase the tempo of our air flights into New Orleans in order to make sure that we can accommodate the flow. We're going to be watching this very carefully today.I spoke to my counterpart in Canada, Stockwell Day. The Canadians have released to us a number of aircraft that we are also going to be using to evacuate these special medical needs people. So this is going to be probably the most important challenge we're going to be addressing during the course of the next 12 hours.Again, I want to warn people that notwithstanding the predictions, the storm can still change, and, therefore, I would not have let people drop their guard in Mississippi or in parts of Texas simply because it looks like the main hurricane is going to be impacting in New Orleans.Finally, remember, once the hurricane makes landfall, it continues to be a dangerous weather event. The prediction is it will move northwest across Louisiana into east Texas. There's going to be a lot of rainfall. That means there can be localized flooding. And so we're going to have to be following this carefully over the next several days.So with that, I'll take some questions.QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, will you be staying in the region during the storm to ride it out?CHERTOFF: I will.QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)CHERTOFF: Well, I've actually lived through Katrina and any number of disasters over the last three and a half years, so I think I'm well trained and well prepared. I'm well supported in terms of my ability to communicate back to the president and back to Washington, so I'm comfortable that I'm not going to lose touch. And so I'm not worried about my own safety. QUESTION: Can you speak to the situation with evacuations? (inaudible) available for New Orleaneans, were you aware of any issues with that?CHERTOFF: There was an issue where some of the contract buses apparently did not make their appearance. This is probably the case with almost any emergency, which is the plan -- as soon as you make contact with the enemy, the plan starts to suffer some alteration.The good news here is that really good work with the state authorities allowed us to backfill on the buses, using school buses and other transportation. So the report I got this morning is that that was moving well.But, again, we have backup capabilities, particularly military capabilities, should we need them.I do want to emphasize the window is closing. Once you get tropical storm winds, there's no more evacuation.I've also heard reports that some people are still determined to try to ride the storm out in the coast. That strikes me as exceptionally foolish. I think the local authorities have made it very clear, and I saw them doing it this morning, that the National Guard will protect people's property. People should heed the instructions to evacuate and protect their own lives.So, you know, we're prepared for the fact that we may have to improvise today if various elements of what we're relying upon don't live up to expectation. We've got some margin for doing that, but this is something that we're literally -- we've been working on overnight and we'll be working on all during the rest of the day, and I expect to get down to the evacuation areas myself later today to make sure that everybody is fully focused on this.QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE). How likely is it that we can avoid the problems that Katrina posed?CHERTOFF: Well, I think there's no question that we're doing much better than we did in Katrina. If you look at the evacuation, it's begun a whole 24 to 36 hours earlier than Katrina. The preparations for people with medical needs, people without automobiles, I think we've already seen the benefit of that.Every storm is different. This storm is going to come in differently than Katrina did. It's going to move to the west of New Orleans. That's actually bad news, because the most powerful part of the storm is actually the right side of the storm. So it's going to be in some ways more challenging than Katrina, because there's going to be a broader range of people who have to evacuate.But, having worked over the last several days with the state and local authorities, I think they are well focused and well integrated with what we are doing.Nevertheless, as I say, it's going to be a very, very tough event. Depending on how strong the storm is, we're going to see a different level of impact with respect to New Orleans itself and some of the coastal communities. If we wind up lucky and it's a Category 3, then I anticipate we're going to get less damage than a Category 4. We may not know what we're going to have at landfall for, you know, some period of time, because, again, there's some weather activity at high altitude that may yet affect the way in which the storm comes in.So we're prepared for the worst. We're also prepared, frankly, to improvise, and we've got a plan B. What we need is the maximum level of cooperation from the individual public.UNKNOWN: Final question, and then we've got to get going.QUESTION: Secretary, during Katrina, (inaudible). Do you believe that you have that now, during (ph) and after?CHERTOFF: Yes, I have to say we are -- we do have a unified command and control. We are embedded with the state. The state is embedded with us. There's been no disconnect in terms of the ability to work together.Like with any other emergency, you know, the people on the ground are the people who are going to have to accurately report what's happening.CHERTOFF: That's been going on so far.When we have hitches -- and we've had some hitches -- we've been able to recover and adapt. And that's really, over the next 48 hours, what the name of the game is.It's going to be to adapt to unforeseen emerging circumstances. That's what an emergency is. And that's what I'm going to go down to make sure we can do.So I'm looking forward to getting down there so we can get our hands on the situation.QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) CHERTOFF: Again, the levees are stronger than Katrina. I've seen the barrier at the 17th Street Canal. That is an effective barrier. However, if you get a Category 4 storm, there is a real likelihood of getting some overtopping.Additionally, rain is a big factor here. Even if there's no overtopping of the levees, rain will likely cause some flooding in New Orleans, so that's why evacuation becomes critical.And, again, we -- you know, we've got to hope the storm diminishes a little bit, but we have to be prepared for the worst.Thanks very much. We'll see you down there.BLITZER: There he is, Michael Chertoff. He's about to get on that plane, fly off to the Gulf Coast. He says he wants to be personally in charge of what's going on. All of us, of course, recalling the disaster leading up to Hurricane Katrina almost exactly three years ago.Let's go to the head of FEMA right now. David Paulison is joining us from FEMA headquarters.Mr. Paulison, thanks very much for coming in. Are you guys ready this time?FEMA DIRECTOR DAVID PAULISON: We have been ready. We've been on the ground. You heard Secretary Chertoff talk about what we're doing. We pre-positioned buses, ambulances. We have trains on the ground that are moving people out. We have a tremendous amount of aircraft and the Department of Defense flying people out. All of these things were put in place prior to the storm as opposed to Katrina that came in after the storm. So, yes, we're all ready.Do we have challenges? No question about it. We've got several hospitals that we're going to shelter in place, and now they've asked to be evacuated, so we're working through that. We've worked all night long to make sure that we're flying more aircraft in. Canada is lending us aircraft to make sure we have enough planes to get people out of there, get them out of harm's way.BLITZER: The last time we all remember the lack of communications. The left hand of the U.S. government couldn't speak to the right hand of the U.S. government. There was no real coordination between federal, state, and local authorities. The radio frequencies weren't -- weren't compatible.Has all that been repaired? Can you assure the American people right now that there is this level of cooperation, you, the state, and local authorities?PAULISON: Wolf, the -- your observation is absolutely correct. During Katrina, the level of communication -- not the radio communication, per se, but just being able to talk to each other, being on the same page -- simply did not happen in Katrina. We have put in place our National Incident Management System. We'll use the unified command. Every afternoon at noontime, we have video conferences where everybody is on board.We have the states on there. We have all the Department of Defenses on there. All the federal agencies that are having a part of this are a part of that videoconference. And for an hour-and-a-half, we go through every issue to make sure everybody understands what it is.I was down there the day before yesterday with Secretary Chertoff. The state and the local communities are in sync with each other that we did not see during Katrina. The states are talking to each other.I was just watching the contraflow and how well that's going. When Louisiana asked with contraflow where they have to work with Mississippi and Texas, that is happening. The governors are talking to each other.It's the best piece of communication that I've seen in a long, long time, and it's working very well.BLITZER: There was an editorial Friday in the New York Times. I'll read this -- this section from it. ""Three years after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast, residents there are nervously watching the progress of Tropical Storm, threatening to be Hurricane Gustav."" It's now a Category 3 or 4.""No less nerve-racking is the knowledge that federal emergency planners have failed to come up with a new strategy for providing housing to disaster victims.""Is the New York Times right in their editorial?PAULISON: No, they're not. We have a national strategy housing plan that came out for '08. Our national housing strategy we just released last month. We have plans in place to make sure we can take care of people.There is -- you know, we're not going to use travel trailers, obviously, but we have mobile homes, we have Katrina cottages, we have Mississippi cottages, we have apartments, we have hotels and motels. There's a whole process that we're going to use to make sure people have a place to stay. We're not going to repeat the same mistakes we did in Katrina.There's -- it's a different agency, Wolf. It really is, a different philosophy of being proactive and not reactive, working as partners with the state, instead of working independently, an entirely different type of system.Again, are we going to have our challenges? No question about it. This is a very, very dangerous storm.So right now, we're focused on evacuations, working with the state, working with the local communities to make sure that everyone has an opportunity to evacuate. We don't want anyone -- anyone to stay in the city and try to ride the storm out. We want them to get out and move to a safe place.BLITZER: And one final question, Administrator Paulison. Is it your sense right now that Gustav could be actually worse, more devastating than Katrina?PAULISON: That's a possibility. Yesterday, it briefly went to a Category 5, then back down to a Category 4. This morning, thank goodness, it's a Category 3. But it has to go across the rest of the gulf.If it comes in at a different angle, it will test parts of the levee that were not tested during Katrina. The Corps has done a yeoman's job of rebuilding the levees, making them higher and stronger, but there are still a lot of vulnerabilities.This could be a -- this could be a much worse storm. Hopefully, it won't be, but the possibilities are definitely there.BLITZER: And New Orleans is -- based on everything you know right now, right sort of in the bull's eye?PAULISON: That's the way it appears to be right now. Now, you know, with the hurricanes, after it came off of Cuba, it's going to be difficult to predict for a few hours exactly where it's going to go.We've been getting reports from the hurricane center 150 miles one way or the other, but right now it looks like it's heading right towards New Orleans or just to the west of New Orleans. BLITZER: FEMA Administrator David Paulison, Mr. Paulison, good luck to you. Good luck to all the men and women you command. We're all counting on you, as you know.PAULISON: Thank you, Wolf, I appreciate it. Appreciate your support.BLITZER: Thank you very much.And as you can see, this is a monster storm with very, very dangerous ramifications.I want to go back to Reynolds Wolf at the CNN Severe Weather Center.Reynolds, I interrupted you before when we went to Michael Chertoff, the secretary of homeland security, who was at Andrews Air Force Base getting ready to fly down to the Gulf Coast.All right, walk us through this process, where it is right now, where it's heading. And you just heard the FEMA administrator say New Orleans could be right in the bull's eye.WOLF: Absolutely. Wolf, one thing we've got to remember though, too, is, when Katrina made landfall, you'll remember that Katrina didn't even make a direct hit on New Orleans. In fact, it passed to the east, which meant that, if it passes to the east, it means that New Orleans was affected by the western half of the storm, the weakest part of the storm.The way the path plays out -- I want you to follow this -- go from now into tomorrow morning, where it is expected to strengthen back up to a Category 4 storm with winds of 145 miles per hour. And then the forecast of the National Hurricane Center brings the storm on the eastern side. The eastern side of the storm is what will be affecting parts of New Orleans.So New Orleans could be affected by the strongest part, the heaviest rainfall, the biggest storm surge, the strongest winds, on that side is -- and I'm thinking that the eye will make landfall about 60 to 70 miles to the southwest of New Orleans sometime tomorrow afternoon between the hours of, say, 1 o'clock and 3 o'clock local time.And because it's going to be that side, the right-hand side, which Secretary Chertoff was talking about, that does mean that New Orleans will be hit by the strongest part of the storm.Still, you look at that cone of probability, of uncertainty, if you will, there's a chance the storm could veer off a little bit more to the east, perhaps a bit to the west, but, still, a storm of this size, hundreds of miles wide, there's no question that New Orleans is going to be affected.BLITZER: And when you say it could still veer off a little bit, that's as a result of the water temperatures, the winds as it goes across the Gulf Coast, is that right?WOLF: Actually, what we have is we have an area of high pressure that is setting up over the Ohio Valley. And it's that area of high pressure, Wolf, that moves in a clockwise rotation. And actually the upper level winds can steer -- we refer to them as steering currents -- can actually push this storm a little bit farther off to the west.If they weaken a little bit, well, the storm tends to turn a little bit more to the east. So it all depends a lot on those upper- level winds.Now, you were talking about water temperatures. Water temperatures are the big thing that really can strengthen this storm.In fact, just to the south -- actually, to the north of Cuba at this time, we have an area that we refer to as the gulf loop current, where you have water that comes in right between the Yucatan Channel to the northwest of Cuba and then back into the Strait of Florida, this is a -- really, really warm water, water temperatures anywhere from, say, the mid- to upper 80s.And that's like high-octane fuel for these storms. And that's what really could intensify this storm, cause it to gain in strength to a Category 4, perhaps even a Category 5 storm before all is said and done. BLITZER: Well, we're praying for everyone affected by this.Reynolds, stand by. I know you're getting constant updates. We're going to come back to you.We're standing by to speak to the Florida governor, Charlie Crist. He certainly knows a great deal about hurricanes. It looks like Florida is going to be spared this time, but there's another hurricane potentially out there called Hanna. We're going to talk to Charlie Crist, the governor of Florida, in a moment.BLITZER: Also, this Republican Convention, you see it here, I'm here at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul. Everything is up in the air right now based on what's happening along the Gulf Coast. We'll update you on what we know right after this. You're watching a special LATE EDITION. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: Welcome back to our special LATE EDITION. I'm Wolf Blitzer reporting. We're here on the floor at the Republican National Convention. It's supposed to get started tomorrow, but everything right now is up in the air. They are trying to reconsider what to do as Hurricane Gustav moves towards the Gulf Coast with New Orleans right in the center of it, could be in the bull's eye.Right now we just heard from the FEMA administrator, David Paulison, and from the secretary of homeland secretary, Michael Chertoff. The governor of Florida, Charlie Crist, is joining us now from St. Petersburg.Governor, God knows you and all Floridians have had your wealth of experience, share of experience on hurricanes. Correct me if I'm wrong, Florida at least as far as Gustav is concerned, has been spared, is that right?GOV. CHARLIE CRIST, R-FLA.: Well, it looks better for us now than it did, say, yesterday. But we're still concerned in the panhandle about rip currents and things of that nature. We also had some bands that came through the Fort Myers area this morning and had some tornado warnings in the Florida Keys.So we're concerned about it. We're concerned for our neighbors too. And we want to make sure that anything that Florida can do to help our friends out in Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, we stand at the ready to do so.And I've talked to my fellow governors about that fact and communicated with our director of emergency management, Craig Fugate, this morning, to reach out and make sure they know that we're here to help and anything that we can do to be of assistance, that's exactly what we want to do.BLITZER: Can you believe, Governor, that this is virtually the same -- this is the third anniversary of Katrina and that New Orleans could be hit with a devastating Category 3 or Category 4 or maybe even a Category 5 hurricane right now. Can you believe that? CRIST: No, Wolf, it's hard to believe, it really is. But, you know, things happen, and you just have to be prepared and I think that's the watchword. And I've got to tell you, Governor Jindal is doing a great job. I just listened to your interview with Secretary Chertoff and Director Paulison with FEMA.I've been in communication with them this week as well and I couldn't be more pleased for the people of Louisiana and the entire Gulf Coast for the response from our federal government, the working and coordinated effort between the governors of the Gulf states.It is inspiring to see. People are prepared and it's a much different situation than three years ago, and that's a good thing for the people.BLITZER: And as you know, Governor, there's another storm brewing in the Caribbean right now, in the Atlantic, Hanna, right now, and there's some projections showing that Florida could be hit. What do we know about Hanna?CRIST: Well, we know that we're concerned about it, there's no question there. Again, I was talking to our meteorologists this morning, and they told me that some of the models really have sort of blown up, and we're not sure exactly where it will go over the next three or four days, but certainly Florida could be in its sights.It depends on this high weather stuff and the high pressure that you get from these steering currents that they talk about so much in the weather rooms. And so we're watching and monitoring that as well. It's like we have one on our left and one on our right and we're sort of in the middle of the eye of it.And we want to do everything we can to monitor the situation, to be vigilant, to first and foremost, put the people of Florida and our Gulf State neighbors and their health, safety, and welfare at the forefront.BLITZER: Are you going to be able to come out here to St. Paul and participate in this Republican Convention?CRIST: Well, it's looking less likely. It all depends on what happens with these storms. I mean, you know, first things first, and that is protect the people of my state and make sure that we're doing everything we can to support them, give them care and comfort and be there for them.We just had Tropical Storm Fay that came through and hit Florida an unprecedented four times. Regrettably, 14 of my fellow Floridians lost their lives as a result of that. So first and foremost, we need to be here for the people, and that's what I'm going to do.BLITZER: Gloria Borger is here, our senior political analyst, Governor. She has a question she wants to ask you.CRIST: Good morning, Gloria. GLORIA BORGER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Governor, what strikes you -- good morning. What strikes you as the most different between now and three years ago when Katrina struck?CRIST: I think it's the level of preparation and the fact that so many people have, you know, been on the front side of this rather than the back side, really addressing the needs of the people in terms of making sure they get out, that there is safe passage in order to get north in Louisiana, that all the roadways are headed in the same direction.It's a tremendous, well-coordinated, well-planned effort. You know, we learned from our past mistakes in life, and clearly that's what has happened here. The Katrina example is not a good one and a dark cloud over America at that time.But you learn from those experiences, you move forward and from those kinds of mistakes of the past you get better. And the federal government, the state governments, and the local responders, God bless them, are doing great and coordinating incredibly well, and that's really a benefit to the people and their safety and their security.BLITZER: Governor Crist, thanks very much for joining us. Good luck to everyone in Florida, not only as far as Gustav is concerned, but Hanna, which is brewing out in the Atlantic right now. We'll stay in close touch with you.CRIST: Thank you, Wolf. Thank you, Gloria.BLITZER: And there are new developments happening here in St. Paul, Minnesota, right now. What's going to happen to this Republican Convention? Our John King has been doing some digging. He's standing by, he's here with us. We'll take a quick break. Much more of our coverage right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: Welcome back. We're here on the floor of the Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minnesota, but everything is up in the air right now. We don't know if this convention will take place, whether it will be abbreviated or what's going on. But John King is here, and you've been doing some reporting. What are you hearing from the organizers?JOHN KING, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Number one, we will get an official announcement sometime early this afternoon. They are having another set of meetings today. They had meetings late into the night last night.We know already, even though the White House says the president is unlikely to come, we're told he's not coming. They are just saying that for now...BLITZER: He was supposed to speak Monday night, and the vice president, Dick Cheney, was supposed to be here Monday as well.KING: Unless the storm suddenly does an unexpected u-turn, which we all know won't happen, unfortunately, the president will not be here. He'll focus on hurricane preparations. I'm told that everything is on the table, including the possibility of delaying the start tomorrow, or, increasingly more likely, is trying to pack the convention into one or two days before the hurricane makes landfall or before the damage is most severe.They have to nominate John McCain. The party has to go through a process to officially nominate him, and they are trying to figure out how do they do that most efficiently and not have a big party going on during the hurricane.And this is at Senator McCain's insistence. He's down in the Gulf Coast area today. He's flying there right now. He's spoken in the last 24 hours to everybody from Mike Chertoff, the homeland security secretary, to all those Gulf state governors, including Governor Crist, who you just had on; Haley Barbour of Mississippi; Bobby Jindal in Louisiana. And he says, let's do what we need to do, but let's not, A, have a political celebration and B, do anything that disrupts or takes resources away.So we'll get an official announcement later this afternoon, but we're guaranteed very substantial changes to the planned program. BLITZER: Because our meteorologist, Reynolds Wolf, says this hurricane could hit New Orleans between 1:00 and 3:00 p.m. Central Time tomorrow, Monday afternoon.KING: Right, and that's the hard part. They want to wait -- that's one of the key elements, what is the exact timing. Can they get the business done before it makes landfall, or get it done at least as fast as possible? Or should they delay and wait until after, and give it a couple of days to see what happens? But if they do that and it is a severe and significant storm, then the country is in the middle of a recovery effort, possibly a rescue effort. So this is the very -- this has never happened before to a major political party, so they are making very difficult decisions, and the top McCain campaign command is here, and Senator McCain is obviously keeping in touch as he travels to the region.BLITZER: Rick Davis, the campaign manager, is already here in St. Paul and is meeting with organizers, and we expect some word later this afternoon, is that right?KING: Yes, we will.BLITZER: Alex Castellanos, you're a Republican strategist. What should the Republicans do about this convention, given the fact that Hurricane Gustav is a Category 4 monster with New Orleans, we just heard from the FEMA administrator and from Michael Chertoff, New Orleans, bull's eye. Could be right in the middle of it?ALEX CASTELLANOS, GOP STRATEGIST: I think most people here, I talked to the delegates and they are all very concerned that this is certainly not a time for a bunch of political hoopla. The delegates here are saying, look, what can we do to help? Can we turn this into an opportunity to do something and have a positive impact on this?The experience last time is very clear, that when you have something like this happen, this is a time for Americans to come together and put politics at the back of the line, and that's the message that Republicans want to send out of this convention.BLITZER: Is that what you're hearing, Gloria?BORGER: Talk about turning this into a big fund-raiser for social service organizations. It's not only a question of scheduling and whether you truncate the convention, but it's a question of tone, as I think is what Alex is talking about.You can't be out there attacking your political opponent while people's lives are threatened in this country, and so everyone here is very, very well aware of that, Wolf. So, you know, it will be condensed, but it will be different. And maybe they will raise money for the Red Cross and maybe they will start raising money for all sorts of social service organizations. They will do whatever they can, because they realize that this is something that would turn the American public off, quite frankly.BLITZER: Right. I can only imagine what the Louisiana delegation is going through right now, wondering should they come, should they not come, should they be with their loved ones?I want to bring in Donna Brazile, our Democratic strategist. Donna, you're in Washington right now, but all of our viewers know you're from Louisiana and you have a lot of family members down there. What's their status?DONNA BRAZILE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, thank you, Wolf, first of all. They got out this time. Mayor Nagin made it very clear that people should evacuate, and as of 2:00 a.m. this morning, my last sibling got out. And she made it to Memphis about an hour ago. I have family now scattered in five states. But, Wolf, this is for those of us who remember Katrina three years ago, this time they heeded the warnings. They left.BLITZER: And what are you hearing about other friends and acquaintances, the overall situation? Is it really better this time? Because we hear it's better that they learn the lessons of Katrina, and people are doing a better job getting out of the whole Gulf Coast area that could be hit, especially in the New Orleans area, which is so vulnerable, as all of our viewers know. Are you satisfied with what you're hearing, Donna?BRAZILE: Yes, Wolf. You know, my major concern, outside of my family, of course, is the people in New Orleans. There are so many people that cannot afford to get out of harm's way. And Mayor Nagin, the state government, the federal government, all worked together to coordinate buses. There were buses in practically all of the important neighborhoods of the low-lying areas -- Algiers, even across the river. People were able to get there, get on those buses. They are heading to Shreveport, they are heading to points north.The mayor also has called in emergency workers to evacuate some of the hospitals. You've covered a lot of this, but I just want to let you know personally, just talking to people -- I served on the Louisiana Recovery Authority. This time around, people feel that the government, the federal government, the state government and the local government, everyone is working together, and people have the essential information to get out there. They know the routes to take. The buses are there. They are giving them supplies, and we're also able to get the pets out this time as well.BLITZER: What do you think, Donna, the Republicans should do right now about their convention? It's supposed to begin tomorrow. It's supposed to go on until Thursday night, but it potentially is not going to happen, or at least there will be a truncated version of the convention.BRAZILE: Well, as you well know, there are certain things that must take place procedurally, but I think at some point, they should suspend the rules, go ahead and nominate John McCain and his running mate, the governor of Alaska, and just really take this moment to help those Americans who are fleeing the entire Gulf Coast, and to assist them in their recovery efforts. Because, as you well know, once that storm hits, emergency supplies will have to be sent into the region to help those who may have been stranded, as well as to help those who will have to figure out how to get back home and rebuild their lives again.BLITZER: And let me ask Alex, quickly, do you agree?CASTELLANOS: Yes, absolutely. And Donna made a good point, and that is there is business that does have to be taken care of.BLITZER: (inaudible) nominate, you have to nominate a candidate.CASTELLANOS: If we do not take care of that business, John McCain doesn't get on the ballot in a lot of states. There is no presidential election.BLITZER: But they can do all that in half an hour, or an hour if they want.CASTELLANOS: I don't know how long it takes, but it certainly doesn't take four days.BLITZER: Yes.BORGER: You know, Wolf, there is particular sensibility on the Republican side about this issue, because George W. Bush was blamed for failures in the rescue efforts in Hurricane Katrina. John McCain has made it a point to say that he would have managed that differently. And so every Republican I talked to here understands that particularly for the Republican Party, they have got to have the right tone and they have got to do it right this time.BLITZER: All right, guys, I want everybody to stand by, because we have a lot more. We're watching Hurricane Gustav. It's moving, it's moving towards New Orleans and the Gulf Coast right now. There's enormous danger, not only in Louisiana but potentially Mississippi and Texas. We're watching what's going on.BLITZER: We'll give you a complete update.We're also here at the convention, the Republican Convention. We don't know if there will be a convention, how long of a convention. As soon as we know what's going on, we'll share it with you. This is a special LATE EDITION and we'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: Welcome back to the floor of the Republican National Convention. I'm Wolf Blitzer. This is a special LATE EDITION. We're watching what's happening here at the Republican Convention, all the planning that has been going on for weeks and months up in the air right now because of Hurricane Gustav, it's a Category 4 monster right now moving right towards the Louisiana coast, including New Orleans.We have a new forecast. They are about to release a new forecast very, very soon at the top of the hour. Stand by. We'll see if there has been any changes in intensity or direction. We'll bring you that momentarily.But I want to go to the floor of the convention right now. CNN's Howard Kurtz of our ""RELIABLE SOURCES"" is standing by with three really plugged-in reporters who can give us a good sense of what they know about this convention and the impact it's facing as a result of Gustav -- Howie.HOWARD KURTZ, HOST, ""RELIABLE SOURCES"": Thanks, Wolf. Well, all the reporters have dragged themselves here from Denver but not before being rocked by McCain's choice of Sarah Palin to be his running mate. So will McCain and Palin get the same kind of coverage here in St. Paul that Barack Obama and Joe Biden did at the Democratic Convention?Joining me now is Dana Milbank, Washington Post columnist and CNN contributor; Lynn Sweet, Washington bureau chief of The Chicago Sun- Times; and Roger Simon, chief political columnist for politico.com. We'll get to the hurricane in just a minute.But, Dana, seconds after Palin's name leaked, the TV pundits, the anchors were saying, is she qualified to be a heartbeat from the presidency? Is she a token woman? How fair was that?DANA MILBANK, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Of course she's qualified, she was a former Miss Wasilla. But, look, it took everybody by surprise, the announcement made us collectively in the media look like a bunch of fools because we were authoritatively proclaiming the short list and she wasn't actually on it.So there were complaints of sort of soft sexism actually from the right and the left. But in general I think she got a pretty good splash out of it there.KURTZ: Your publication Politico said this was a desperate move by John McCain. Isn't it a tad early for that judgment?ROGER SIMON, CHIEF POLITICAL COLUMNIST, POLITICO: Yes, what has upset the media is that we realize we're no longer John McCain's base. He made this decision for another base, the social conservatives in the Republican Party and we're sort of shocked and dismayed by that.But, you know, her choice makes some sense on a number of levels.KURTZ: On the coverage of this woman who most of America doesn't know, Lynn Sweet, she has been described as an ex-beauty queen, Dana has already taken that shot, a woman who goes ice fishing and likes to eat mooseburgers.There seems to be a little bit of a subtle mockery here that some might say is sexist.LYNN SWEET, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, THE CHICAGO SUN-TIMES: Actually, I think quite the opposite right now because they have gotten out a fuller resume. It is their job to tell the whole story. She's also an athlete, a mayor, government official, mother of five, and that is just her biography.This is an election where story line means a lot. It has taken Obama partly to where he is today. I...KURTZ: But Politico also asks the question, how will she balance raising her five kids with the demands of a national campaign or being in the White House, a question that would never be asked of a man?SWEET: And right. And people that start the coverage like that I think are looking at it through a lens that is unfair right and could be called sexist. I think that will go away. Part of this happens when the media is surprised, Howie. And the usual thing that...KURTZ: We're supposed to be professionals. Who cares if we're surprised. So we got it wrong.SWEET: Well, I think...KURTZ: It wasn't Romney. It wasn't Pawlenty.SWEET: And then that hurts the mainstream press because if there's one thing left in this very competitive reporting atmosphere, is that the blogosphere will say, well, what good are we if we couldn't even figure this out ahead of time or game it enough to put her on the media list?SIMON: You know, there's nothing wrong with waiting for reality. I'm not sure it is really our duty to guess 48 hours in advance what we're going to know 48 hours in the future.KURTZ: Well, especially when McCain hadn't quite made up his mind. But does a conservative woman, Dana Milbank, who is fervently opposed to abortion and certain forms of gay rights get different treatment from the media -- some would say the liberal media, than a liberal woman might if Barack Obama had picked a woman or if he had picked Hillary?MILBANK: You know, i do give the blogosphere some credit here because we are getting hammered in the media from both the right, as would you expect it, but also from the left, the same people who were complaining about our treatment of Hillary Clinton, a lot of them are coming out and saying, hey, you're being unfair. So there is a bit of consistency to it.So yes, I think inevitably there's a little bit of that going on, but that's not the dominant theme, I think.KURTZ: How much is the hurricane as it barrels down the Gulf going to draw media attention away from what's happening here in this arena?SIMON: Oh, I think we're going to see a split screen convention where, you know, half the screen or more is going to be Katrina and the other half is going to be here. They are talking about canceling whole days or canceling the nomination itself.I think it's like letting the terrorists win. I think they ought to go ahead with this thing, forget about the balloon drop. The balloons are there but it's a cliche anyway. They can do all sorts of stuff. They can contribute blood here. They can pass the hat for money. They can make serious speeches.But this does serve a legal purpose. They are choosing a nominee for the Republican presidential campaign.KURTZ: And of course, we have to decide how much attention we're going to place on a very important convention here and the introduction of Sarah Palin and all of that. But, on the other hand, a million people have been evacuated from the Gulf.Let's look back briefly at the Democratic Convention. All the things that were in the media about the Hillary revolt, the roll call, the stadium, the Greek columns, none of that seems very important after the convention actually took place. Did we focus on the wrong things?SWEET: Well, I think it was this very situational and for the time it was ephemeral that we were writing about which why we correctly, I think, are moving on. The McCain people counted on the announcement of his vice presidential choice to capture the headlines.And now between this and the hurricane the -- all of the success of the Obama convention will not be what we're focusing on because the story line has moved on, Howie. KURTZ: Barack Obama got rave reviews, some would say, gushing reviews for his big speech at Invesco Field. McCain obviously is not that kind of orator so is there likely to be a real difference in the way the speeches are covered and contrasted by our journalistic colleagues?MILBANK: Likely to be a huge difference. I mean, Bill Maher on Friday night was suggesting that the anchors on another network were ready to have sex with the candidate that night.I think there is going to be a huge disparity in the treatment, but a lot of it has to do with this candidate named Gustav. So a lot will be situational rather than reflecting some sort of a media bias. KURTZ: Leaving the weather -- the extreme weather aside, is it fair for us to go crazy over one candidate who happens to be a great speaker, doesn't necessarily mean he's going to be a great president versus John McCain?MILBANK: Right.SIMON: The bar is lowered for McCain. Everyone knows he is not the speaker that Barack Obama is.And he's had difficult moments. He really needs a TelePrompTer. He doesn't like to read speeches. And when you make him read a speech, he reads it from the podium, and tends to put his head down, and his campaign spends a lot of time working with him on it.All he has to do is be sincere, and warm, and strong, and experienced, and look presidential.KURTZ: And beat the media's expectations. That's the game.SIMON: Which may not be hard.KURTZ: Roger Simon, Lynn Sweet, Dana Milbank, thanks for joining us.Wolf Blitzer, back to you.BLITZER: Howie, thanks very much. Thank the reporters, as well.We're just getting in from the National Hurricane Center an update on where Hurricane Gustav is moving right now, its intensity. Our severe weather expert, Reynolds Wolf, is standing by. We're going to go to him momentarily.Also, Susan Roesgen, she's in New Orleans. She's getting ready, like others are, for this monster storm. Much more of our special coverage right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: Let's go right to Reynolds Wolf.Reynolds, you have an update from the National Hurricane Center on Hurricane Gustav?WOLF: That's right, Wolf. This just in. Winds are still at 120 miles an hour, gusting to 150. It's about 400 miles or so from New Orleans.The latest we have for you, Wolf, is that it has picked up quite a bit of its forward speed, still to the northwest, but at a little bit of a faster clip.Originally, we thought that it was going to make landfall around -- anywhere between 1 o'clock or 3 o'clock local time. Now it appears that, as we get into early Monday morning, winds will be at 135, still a major hurricane, but making landfall around noontime local time.You'll also notice, Wolf, we do anticipate the storm will actually increase to a Category 4 storm shortly before making landfall.Still, New Orleans, right there in that cone of uncertainty, by all sorts of the imagination, will catch the brunt of the storm, in terms of a tremendous amount of rainfall, some strong wind gusts, well in excess of 100 miles per hour, and storm surge that could be in excess of 15 feet, certainly a rough time for the Crescent City.We are going to keep a sharp eye on this, Wolf. And as we get more updates, we're going to pass them on to you.BLITZER: And how would this compare -- very briefly, Reynolds -- with Katrina?WOLF: Katrina, you'll remember, passed a little bit more to the east, which actually, at that time, New Orleans actually caught the weakest part of the storm.The biggest reason why we had the issues with Katrina really had very little to do with just the sheer force of Katrina, but rather just because of the failure of the levees. And you had, of course, the widespread problems in New Orleans.This time, you're going to have more direct contact with this storm in New Orleans. It could be devastating, there's no question.BLITZER: All right. Stand by, Reynolds. We're going to be coming back to you.We're going to go to Susan Roesgen. She's in New Orleans right now. Much more of ""Late Edition"" right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: This is a special ""Late Edition."" I'm Wolf Blitzer.We're here in St. Paul, Minnesota, getting ready for what's supposed to be the Republican National Convention, but everything is up in the air right now because of a monster storm, Hurricane Gustav. It's moving towards the U.S. Gulf Coast.It's a Category 3, Category 4. It could become a Category 5 storm, with New Orleans right in the bull's eye.We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer reporting.Let's get the latest, because only moments ago the National Hurricane Center issued an update. Reynolds Wolf is standing by.Update our viewers on what we know about this storm, Reynolds.WOLF: All right, Wolf. The latest we have is the storm, Hurricane Gustav, now a Category 3 storm, still a major hurricane. We've seen some weakening since the overnight hours. And right now, winds still strong at 120 miles per hour. It's about 400 miles or so just from New Orleans.It is moving to the northwest at 17 miles an hour. That is the biggest change we've seen with the storm since the earlier update. We've seen a little bit of a greater speed in its forward progress as it treks its way to the northwest.And the latest we have from the National Hurricane Center shows the storm continuing on that northwest trajectory, expected to make landfall somewhere to the southwest, I'd say about 60 to 70 miles southwest of New Orleans.Notice this, Wolf, a key thing right here: winds increasing to 135 miles an hour early Monday morning. What they expect is the National Hurricane Center is banking that this storm is going to move into an area of minimal sheer aloft. That's winds high aloft that can tear the storm apart. The structure is very important for the storm to retain its power.The second thing it's going to run into, an area of water temperatures that will be into the mid- to upper 80s. That's like high-octane fuel for these huge powerhouse storms.And we anticipate the storm will make landfall somewhere in that area, again, just at the southwest of New Orleans, sometime around noon tomorrow. It's going to bring anywhere from, say, 13 to 18 feet of storm surge, heavy rainfall, winds well in excess of 100 miles per hour.Then the storm will begin to die out once it moves over central Louisiana. And then notice into Wednesday and into Thursday, it all but pulls -- actually, pulls up stationary, for the most part, dumping quite a bit of rain. Some places in Texas, Louisiana could see well over a foot of rainfall by the middle and the late half of next week.A huge powerhouse, no question, Wolf.BLITZER: Reynolds, show our viewers the projections. There have been various computer projections of where this storm will actually hit, how wide it might be. I want to put that up on the screen for our viewers.WOLF: Absolutely. What we're talking about is -- the layman's term for this would be the spaghetti models. The reason why we call them the spaghetti models is because, plain and simple, they look like lines of spaghetti.You'll see in the map behind me different computer models showing the current location of Gustav. And then you have computer models that show the storm possibly moving up towards Mobile, Alabama, maybe even past Dauphin Island, or maybe even closer to Houston, not far from Texas Bay.Now, there are two models that the National Hurricane Center watches very closely. One is called the GDFL. This other one they watch is one that we call the HWRF.Well, those two models, they look at both of those. Those are the ones that -- they're usually the most reliable models.And then they use their own expertise. And these guys are the very best in the business. And they indicate the storm, or at least they think, that the storm will move its way, as I mentioned, just to the southwest of Louisiana.The thing is, though, Wolf, these storms are very hard, very difficult to follow. The storms -- remember, rotating storms, on a rotating planet, spinning over choppy water. You've got all kinds of winds aloft that can push the storm in a different direction, many variables that can change the storm minute by minute, hour by hour.And it's something you have to watch very carefully, no question.BLITZER: Reynolds, stand by. We're going to be getting back to you.Susie Roesgen is on the scene in New Orleans. But before we go to her, John King is getting some new information -- Susie, stand by for a moment -- new information about this convention and the impact from Hurricane Gustav.KING: White House press secretary Dana Perino, Wolf, just a few moments ago has now officially confirmed that neither the president nor the vice president will come here for the convention.Both President Bush and Vice President Cheney, we are told now, will stay in Washington or perhaps go to places affected by the storm. But because of Hurricane Gustav, they have made the decision now that they will not come.The president and vice president, obviously, were on the program Monday night, the opening night of the convention. The White House says, as of now, First Lady Laura Bush still plans to attend.But as we discussed a bit earlier, they will have an announcement in an hour, maybe two hours from now -- they're in meetings this morning finalizing it -- on dramatic changes to the convention program. And there's a possibility this convention could be delayed or they could even squeeze it down and try to do all the official business in one day or so.They're watching what Reynolds Wolf was just reporting. They're watching the track of the storm, the strength of the storm, before they make the final decisions. And there's so much anguish among the planners, the people who have spent months and years planning this gathering.But they understand, because of the severity of this storm, they can't have a big political party. Exactly the changes we'll know soon, but we're beginning to see the evidence of it now with the official word that neither the president nor the vice president will come. BLITZER: And it's potentially possible they could -- if there is a convention at all, they could address the convention via satellite.KING: They could. The plan for the president, if there is a convention, is to address via satellite. We don't have a backup plan for the vice president just yet.But the theme of this convention was supposed to be service anyway. Now they're making dramatic plans about maybe trying to raise money, maybe trying to -- you know, take a blood drive. What can they do to help the people affected by this storm, as opposed to having a big political party?But, again, the rules require them to nominate John McCain. John McCain -- they have to do the official business. I was just told a few minutes ago they could, in a worst-case scenario, do that in about two hours.BLITZER: And they have to nominate the vice presidential nominee, as well, Sarah Palin, the governor of Alaska.Stand by. We're going to talk about all of this fallout. Former Senator Fred Thompson is here. Gloria is here with us, as well.But I want to go to New Orleans right now. Susie Roesgen is on the scene for us.You've lived there for some time. You no longer live there, but you know this story about as well as anyone.Susie, set the scene for us right now. Is New Orleans evacuated? Have thousands of people already left? Are more leaving right now?SUSAN ROESGEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Oh, absolutely, Wolf, so many more than during Katrina and so much earlier. Many people got out on city buses. They got out on Amtrak trains. The famous city of New Orleans has been taking people out of this city.People who have their own transportation are getting out. I think the city is going to be very empty within the next few hours, except for the hospitals. There are a few hospitals, Wolf -- and I'm in front of one of them, Children's Hospital.Behind me, there are 80 patients, 80 child patients in here, 47 of whom are in critical care units. They're not going anywhere. They might not survive a rushed evacuation.So the doctors and nurses here, many of them, have volunteered to stay behind. They say they've got 70,000 gallons of diesel fuel, enough to power generators here for three weeks. They're ready. They believe that they're going to be safe.They're going to have a contingent of police officers and firemen. There are also other hospitals, a few others around the city, that are going to stay open. Wolf, if they have to get out of here, which could be the case -- you never know -- let me show you what they have over here, something they did not have in Hurricane Katrina. Since then, they have built a second floor helipad, and that's the way they'll get these patients out of here, if they have to.But right now they think they can withstand it. Everybody else in this city, Wolf, gets the message. Get out. Don't try to ride it out.BLITZER: And what about those people who have pets? We remember the thousands, tens of thousands who refused to leave the last time. They didn't want to leave their cats or their dogs behind. What are the -- what are the authorities doing about that situation right now?ROESGEN: Well, you know, Wolf, you'd have to be a pet owner to understand. This is like children to many people. Their pets are like their children.So, yes, the city this time around started evacuating people with their pets first, got them on some of those buses, got them to shelters in the northern part of the state, so the city is trying to do everything to stop any possible excuse, including, Wolf, there was looting last time.People were afraid to leave their homes because they said, ""We don't want our homes to be looted,"" and there was that. This time around, a contingent of 3,000 national guardsmen here protecting the city. So there's no excuse this time. Everyone needs to get out.BLITZER: Susie Roesgen is on the scene for us. We have a whole team of reporters, our intrepid, very courageous reporters who are on the scene. They're getting ready for this. Anderson Cooper is there, as well. We're going to check in with all of them. Stand by for that.And Mayor Ray Nagin of New Orleans, he's getting ready for a news conference to update us on what's happening in that city. This is virtually almost exactly three years since Hurricane Katrina, and now New Orleans once again in the bull's eye of a major hurricane, a hurricane, Category 3 right now, but that could go up to a Category 4 or even a Category 5.We'll continue our coverage of this hurricane, the impact on this Republican convention, and much more. This is a special ""Late Edition."" We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: Welcome back to St. Paul, Minnesota. We're here on the floor of the Republican National Convention. It's supposed to start tomorrow, but everything right now unclear because of Hurricane Gustav. We've just been told, and you heard John King report it here live, that both President Bush and Vice President Cheney, they've decided they are not coming here to St. Paul. They were supposed to address this convention tomorrow, but because of this monster storm that's supposed to hit early afternoon tomorrow and potentially in New Orleans itself, they are not coming, and we're waiting to see what the convention organizers are going to do.We're standing by for a news conference. Mayor Ray Nagin in New Orleans is going to be briefing reporters on his city. On this, the third anniversary of Katrina, New Orleans once again facing another devastating storm. We'll go there live once Mayor Nagin starts speaking, but let's talk a little bit about what all of this means for the Republican National Convention and more.Joining us is Senator Fred Thompson, the former senator from Tennessee, former Republican presidential candidate. Senator, thanks very much for joining us.FORMER U.S. SENATOR FRED THOMPSON: Good to be with you.BLITZER: I don't remember a time when a political convention has been postponed or consolidated, truncated because of a natural disaster like this. You've been going to these conventions for a long time. Do you remember anything like this at all?THOMPSON: No, I don't. It just reminds us, I suppose, of the importance of events and the importance of things that haven't happened yet in our lives and certainly with regard to politics. And, you know, we just have to take them as they come and try to do the right thing.You know, I'm very impressed. It looks like the evacuation is going well. State and local officials are working together. Republican and Democrats are all being responsible in what they are saying and trying to do about it. And maybe here in the midst of this most political part of the political season, we can actually focus on, you know, some important things together.BLITZER: That would be good. I assume you agree, though, that at a time when people are fleeing their homes and there could be a huge disaster, it's no time for Republicans to be seen on this convention floor partying and hoopla and having a great time.THOMPSON: That's absolutely correct, but there's more to it than that. There's a reality underneath the appearance, and that is that people are concerned about what's happening down there, and people have loved ones and friends, and it's a part of our country. And, you know, we don't want to be diverted from attention on to that.KING: Have you heard anything, Senator, from the organizers about how they hope -- we know they are going to dramatically change the schedule, perhaps condensing the convention, but there's also talk of turning this into a service event, trying to take advantage, if you will, of all the people who are here and use volunteerism, fund- raising, something to help those who are affected by the storm. Still fluid, or are they starting to nail these things down?THOMPSON: I don't know, you know, I really don't know about that. I haven't been here very long myself. I was supposed to make a little talk tomorrow night about the relevant (ph) time, and of course that -- everything is all up in the air.Sounds like a good idea to me. I know that John McCain and Governor Palin are going down to Mississippi today, if they are not already there, and are going to be doing what they can there. I'm sure the Obama campaign is going to respond appropriately also. And, you know, we'll do the same thing here.It's unfortunate, of course, a lot of wonderful people and good workers coming from all over the country to a great expense to come here and celebrate together. But, again, we've got to keep our priorities straight.BORGER: Is this a particular matter of sensibility for Republicans, given the mismanagement of Hurricane Katrina?THOMPSON: No, I don't think so. The administration received a lot of criticism last time, no question about it. So did state and local government, you know, and there's enough blame to go around there, but that's kind of all in the past now. And it has some relevance, I guess, from that standpoint, but, you know, John...BORGER: John McCain has criticized the president's management.THOMPSON: Well, of course. I mean, I guess my point is there's no carry-over there as far as Republicans are concerned now, because they have got a leader now who has been critical when criticism was called for, and who is always about, you know, service and sacrifice and leadership, and that's what you're seeing now in his reaction to what's happening there.BLITZER: I suppose, Senator, you like all of us were pretty surprised at John McCain's decision to pick the Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his running mate. Be honest.THOMPSON: For a change?(LAUGHTER) I was surprised and delighted. I think it was an absolute -- you know -- great thing. This -- she is the kind of person that all of us in the Beltway and outside the Beltway are always talking about that we want, you know, somebody -- an outsider, somebody who will not get sucked in by the political process, somebody who is independent, somebody who will stand up to corruption and all that kind of thing. Well, guess what, that's exactly what you got.BLITZER: But the criticism...THOMPSON: And in many cases, she is a mirror of John McCain in that regard.BLITZER: The criticism is those are all excellent attributes that she has, but she has limited experience, a governor for less than two years, and really no national security or foreign policy experience.THOMPSON: Well, Wolf, I hate to break this to you, but you don't get national security experience by being on Sunday talk shows, and that's where a lot of these fellows get theirs. And you don't get national security experience from sitting on the floor of the Senate or the House and listening to what goes on there.The fact of the matter is, she's been in -- so some of those who claim it really don't have much either. She's been in public service for about 13 years now, state and local government. She is a reformer. She has experience not only in politics but in life. She's a mother of five children, and from an infant to a young man going into the military. And she has more experience than Barack Obama.So I think as long as we can continue to compare her experience with the presidential nominee of the Democrats, we're going to be in pretty good shape.BLITZER: Go ahead.BORGER: What do you say to those voters who are concerned about John McCain's age -- he's 72 years old -- and who wonder whether not that she has the executive experience, but whether she could be commander in chief?THOMPSON: Well, John's age, if you ever tried to keep up, I'm sure you have...BORGER: I have.THOMPSON: ... tried to keep up with John McCain. Everybody ought to try to keep up with John McCain. You know, I used to go on these codels with him, and...BLITZER: Those are congressional delegates, for the outside-the- Beltway crowd.(LAUGHTER) THOMPSON: Yes. And you know, he's kind of a two countries a day guy. And I think his 96-year-old mother will be here at the convention, so I'm not worried about John McCain.But, again, are we comparing the qualifications and experience of our vice presidential nominee with the Democrats' presidential nominee. I mean, does eloquence make up for his lack of experience? I don't think so.BLITZER: I think we understand what you're trying to say, Senator. Thanks very much for coming in.THOMPSON: Thanks a lot.BLITZER: All right, we're going to take another quick break, but we're following Hurricane Gustav right now. It's moving through the Gulf of Mexico, and guess what? It's heading towards New Orleans. We'll have a complete update.We'll also get a very different perspective from what we just heard from Senator Thompson. Senator Chris Dodd, the Democratic senator from Connecticut, he's standing by live. Our continuing coverage will resume right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: And welcome back to the floor of the Republican National Convention here at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul, Minnesota. We're waiting for word on whether or not there will be a convention. It's supposed to go on for four days beginning tomorrow but already we've heard that both President Bush and Vice President Cheney will not, repeat, not be attending because of Hurricane Gustav, a monster storm moving through the Gulf of Mexico right now with New Orleans right in the bull's eye, and that's having enormous ramifications on what's going on here but much more important on the lives of so many people along the Gulf Coast of the United States.Let's bring in Senator Chris Dodd. He's joining us now live from Washington. Senator Dodd is a Democratic senator, former Democratic presidential candidate.Thanks very much for coming in. What do you think the Republicans -- just as an outsider, you're a Democrat, what would be appropriate for them to do right now?SEN. CHRISTOPHER J. DODD, D-CONN.: Well, listen, Wolf, there's no doubt in my mind what's going on here. Had this -- the Bush administration not let this city drown basically three years ago, we wouldn't even be talking about this.It's a major storm coming through obviously and a lot of concern about it, but it was the failure of the Bush administration's actions three years ago that are creating all of this conversation, including the discussion about canceling or modifying the convention.So clearly that's what's going on here and it's a reminder at a time when, again, we're talking about leadership in the country, talking about a new direction for our nation, change in the country, that the Republican ticket here is one that really causes a lot of concern for people because this candidate has said over and over again he wants to have four more years like the eight years of the Bush administration.And candidly, that's one of the marks of that administration, of course, was the total failure to respond to a major American city in trouble.BLITZER: All right. I'm going to get to the political story in a moment, but based on everything you know, is the federal government right now, FEMA, the Department of Homeland Security, are they ready to deal with state and local authorities in Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, wherever this hurricane hits? Have they learned the lessons of Katrina?DODD: Well, I can only hope so, Wolf. But again, there has been a lot of stories since then. Now we've got new leadership at FEMA, and my only prayer and hope would be that they are doing exactly what they should have been doing three years ago.And so that's my concern at this particular moment. Glad to see there's a lot of concern about this in action, but I'll repeat what I said to you a moment ago. Don't have any illusions about this. Had they not failed miserably three years ago in dealing with Katrina, we wouldn't be having this conversation today.BLITZER: John King is here, and Gloria Borger, they're here. They're joining me in the questioning -- John.KING: Senator, I want to jump in on that point, you honestly believe that John McCain, a man you know well -- I know you disagree with him, that he would have a four-day political party, a balloon drop, a ""so what, I don't care"" convention had Katrina not happened, even with Gustav bearing down on the coast of the United States and another tropical storm, Hanna, potentially following behind it?He would do it anyway and just have a party, you honestly believe that?DODD: Well, I think this clearly, and John was critical of the Bush administration, but there's a concern about whether or not this administration, the Bush administration, one whose policies he has endorsed, will handle this appropriately.If there was a lot of confidence that those in authority today would respond to this as they should have, then frankly I think the convention would go on. There would be concerns about it, they would be talking about it, John, but they wouldn't be talking about canceling a convention.BORGER: Well, Senator Dodd, if this were your convention, what would you do?DODD: Well, again, I think you'd have appropriate people down there...BLITZER: All right. Hold on. Senator Dodd, hold on a second. The mayor of New Orleans, Ray Nagin, is just starting to speak. I want to listen in to hear what he's saying. Listen to this.MAYOR RAY NAGIN (D) NEW ORLEANS: All right. We ready? Everybody good?Good morning, everyone. We're here for the latest update from the city of New Orleans as it relates to the latest threat of Hurricane Gustav. I want to start by talking to you about the city- assisted emergency plan that we've been implementing for the past couple of days. We're now up to about 14,000 or 15,000 people that we have moved through the system and gotten out of town. Interesting enough, last night from midnight to 5:00 a.m., we worked all night, we moved 392 people and 36 people who were wheelchair- bound.I would like to publicly thank RTA, the employees from RTA who have been doing an incredible job of staying on the job and moving our citizens out of harm's way.As you know, we are planning to stop pickups at the 17 or the 15 pickup sites at noon today. That's our official stop time. But let me assure the public that we will continue with limited bus service. It won't be as frequent, as many as before, and we're going to try and continue that service until about 2:00 or 3:00 this afternoon.Let me repeat. The official stop time is noon today for city- assisted plan, but we're going to continue to service until 2:00 or 3:00 this afternoon to try and accommodate any late people who are coming.And I want to once again thank RTA for their incredible work. Let me get to the storm. The storm, as most of you know, is still headed our way. Nothing has changed as far as we can tell from the direction of the storm.It's a Cat. 3 right now, Category 3, but everyone that we have talked to in the latest update still say that this storm is going to be extremely powerful as a Category 4 storm, with winds of 150 miles an hour, sometimes gusting much higher than that.There is a little bit of good news in that the storm is moving at a much faster pace, and a fast-moving storm is a little bit better for us, not much better, but a little bit better. It's moving at 16 miles per hour, and it's still scheduled to slightly stall off the coast of Louisiana, which is not necessarily the best of news for us.One other threat tonight, since we're on the wrong side, if you will, of the storm, we should start to see tornado threats starting tonight and in the morning, which is something that we're going to have to really watch and pay attention to.So this is still a big ugly storm. It's still strong. And I strongly urge everyone to leave. On the contraflow, the contraflow is in effect. It started at 4:00 a.m. this morning. It's slow, but it's moving smoothly, going east is much slower.And we must let our citizens know that if you're going out I-10 east towards Mississippi, you will have to get off of I-10 and use 59 north when you get past Mississippi. I-10 east going towards Mississippi, once you get to a certain point, you will have to change to 59 north. So I'm going to make sure that everyone understands that.As it relates to mandatory evacuation, our mandatory evacuation went into effect this morning at 8:00 a.m. for the west bank, which is the area that the storm is still pointing towards to have the most impact, so we wanted to give our citizens time on the west bank to get out of town.We would then move to a noon mandatory evacuation on the east bank, 8:00 a.m. for the west bank and noon for the east bank.Everyone who evacuates, we will try and get you back in the city as soon as it's safe to come back. Whether you went out on a bus, a train, or a plane, whether you drove yourself out, we're going to try and get you back.I am asking the city council -- I am strongly asking the city council to go with my key staff members -- and I'm only going to keep a very small skeleton crew here, because of the severity of this storm, to set up what we're calling continuity of government.We don't know what's going to happen here in New Orleans, so I'm asking the city council to go with certain key staff members to set up a governmental station in Baton Rouge, so we can pass ordinances and government continue -- can continue to function.The next big announcement for today is that I want to announce that we have already filed with the clerk of court that we will be implementing this afternoon a curfew, a dusk-to-dawn curfew that will take into effect this afternoon starting at sunset. And we will continue that until the storm threat is open. We will start a curfew to this afternoon, once the sun sets.On one other point I'd like to make before I turn it over to the council president, I have two more points. On the trailers, I want to thank all of our citizens who have heeded our warning to get out of those trailers.We have done some sweeps around the city. And we can find -- and we find, fortunately, that most people have moved out of those trailers.But I want to talk to any citizen that is thinking of staying in the city, and they may have a home that is next to or near a trailer. Those trailers are on cinder blocks and, you know, what have you. They are only wind-rated to 35, 40 miles an hour.When this storm hits, those trailers will move around quite a bit. As a matter of fact, most some of them will become projectiles and will start to fly around the city. So be very careful if you decide to stay in the city and you're near a travel trailer, because they will be moving around in the city.Let me reiterate: Our call is for you to evacuate now. It's a mandatory evacuation for the west bank that started at 8 a.m. And for the east bank, we will be implementing a curfew at dusk this afternoon. The tropical storm is -- I mean, the hurricane is still severe and growing stronger, and it's scheduled to hit us as a Category 4 storm. Tropical storm-force winds could arrive in New Orleans as early as daybreak on Monday.And then, finally, I just talked to the sheriff and to the police chief. I just want to send a strong message out to anybody who's thinking about lingering around and becoming a looter. Looting will not be tolerated.We have doubled the police force, doubled the National Guard force that we had for Katrina, and looters will go directly to jail. You will not get out -- you will not get a pass this time.As a matter of fact, anybody who is caught looting in the city of New Orleans will go directly to Angola, directly to Angola. You will not have a temporary stay in the city. You'll go directly to the big house in general population, all right?So I want to make sure that every looter, potential looter, understands that. You will go directly to Angola prison. And God bless you when you go there.I'm going to turn it over to Council President Jackie Clarkson.JACKIE CLARKSON, NEW ORLEANS CITY COUNCIL PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And thank you...BLITZER: All right, so there it is, strong words from the mayor. If you are caught looting in New Orleans, you're going to go to that prison at Angola. He also announced there will be a dusk-to-dawn curfew, mandatory evacuations. Thousands of people are fleeing the Gulf Coast right now.Hurricane Gustav, right now it's a Category 3 storm, but it could intensify to a Category 4, maybe even a Category 5 storm. And it's potentially devastating, especially now as it takes direct aim on New Orleans, on this, the third anniversary of Hurricane Katrina.We were talking with Senator Chris Dodd, the Democratic senator from Connecticut, the former Democratic presidential candidate.You hear those words, Senator Dodd, from the mayor of New Orleans, whose community was so devastated only three years ago, it's hard to believe that this community could be further devastated now on the third anniversary of Katrina. Just give us your thoughts on the chances of this happening.DODD: Well, Wolf, if you'd written this up in a novel, no publisher would have taken it. This is too -- it's too bizarre to even suggest somehow that this could happen.And I, having traveled down there shortly after Katrina, and traveled that coast, from New Orleans all the way down to Mobile, it was unbelievable. Mississippi, I mean, all of that area, it's hard to imagine. I know people talked about it, and certainly CNN reported widely what had happened, but even the images of it are hard to portray the actual reality of it.So clearly the mayor -- and I commend him for it, the steps he's taking, the announcements he's making, certainly much better preparation now than was the case three years ago. And we applaud them for that.But the point, again, that we have to come back to here, you're sitting at a convention. Clearly, they're going to have to make decisions about whether or not to go forward.But, again, the point I want to make to you here, since we are talking about a political campaign with about 65 days to go, is the Republican nominee is one that has endorsed George Bush's overall policies.Now, he was critical of the handling of Katrina, as virtually everyone was at the time. But it seems to me it's important to remember Katrina symbolizes the failure of the Bush administration to respond to a major crisis in our country. And that's a point here that should not be forgotten at this hour.BLITZER: Hold on one second, Senator. We only have time for one more question, and I want you to respond to what Senator Fred Thompson, the former U.S. senator from Tennessee, said, himself a former Republican presidential candidate, that the vice presidential running mate for John McCain, the Alaska governor, Governor Sarah Palin, has more executive experience than the top of the Democratic ticket, Senator Barack Obama.DODD: Well, it's a ridiculous -- of course, Fred is my good friend, and he does a great job on ""Law and Order,"" and he's a great prosecutor. But I think of Elizabeth Dole, I think of Jodi Rell, the governor of Connecticut, I think of Kay Bailey Hutchison, I think of Susan Collins, Olympia Snowe.I can recite off the top of my head a number of Republican candidates, women who were far more qualified, with all due respect to Sarah Palin.So, again, John has made a choice here, but the suggestion somehow this is a wise choice -- this is the choice of Dobson, Robertson, and Limbaugh. This is a -- this is a real sop to the extreme conservative elements of the Republican Party.John McCain's knees buckled, because he was fearful of what the extreme right was going to say about this ticket. That's what this comes down to.BLITZER: Senator Dodd, thanks very much for joining us.DODD: Thank you very much, Wolf.BLITZER: All right, Senator Chris Dodd from Connecticut. We're standing by for another update on Hurricane Gustav. It's heading directly towards New Orleans and the Gulf Coast. We'll update you on that. Much more of our coverage from the Republican National Convention, which right now is really up in the air because of Gustav, we'll continue right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: Welcome back. We're here on the floor of the Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minnesota. This is a special ""Late Edition.""This convention was supposed to start tomorrow, but it could be in free fall right now, given what's happening along the Gulf Coast. They're preparing for landfall around midday tomorrow early afternoon, and New Orleans right now in the bull's eye.John King and Gloria Borger are here with me.John, we heard two very different assessments from Senator Chris Dodd, the Democrat, former Senator Fred Thompson, the Republican. You know, as much as people would like to say politics is going to go away because of a natural disaster like this, politics very much going to be -- especially in this political season, going to be with us.KING: And Senator Dodd seeing an opportunity there to make the Democratic case that the Republicans are canceling, changing, modifying their convention because of the hangover from Katrina, if you will.And there's no doubt about it that Americans remember Katrina, and they remember and they have blamed the Bush administration, state and local officials, as well, but the president runs the country, and the president took a lot of blame for that. And there's no question that fallout continues.However, I do think it is fair to say that John McCain would have modified somewhat had Katrina never happened in the first place, just because they do understand, all the people around him, that you can't be having a party and a balloon drop if a major American city, New Orleans or somewhere else, is underwater.BLITZER: I think that's a fair assessment.What do you think?BORGER: Sure. And I think, in many ways, the Republicans can look at this as an opportunity, if they want to be crassly political about it, to show that the theme of this convention, which John was talking about earlier, which is service, can actually be worked on publicly.If you want to hold a telethon, if you want to donate to Red Cross, if you want to send people from the convention to the Gulf Coast, I mean, there are -- there are all kinds of things the Republicans can do at this convention to show that John McCain and Sarah Palin care and would manage a hurricane very differently from the way George W. Bush managed Katrina.KING: And that will happen. There will be -- there will be a component of service. We still don't know about the schedule. I'm told there will be dramatic changes announced probably in an hour or so, but we do know the convention planners have already been in touch with the Red Cross. They're going to definitely raise money and have other service components using the delegates who are here to get them involved in the effort.John McCain is down there today. Some of the other stuff is still in a flux, because it's a very difficult decision. But we do -- one thing they -- by rules, they have to nominate a candidate. They will do that. Everything else I'm told is in flux, because they're trying to get the latest on the storm.BLITZER: And we do know that the president of the United States and the vice president of the United States, both of them have decided they're not coming here tomorrow. They were both supposed to address this convention tomorrow, but George Bush and Dick Cheney have decided they're not coming here.We'll take another quick break. Much more of our coverage on this special ""Late Edition"" right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) BLITZER: We're here at Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul, Minnesota. This is where the Republicans were supposed -- they're scheduled to hold a convention for four days beginning tomorrow. But as we've been reporting, everything up in the air right now.Only within the last half hour or so ago, we learned that both President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney will not be attending this convention. They were supposed to be here tomorrow.Let's assess what's going on, as Hurricane Gustav moves towards New Orleans and the Gulf Coast.Joining us now is Tara Wall, the editorial page editor of the Washington Times, and Roland Martin. Both are CNN contributors.Tara, what should the Republicans do as far as this convention is concerned?TARA WALL, WASHINGTON TIMES: Well, I trust they'll do the right thing. They'll use their judgment to make the calls that are necessary and that are needed.I will -- I would anticipate probably a more truncated schedule, if you will. I think that already you've seen these schedules pared back quite a bit.So I would expect to see quite a bit and that the Republicans and John McCain will make the right decision in deciding how to go forward.BLITZER: I assume you agree, right, Roland?ROLAND MARTIN, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: No, I would say that they nominate John McCain tomorrow and shut the convention down. And if this hurricane hits on Tuesday and it brings the level of devastation that we're likely to see, there's not going to be any media coverage of this convention.And so any kind of advantage you want to get out of it, frankly, you're not going to get. And so it doesn't make any sense to pare anything down. You nominate John McCain, and you shut it down, because there will be nothing to talk about, frankly, come Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.BLITZER: Because the hurricane, Roland, is supposed to hit early afternoon tomorrow. Monday, at least right now, it's projected to hit around New Orleans, maybe between noon or 1 o'clock local time, Central time.So what you're saying is, is even though the -- even though it hits, go ahead, do the formal business of nominating a presidential candidate and a vice presidential candidate, and then get out of Dodge.Is that a good -- a good piece of advice, Tara? WALL: Well, I think, again, you're already seeing some of that. I mean, of course, President Bush is not coming. Vice President Cheney is not coming. You see, of course, the three governors aren't coming. All these people played a major role in this convention. They won't be there.So, again, it probably, yes, will likely be a more truncated convention. Whether that's one days, two days, I think, again, that's the -- they'll figure out what the responsible thing is to do to make sure they're dealing with the issue at hand, as well as dealing with the business of their party and the nominee.So I expect perhaps that could be a one- to two-day convention. But, again, I mean, it's not my call, so...BLITZER: Right. It's not any of our call. We're all waiting and hopefully in the next hour or two we'll get the word from these organizers of the Republican convention what they plan on doing.Let me ask both of you, because I haven't spoken to you since John McCain announced that the Alaska governor, Sarah Palin, would be his running mate.Tara, first to you. Good choice, bad choice, what do you think?WALL: I've got to tell you, it was a proud day for me as a black woman and American last week, with the first black nominee of any major party and the first woman of the Republican Party as a major nominee, second in history, so I'm proud all around on that end.And I think, quite frankly, I was skeptical from the beginning when I heard about her name a few months ago. When you read the woman's record, experience or not, the experience that she does have is pretty impressive.And I've heard from conservatives all weekend they are re- energized and fired up about this candidate. Say what you will, the conservative base is fired up about her.MARTIN: Hey, Wolf...BLITZER: Roland, Roland -- hold on, Roland -- a proud day for you, too?MARTIN: Not necessarily, because -- I mean, first of all, what I find to be interesting is, I mean, as a native Texan, you know, I hate the fact that Kay Bailey Hutchison didn't get the job, because she's far more qualified than the Alaska governor.But, also, as an Evangelical -- and John King knows it, because he's (inaudible) election -- I mean, Mike Huckabee was the best choice. Here's a guy who was the governor of Arkansas for 11 years, an ordained minister, who won the Iowa caucus. Right now, McCain is behind in Iowa.MARTIN: If you want to galvanize grassroots evangelicals... WALL: But he -- no, he had issues...(CROSSTALK)MARTIN: Tara, Tara, one second.WALL: He had issues with fiscal conservatives.MARTIN: Tara, one second. If you want to galvanize grassroots evangelicals, you go after the guy who won the Iowa Caucus where you're down right now. So, I'm sorry, I think he's a much better pick than she is.WALL: Well, she covers all of those. She is evangelical, she is a Christian, she is a reformer, she is very conservative, she has bucked her own...MARTIN: She's unproven.WALL: She has bucked her own party. She is absolutely not unproven, when you go and you look at her record and what she has fought up against and what she has fought for. The short time in office that she has had, she has fought against -- she has fought against the government, she has fought against her own party, she has cut her own salary. The woman has...MARTIN: Who delivered the evangelicals in the primary?WALL: And she...MARTIN: Who delivered them? Huckabee did.WALL: And she is staunchly pro-life. Not to take away anything from Mike Huckabee...MARTIN: So was Huckabee!WALL: ...but some of the problems Huckabee had was with fiscal conservatives. And those are some of the problems that he posed. Look, there are a number of...BLITZER: All right. Guys...WALL: ...great candidates, but I think when you're looking at someone outside of Washington, the folks that talk about the change, this is the real kind of...MARTIN: Huckabee is from Arkansas.WALL: ... outside of Washington change that folks are talking about.MARTIN: Huckabee is from Arkansas.BLITZER: All right. Roland, hold your fire. Hold your fire, Roland, because I know you're anxious to respond, but we're going to have plenty of time to talk about Sarah Palin and John McCain and Barack Obama and Joe Biden.Stand by. Much more of our coverage coming up here. We're at the Republican National Convention, but Hurricane Gustav continues to move towards New Orleans in the Gulf Coast. We'll update you on what we know right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: You just heard live here on CNN, the mayor of New Orleans, Ray Nagin, announce that there's a dawn-to-dusk curfew in New Orleans starting tonight and that looters will immediately go to a prison. No holding places or anything like that. They go to jail right away. They're having enormous, enormous preparations under way along the Gulf Coast. We're watching this.But I want to go down to the floor of this convention, which may or may not take place starting tomorrow. Ed Henry is on the floor for us right now.What are you hearing, Ed, from where you are? Because it seems everything is up in the air.ED HENRY, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely. And everyone you talk to who is just filtering in to St. Paul, all of these Republicans who have been planning this for almost two years now are wondering, they're asking us what's going on.The latest is, everyone is behind the scenes basically on conference calls, talking to one another. As you mentioned earlier, as John King did, Rick Davis, the campaign chairman, is trying to reach out to Republicans, figure out the best way to handle this. This is an unprecedented situation.But Republicans realize that in the middle of this, what could be a catastrophic storm, they can't possibly show the American people images of them partying, having a good time, launching political attacks.So they want to find the right balance at this point. So what obviously seems likely is somehow shrinking it, somehow getting all of the business into a smaller amount of time without canceling the whole thing together.But obviously everything is on the table right now, but as John has been saying, you have to at the very least nominate John McCain as well as Sarah Palin. And let's face it, in fairness to John McCain, he has to get some time in the spotlight at some point this week.Barack Obama just had his hour in prime time. The Democrats had a full week to make their case to the American people. So the Republicans are just trying to find a balancing act -- Wolf.BLITZER: All right. Jessica Yellin is on the floor as well.Jessica, thousands of Republicans are coming in, delegates, supporters, family members, friends. They're coming in. There's one thought of maybe turning this into some public service, a fund-raiser for the people who are going to -- about to be devastated along the Gulf Coast.You've been speaking with delegate delegates, what are you hearing?JESSICA YELLIN, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, they know that the theme of the convention is ""service first."" And it seems to them a fitting way to take care of both honoring what this convention is about and also acknowledging what's going on in the Gulf Coast.I think delegates here who are just beginning to arrive are perfectly amenable to that option and there is some anxiety that they wouldn't want to be seen partying, in essence, while this is going on in the Gulf.So the idea is to whip out cell phones, to make care packages, whatever it takes to acknowledge the Gulf Coast.BLITZER: Jessica, stand by. Ed Henry, stand by. We're going to continue our coverage, give you an update on Hurricane Gustav and a lot more coming up right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: These are aerial photos just coming in to CNN right now from New Orleans. If you get closer -- and we're going to show our viewers some closer shots -- it looks almost eerie what's going on in New Orleans, as thousands, tens of thousands of people have been forced to evacuate.We've seen long lines of cars heading north, getting out of the city. There's a mandatory evacuation. The mayor of New Orleans, Ray Nagin, just announcing a dusk-to-dawn curfew starting tonight.And anyone caught looting, anyone, he says, caught looting, there will be no pity at all. They go right to Angola. That's an -- that's an awful prison in Louisiana. And he says they'll be sent right into the general prison population. Trust me. You don't want to be there, so don't start looting in New Orleans.These are long gas lines you're seeing from these aerial photos. As vehicles try to get out of the city, they need gas. And there are long lines, as well.You can see what's going on, people getting out of town as quickly as they possibly can. They're taking no chances on this, the third anniversary of Hurricane Katrina.We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer.We're reporting here from the Republican National Convention. We're on the floor of this convention, which was supposed to start tomorrow and continue for four days, but it doesn't look like that's going to happen. Everything right now is up in the air. The White House has just announced that both President Bush and Vice President Cheney will not be coming to St. Paul, Minnesota, tomorrow. They were both scheduled to address this convention tomorrow, but both will remain either in Washington or head over to the Gulf Coast to be in charge of this hurricane disaster.Let's get an update from Reynolds Wolf. He's at the CNN Weather Center.Reynolds, only a little while ago, the National Hurricane Center gave us an update. Tell our viewers who may be just be joining us in the United States and around the world what we know about Gustav. WOLF: OK, Wolf. Here's the latest.The latest we have for you, the storm currently is winds sustained -- maximum sustained winds of 120 miles per hour. It's got some gusts, though, that have been much stronger, going to 150, moving to the northwest at 17 miles an hour.That is the biggest change we've seen so far in the forecast, is the forward progress, moving to the northwest, I mentioned, going from 16 to 17 miles an hour. That could make a tremendous difference when this storm makes landfall.Right now, the center is about 414 miles away from New Orleans. Here's the center; here's New Orleans. The latest path we have from the National Hurricane Center shows the storm still moving on that track, going to the northwest.As it moves to the northwest, it is expected, at least in the forecast from the National Hurricane Center, to strengthen quite a bit, going from a Category 3 storm to a Category 4, with maximum sustained winds around 135 miles an hour early into Monday, and then making landfall just to the southwest of New Orleans, possibly within 70 miles of the city, then moving in to parts of central Louisiana, and then back into Texas and Louisiana.Now, one thing to mention with this, Wolf, is that you have this -- this cone of probability, of uncertainty, if you will. The storm could still move a little bit more to the east, perhaps push back to the west. Many changes can take place in the storm, and we have to watch it very carefully.Something else we'd like to share with you and the viewers, some numbers that we've got from FEMA. You'll notice these are numbers that we have from a program from FEMA called HAZUS that gives us an estimation of what is in the path of the storm and what might be affected.Roughly 5.6 million people in the path of this storm. Roughly 2 million buildings could see an estimated damage in excess of $26.7 billion. Also in the path, 217 hospitals, 722 police stations.Now, to give you an idea, a meteorological sense of what this storm can bring, remember, if it is a Category 4 storm, or at least a strong 3, we could have a storm surge that could be in excess of anywhere from, say, 13 to 18 feet, that on top of the high tides you might have on the southern coast of Louisiana. And, of course, that water could really pile up in places like Lake Pontchartrain.Small residences, mobile homes could be completely destroyed in a storm like this, large trees blown down, knocking down power lines, widespread power outages certainly a possibility. Terrain lower than 10 feet above sea level may flood, requiring massive evacuations.And you'll remember that much of Louisiana is built below sea level. It's kind of in a bowl, if you will. So with a storm of this magnitude, I would say flooding is definitely going to be a certainty, not just in places like New Orleans, Wolf, but when this storm begins to stall out, especially in parts of northern Louisiana and into Texas, we're going to be talking about widespread flooding, massive flooding well into next week, possibly into Wednesday, Thursday, maybe even next weekend.Back to you.BLITZER: And, Reynolds, when you say the -- the landfall could be about 70 miles southwest of New Orleans, the point has to be made -- and I want you to underscore it -- that, if you're on the east side of that landfall, that's potentially the most dangerous part.We heard the mayor of New Orleans, Ray Nagin, said they're on the bad side of this hurricane. Explain what he means.WOLF: What he means by that is that, on the right-hand side of the storm, you happen to have the biggest weight of, say, the power of the storm. The storm, Wolf, is spinning in a counterclockwise motion.Imagine, viewers at home, you're looking at my back. If I'm a heavyweight boxer, and I'm a right-handed guy, and I've got a really strong right hook, well, my hook is going to be strongest going in this direction.So you have that counterclockwise flow, the sheer weight of the water, the wind, the rain, all going around the center of circulation. Places like Pensacola, Mobile, New Orleans, especially New Orleans would tax the sheer brunt of this storm.Now, if you'll remember, in Katrina, Katrina was actually a Category 3 when it made landfall and it was just to the east of New Orleans. It actually made landfall in parts of Mississippi.So New Orleans actually got -- was affected by the weakest part of the storm. This scenario, should it follow out by the National Hurricane Center, it will be the opposite, the storm really affecting -- the strongest part of the storm affecting New Orleans. And that is what Mayor Nagin was referring to.BLITZER: Because he's really worried that, as bad as Katrina was, this one could be even worse. Fortunately, it looks like everyone has learned a lot of lessons from Katrina and they've got their act together. We can only hope that the federal, state, and local authorities are really doing what they need to be doing to save lives right now.All right, stand by. We're going to come back to Reynolds, because he's constantly getting updates.I want to go to New Orleans right now. Susie Roesgen is there for us.Set the scene. When we heard the mayor earlier -- and we're hoping to get him on the phone so we can ask him a few questions, Susie -- this is something that New Orleans has dreaded since Katrina. You know, who would have thought that, almost exactly three years later, it was about to happen again?But tell us what's going on. You're there.ROESGEN: Well, I've got to tell you, Wolf, I was here also in Hurricane Katrina. And in that time period, we would have been watching Reynolds' track go back and forth and back and forth. People were waiting, because we really felt that the storm was going to go to the east or the west of us, far enough that we wouldn't feel it.This time, people here in New Orleans are getting out. They know what a catastrophic event Katrina was. They know that the levees failed. They don't know that they'll be safe again here. This is even a more powerful storm, so most people have gotten out.But there are the hospitals, and there are a few hospitals, including, Wolf, the one that I'm here this morning, Children's Hospital, where they've decided to keep these hospitals open. At Children's right now, there are 80 young patients, more than half of whom are in critical care units.And that means that it would be very difficult to evacuate those patients. It would be hard for them. So doctors and nurses have volunteered to stay here. They're going to stay and watch the young patients.The hospital has trucked in 70,000 gallons of diesel fuel to keep the generators going. They think, Wolf, that they can withstand this and ride it out here for three weeks. And we're going to be here and see how they're doing.If they have to, they will get the patients out by helicopter, but they're not planning to do it. They're planning to stay.Just about everybody else in the city, Wolf, has gotten out, either by charter buses, or by the Amtrak trains, or in their own cars. They didn't even wait for the mayor to say, ""Get out. This is the mother of all storms,"" as Mayor Nagin put it. They knew it. They got out already.Wolf?BLITZER: So based on your experience three years ago -- you were there during Hurricane Katrina, Susie -- and based on what you're seeing right now, I think it's fair to say that it looks like a lot of people have learned lessons and they're really paying attention, they're doing a better job right now than three years ago. Is that your assessment?ROESGEN: Oh, absolutely. The mayor said it in his speech, but he didn't need to remind us here in New Orleans. He said, if you stay, you might be using an ax to hack your way out of the roof.This is what thousands of people did here. They were flooded. The water forced them up, up, up. They were chopping their ways out of a roof -- out of their roofs to get out in the big flood.So people here got the message. Some of them -- I've got to tell you, though, Wolf, and this is something we need to think about as we go forward after the hurricane -- and that's how many New Orleanians will come back.I have talked to so many of my friends here who say, you know what, even if it doesn't hit, Wolf, even if it doesn't come here and devastate the city, as it might, they're not coming back. They say they've had it.They've rebuilt their homes. They stuck it out. They waited for the federal money. Some of them didn't even get it. They're here now. And they say, ""You know what? We can't go through this anymore. We're done.""So it will be very interesting to see what happens to this city, wherever the hurricane might go.BLITZER: And I want you to be very, very careful, Susie Roesgen. All of our reporters and producers and camera crews, they're staying in New Orleans and in the area to make sure we get all the accurate information. Anderson Cooper is there for us, as well.We're going to have much more coverage of what's going on with Hurricane Gustav as it moves towards New Orleans and the Gulf Coast. We're also going to have much more coverage on how it will impact what was supposed to be a Republican National Convention in St. Paul.The Republican leader in Congress, John Boehner, he's here with us. The former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle with weigh in. Much more of our coverage right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: By the tens of thousands, they're fleeing New Orleans right now. The mayor has just declared a dusk-to-dawn curfew tonight. And he says anyone violating that curfew -- and especially anyone found looting -- immediately goes to jail.We're here at the Republican National Convention, where the schedule is very much tentative because of Hurricane Gustav, which is moving towards New Orleans and the Gulf Coast.John King has been doing some reporting on what we know. What we do know is that the president and the vice president, they've decided they're not coming to St. Paul.KING: The president and the vice president are not coming. Laura Bush, the first lady, is still scheduled to be here for Monday night's opening session.I'm told that they have made some tentative decisions, Wolf, and there will be some very complicated changes to the convention program. That's all they're willing to say right now, because while Rick Davis, the chairman of the McCain campaign, is here, he met with convention planners today, and they went through all of the contingencies, including getting an update on the path of Gustav.John McCain is on his way to Mississippi at this hour to go down and get a look at the preparations for the storm from the Gulf Coast area. And they want to talk to him before he will make the final decisions about the implementation.But they have reached some tentative decisions about what I'm told are very complicated changes to the convention program. We don't know exactly what they are.We do know that the convention planners have been in touch with the Red Cross and other service organizations to try to do some things here. The delegates will be here to try to see how they can take advantage of this mass of people, if you will, and get them involved in some sort of service, fundraising and otherwise, to help those who are about to be affected by this storm.BLITZER: So translate this disaster maybe into something good coming out of here, because it would be, I guess, unseemly to be partying and having hoopla while an American city and the Gulf Coast could be destroyed again, three years after Katrina.KING: No doubt the tone of the convention will change significantly.BLITZER: Obviously that has to happen.All right, the Republican leader, the minority leader in the House of Representatives, is here, John Boehner. Nancy Pfotenhauer is here, a senior adviser to the McCain campaign. Gloria Borger is joining us in the questioning.What do you think, Mr. Leader? What should these convention organizers, your fellow Republicans, do right now?REP. JOHN A. BOEHNER, R-OHIO: Well, I think everyone is concerned about the people who live along the Gulf Coast. This is going to be a serious natural disaster, and I think people ought to be sensitive to this, and John McCain, especially.John McCain's someone who's always put the country first. And, clearly, when you look at this potential disaster, putting the country first is the right thing to do.BLITZER: So what should they do? In terms of -- you have a four-day convention that's supposed to happen. Do you truncate it into two days, one day, two hours? What do you do?BOEHNER: There will be an announcement in several hours about how the convention will proceed and when it will proceed. Those decisions, I think, are close to being finalized (OFF-MIKE) there'll be an announcement soon. And everyone will know just how we're going to proceed with the convention.BLITZER: Nancy, what do you think? Because, you know, you work for John McCain. He's your boss. This is a sensitive -- very sensitive issue you've got to deal with right now, because thousands of people's lives are on the line.NANCY PFOTENHAUER, MCCAIN CAMPAIGN ADVISER: Absolutely. And that's why he's already been in touch with, obviously, Governor Barbour, but also Governors Crist, Governors Riley, Governor Jindal, just to try to get a feel for their anticipation of what will occur. And that's going to inform his decisions.But, you know, action -- I've always said actions speak louder than words. And he's on the plane out there right now to assess the situation on the ground. And he's going to take advice from the people who are experts and who are out there. And that's going to directly impact how we spend our time over the next several days.BORGER: All right, Congressman Boehner, I want to ask you to put on your congressional hat for a moment, because you folks in Congress spent an awful lot of time and money investigating why the levees failed and how to fix the levees. You spent about, what, $15 billion?BOEHNER: Fifteen to twenty billion dollars.BORGER: So what's your sense about whether the levees are going to be able to withstand whatever's coming at them?BOEHNER: Well, you have to understand that, while the money was appropriated, only about 20 percent of the work upgrading the levees has been accomplished. This is a long process that's going to take another three, or four, or five years to raise the height of these levees.And these are unusual levees. These wouldn't be like levees you'd see here in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Because they have to be so much higher, the width of the levees is so much wider. And so it's a massive job.But over the next three or four years, you'll see all of those levees up. But the levees today are in better shape than they were when Katrina hit.BORGER: Right, but it's still only one-fifth completed, you said, right?BOEHNER: That's correct. In terms of the new designs, the new heights.KING: If you listen to Democrats today, many of them are making the case that your tone will change more dramatically here because of the hangover, the legacy, the political damage on the Bush administration from Katrina. A fair assessment?BOEHNER: I think everyone learned a lot from Katrina. Clearly, the federal government wasn't ready. A lot of the state governments weren't ready. And, frankly, I don't think the people in America were ready for such a horrific natural disaster.And so I think what we see now is that we're all more sensitive. We're all more prepared for -- for what could occur. And, clearly, if you look at the precautions that are being taken today in New Orleans, they're light years ahead of what happened prior to Katrina.BLITZER: Nancy, we heard from Senator Chris Dodd just a little while ago really saying that this decision by John McCain, your boss, to ask the Alaska governor, Sarah Palin, to be his running mate was -- you know, I'm paraphrasing now -- really bad, because he's suggesting that there were so many other Republican women, Kay Bailey Hutchison, a senator from Texas. He had a whole bunch of names who were clearly more qualified, God forbid, to become commander-in-chief than Sarah Palin.Go ahead. Make the case why this woman, with no real national security or foreign policy experience, is ready on day one, as John McCain had said earlier, ready to become commander-in-chief.PFOTENHAUER: I think that Governor Palin has -- she's just had a remarkable journey. She has actually challenged the status quo. She's a reformer with a record of reform, and Senator McCain respects that.You know, it's one of those things where -- to get points on the board with John McCain, you have to prove that you're willing to do something when it's difficult and unpopular. And -- and if it's the right thing to do when it's difficult to do, then he has respect for you.She earned his respect. And she's earned it with the people of Alaska. She's the most popular governor in the country. She's already gotten through things like a pipeline that they tried to get through for 30 years, and she's gotten it through.BLITZER: But on a basis of one meeting he had with her earlier this year in February, she's a finalist to become his running mate?PFOTENHAUER: Wolf, she won it on the merits. He wasn't selecting who he was going to want as a drinking buddy or a pal. He was selecting someone who has the -- who has the proven reform record to come in and help him shake up this town.And, frankly, that's not somebody like a Joe Biden, who has spent more time in government than out.PFOTENHAUER: I mean, Senator -- our number two on the ticket is more qualified than Barack Obama is, the number one on the Democratic ticket. And Senator Biden, I mean, they threw over change right off the side of the bathtub, if you will, with Senator Biden, because he is, if not a creature of Washington, he has spent more time in government than out.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: But in fairness -- hold on, hold on. In fairness, Senator McCain has spent, what, 26 years in Washington, so you're implicitly criticizing your boss?PFOTENHAUER: No. What I'm -- but Senator McCain has during that period of time challenged his own party when they were wrong. He has taken on the status quo. He has worked across party lines to do things that were difficult. And we all know that, because this is our town.(CROSSTALK)BORGER: ... answers that commander-in-chief question, and maybe the congressman would want to take that.BOEHNER: I just find this conversation that has gone the last two days almost appalling. And it comes from liberal Democrats who want to criticize the selection of Governor Palin. And it's almost like, if you're not a Washington insider, you don't count. You can't possibly know what it's like.Listen, she has got more executive experience than Barack Obama and Joe Biden put together.BORGER: Or John McCain?BOEHNER: And when you look at the job, the job of being president or vice president, it's an administrative job. She actually has made decisions. When you're a senator, you get to decide yes or no. You get to go out and make some statements. But when you're the governor, you actually have to make decisions that have consequences.Now -- and for them to belittle this very accomplished woman, I think is -- they're doing so at their own peril. PFOTENHAUER: I agree. I think they've been dangerously dismissive of this woman's accomplishments and I think that's going to come back to bite them.BLITZER: All right. We're out of time for this discussion, but this discussion will continue. I have no doubt. Thanks, guys, very much for coming in. We'll get a different perspective, Tom Daschle, the former Senate majority leader, a longtime supporter of Barack Obama, he's standing by live and I'm sure he has a different assessment of what's going on.We'll also update you on Hurricane Gustav as it's moving towards New Orleans and the Gulf Coast. Much more of our coverage. We're here at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul, Minnesota, where there's supposed to be a Republican Convention starting tomorrow. We'll see if it will start tomorrow. Stay with us, LATE EDITION continues right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: Welcome back. We're here in St. Paul, Minnesota, at the Republican National Convention, which is supposed to begin tomorrow and continue for four days, but that schedule now completely up in the air.The president of the United States, George Bush, the vice president, Dick Cheney, they're not coming tomorrow. They had been scheduled to address this convention tomorrow. All of this because Hurricane Gustav is moving towards New Orleans and the Gulf right now.It's supposed to make landfall early afternoon tomorrow, Monday, maybe around noon Central time, 1:00 p.m. Eastern, maybe a little bit later. It's a Category 3 monster right now, but it could go up to a Category 4, maybe even a Category 5. Winds of about maybe even 170 miles an hour.The enormity of this, on the third anniversary of Katrina, simply unbelievable as we're watching what's going on. Stand by, we'll have a complete update on the hurricane. But we're also watching the political fallout of the race for the White House. Joining us now is the former Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle. He was an early and very robust supporter of Barack Obama. He still is.Senator Daschle, thanks very much for coming in.TOM DASCHLE (D), FMR. SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: My pleasure, Wolf.BLITZER: John King and Gloria Borger are here. They're going to join me in the questioning. Just as an outside -- you're not a Republican, you have nothing to do with this convention, but what do you think the Republicans need to do right now, because potentially New Orleans and the entire Gulf Coast could be under water pretty soon?DASCHLE: Well, Wolf, I don't think there's any choice. But the whole country needs to focus on this incredible emergency. And our thoughts and prayers go out to everybody in the path of the hurricane, especially those in New Orleans.You know, we don't think about politics at this point as much as we think about survival. That story you had about the children, 60 children in a hospital who we know are going to have to ride through that storm in the next few days is just a phenomenal illustration of the consequences of what this is all about.So it's almost hard to talk or think about politics or the convention when you have that much life and that much at stake.BLITZER: We know there were horrible mistakes made three years ago in advance of Katrina and during and after Katrina by the federal government, state authorities, local government in New Orleans itself. Are you confident right now that they've learned the lessons and that they have their act together? DASCHLE: You know, I'm not confident. I sure hope they do. I hope that whatever lessons learned are applied. And you know, we're seeing indications, perhaps, that things are better and that the preparation is better and that both at the city level, the state level, and hopefully now at the federal level we're going to have our act together unlike anything we've seen before.But three years ago it was an absolute disaster. And I think the response was almost as bad as the disaster itself. And I'm just hopeful that we've pulled our act together adequately enough to deal with this in a far more successful manner.BLITZER: All right. I want you to respond to what we just heard from Congressman John Boehner, the minority leader in the House of Representatives, and Nancy Pfotenhauer, a senior adviser to Senator McCain's campaign, that Sarah Palin, the governor of Alaska, has more actual experience in...(AUDIO GAP)DASCHLE: Wolf, I...BLITZER: Can you hear me, Senator?DASCHLE: Oh, I lost -- now I can hear you. I just lost it for a minute.BLITZER: All right.BLITZER: Let me repeat the question.DASCHLE: OK.BLITZER: We heard from John Boehner, the minority leader in the House of Representatives just moments ago, and Nancy Pfotenhauer, a senior adviser to John McCain's campaign, that Sarah Palin, the governor of Alaska, McCain's running mate, has more experience actually in running government than Barack Obama. DASCHLE: Well, it's actually -- the choice is somewhat mystifying to me, Wolf. It's inexplicable. John McCain, for the last year, has basically said one thing. The next president of the United States is going to have to have the ability to focus the experience and all of the resources it's going to take to be a strong person in foreign policy and make the decisions necessary to get us through this very, very difficult challenges we face.So who does he pick? Somebody who has absolutely no experience in that regard. The only explanation to me is that he buckled, he knuckled under to the extreme right-wing pressures that he was feeling these last several weeks. That's the only real explanation I can think of.BORGER: Well, Senator, it's Gloria. Senator, what do you say to those women though who like the idea of having a woman on the national ticket? These folks here before were saying that some of the Democrats have moved dangerously close to being sexist in their criticism of Governor Palin.DASCHLE: This has nothing to sex, Gloria, at all, or sexual -- you know, just the fact is, you've got a lot of very strong women. Kay Bailey Hutchison's name has been mentioned several times. You know, she would have been a perfect choice.DASCHLE: There are a lot of other Republican women who could have easily filled this role, if that's what he was looking for.I think they have to be concerned about what message it may send about being too patronizing with regard to the transparency of this choice, as well.So it's not the woman issue at all. I think it's -- it's really a question of, how much is John McCain going to listen to the right wing as he makes these critical decisions? And at least so far, it's pretty clear: 100 percent of the time.KING: Senator, it's John King here. Let me talk to you about your region of the country. Barack Obama has tried to change the map, to try to put the Dakotas in play, Montana in play, Colorado, other states out in the West.What about Sarah Palin out there, a governor who comes from the state of Alaska, who is a hunter and a sportswoman, who has a lifetime membership in the NRA? Is it possible that she could be an asset out in the West?DASCHLE: Well, it's interesting that they're looking for assets, John, in that regard. I think what it says is that the Republicans recognize that they're in trouble in the West.We've seen the trend over the last couple of cycles with governors, senators, and congressmen -- we have more and more on the Democratic side. I think the West is more in play than it's ever been before.So in addition to the right-wing concerns that he might have had, I think the other issue is, do I need to shore up the West with a nominee from the West? And that may have been part of his calculation.BLITZER: Senator Daschle, thanks very much for joining us.DASCHLE: My pleasure, Wolf.BLITZER: And we're going to continue our coverage here on this special ""Late Edition."" We'll update you on Hurricane Gustav, as it's moving through the Gulf of Mexico, moving towards New Orleans and the Gulf Coast, and continue our political coverage from this Republican convention. Right now, everything here, everything is literally up in the air. We're hearing that some announcements are going to be made fairly soon. As soon as we know what the Republicans plan on doing, we'll share it with you. Stay with us. ""Late Edition"" continues right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: And joining us now, the Republican governor of South Carolina, Mark Sanford, and the Republican congressman from Virginia, Eric Cantor. By all accounts, he was on the short list to be a vice presidential running mate.Let me go to Governor Sanford first. South Carolina, as we know over the years has had to deal with its share of hurricanes. I know you're anxious to try to help if you can those folks in Louisiana, or Mississippi, or Texas that are about to be impacted by Hurricane Gustav.What do you think? Is the federal government ready right now to deal with state and local authorities? Have they learned the lessons of Katrina?GOV. MARK SANFORD, R-S.C.: I believe so. There was a real after-action review, both at the state level, the federal level, the local level in the wake of Katrina. And, you know, the federal government, if you want to call it that, is very much standing forward in this storm cycle. So, yes, I think that they're prepared.I would also say, at the state level, you have what are called EMAC agreements, wherein states help other states out and cities help other cities out.I just had a conversation this morning. The city of Charleston is already in the process of sending law enforcement folks to that part of the world, because, indeed, many hands make light work. And if that storm hits, as we suspect it will, there's going to be a lot of work to be done.BLITZER: And I'm sure if a hurricane were moving towards South Carolina, you'd be grateful for any help you could get from your fellow governors elsewhere who could dispatch whether law enforcement or emergency medical personnel, National Guard troops, or whatever.Eric Cantor, what do you think? I know you were planning on coming out here to St. Paul. What do you think these Republican organizers of this convention need to do now, given the enormity of what's about to happen in New Orleans and elsewhere in the gulf?REP. ERIC CANTOR, R-VA.: Well, Wolf, it is correct. I'm about to head out in a couple of hours. Obviously, we've been told that there's going to be an announcement coming soon as to how the convention will proceed.There's no question, though, that this will change the tone of the convention. We must and should be focused on the folks in the gulf region that are facing once again a life-threatening hurricane.And this is a time when our country really shuns politics and wants to focus on the most important thing, which is making sure that the people of that region survive and escape this horrific storm heading for them.BLITZER: We got some pictures -- we're just getting in some pictures of President Bush. He's been over at FEMA headquarters, and he's been speaking. We'll show some of these pictures to you.But, Governor Sanford, I assume you were going to be leading the South Carolina delegation here in St. Paul. What are you hearing? What do you think should be done?SANFORD: Well, I'll leave that up to, you know, those in charge on that front as to exactly what will be done, but, I mean, it's a national convention. This sort of thing happens every once four years.And what needs to be remembered about any storm is we certainly send thoughts, we certainly send prayers. We're already in the process of sending aid.But this is a part of a national debate that we're having, a national conversation that we're having as Americans as to what comes next come the elections in November.And so whether it's moved back or whether it's held at, you know, the date that's planned, I don't know. But what I do know is this is part of a much larger debate that can't be disrupted at the end of the day by a storm, a tornado, a flood, you name it, because that election is going to take place come November.BLITZER: You're saying that debate over who should be the next president of the United States...SANFORD: Correct.BLITZER: ... whether it should be John McCain or Barack Obama. That's a huge debate. But some say, Congressman Cantor, you know, given this natural disaster that's about to take place, maybe it would be wise for both of these parties to put politics aside, at least right now, and focus in exclusively on the human side of this hurricane.CANTOR: You know, it's really up to John McCain. And I think that he has shown, in terms of being the head of our party going into this election, and the fact that a theme of this convention is putting country first, I know that John McCain has over a 20-year track record of doing just that.And so there's no question in my mind that he'll make the right call as to how we're going to proceed in St. Paul. He's made the right call every step of the way during this race. And I'm confident that the same will occur this week and that the country will have its priorities straight, making sure that the people in the gulf are safe. BLITZER: What's the reaction in South Carolina among your Republican base to Senator McCain's surprise decision to pick Sarah Palin, the governor of Alaska, to be his running mate?SANFORD: Across the board, a lot of people are elated and excited.It's interesting. My wife was talking to a couple of girlfriends yesterday, and they were all keyed up about a woman they've never heard about, but very much loved her life story.SANFORD: The fact that you have somebody who begins in the PTA and cares about different things, and ends up governor of Alaska and now a vice presidential nominee is an exciting story, whether from a woman's perspective or from a policy person's perspective. If you look at her track record from a standpoint of challenging the status quo, which very much needs to be challenged in a place like Washington, D.C., or from the standpoint of stewardship, actually watching out for the taxpayer dollar, I mean, I think it's telling that you had somebody that turned away a $400 million bridge to nowhere because she says that's not a good use of taxpayer resources.BLITZER: All right. Governor, we've got to leave it right there. Governor Sanford, Congressman Cantor. The president of the United States is over at FEMA headquarters and he's been speaking there, and we're getting the tape in right now. So I want to listen to the president of the United States.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: Here at FEMA headquarters, where I just received a briefing. I've also come to thank the people behind me for working the long hours that they're doing to make sure that we've got the preparations in place for Hurricane Gustav.There has been a lot of work done to get ready for the storm. Across the Gulf Coast, there's governors and state officials and local leaders that are taking this storm very seriously and are preparing proactively.Secretary Chertoff and FEMA Administrator Paulison report that the federal government has prepositioned teams of emergency managers, doctors, ambulances, search-and-rescue teams, aircraft and commodities throughout the region. There are millions of meals and millions of liters of water prestaged, as well as a lot of blankets and cots.In other words, there's a lot of preparation that had gone into the anticipation of this storm.We're working with governors to identify and secure out-of-state shelter for people in the path of the storm. Several states, including Missouri, Texas, and New Mexico are preparing to and have accepted a lot of evacuees. People are leaving those areas that are of concern, and we're working hard to make sure that they have a place to go.The Army Corps of Engineers informs me that while the levees are stronger than they've ever been, people across the Gulf Coast, especially in New Orleans, need to understand that in a storm of this size, there is serious risk of significant flooding.My message to the people of the Gulf Coast is this storm is dangerous. There's a real possibility of flooding, storm surge, and high winds. Therefore, it is very important for you to follow the instructions and direction of state and local officials. Do not put yourself in harm's way or make rescue workers take unnecessary risk. And know that the American people stand with you and that we'll face this emergency together.In the coming days, I encourage people across our nation to help their neighbors in need and contribute to charities, such the Red Cross. You can volunteer your time to help those in need. And of course, you can pray for those who might be suffering.In light of these events, I will not be going to Minnesota for the Republican National Convention. I'm going to travel down to Texas tomorrow to visit with the emergency operations center in Austin, where coordination among federal, state, and local government officials is occurring. I intend to go down to San Antonio, where state and local officials are prepositioning relief materials for Texas and Louisiana, and I'll have a chance to visit with residents of both states who have been evacuated.I will not be traveling to Louisiana tomorrow, because I do not want my visit to impede in any way the response of our emergency personnel.I've been talking to the governors, yesterday and today. I also spoke with Mayor Nagin of New Orleans to make sure that they're getting everything they need from the federal government to prepare for what all anticipate will be a difficult situation.I hope to be able to get to Louisiana as soon as conditions permit.This nation has come to know the strong and resilient spirit of the people of the Gulf Coast. They've made it through great challenges in the past and they're going to make it through this one as well. In the meantime, all those preparing for this storm are in our thoughts and our prayers from me, and Laura, and our whole nation.Thank you very much.(END VIDEOTAPE)BLITZER: And so there he is, the president of the United States at FEMA headquarters, announcing he's heading off to Texas to help monitor what's going on and will get to the scene as soon as he can. This is always a difficult proposition for a president, because on the one hand, you want to be there and see what's going on, and on the other hand, you don't want to disrupt important emergency activities that are going on.John King is here. This is quite a contrast from three years ago, when the president was on vacation as Katrina was moving forward and he basically flew over. You remember that picture of him looking out of Air Force One, flying over Katrina. They're deliberately and anxiously taking a very aggressive, active step right now. The president canceling his trip here to St. Paul to address this convention.KING: A very different tone and a very different assessment from all of the federal officials. That picture is actually interesting, if you go back and look at it. President Bush looked out the window. They took that picture from Air Force One. He did not want to land at that time because he thought he would take so much of the law enforcement and security personnel and be a distraction, so that picture is actually unfair.However, the overall federal response, everybody would concede from the White House on down, was beyond disappointing. It was horrible. As was -- many people criticized state and local officials. But that picture became a metaphor for it. The picture itself was actually a smart decision by the president not to put Air Force One on the ground at a time that he would distract so much attention. But it became part of the greater narrative, which was a huge federal failure.BLITZER: We're getting some live pictures in from New Orleans right now. We'll take another quick break and continue our coverage. Hurricane Gustav, it's moving towards New Orleans and the Gulf Coast on this, the third anniversary of Katrina. It's a powerful Category 3 monster right now. It could go up to a 4 or 5. ""Late Edition"" continues right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: Welcome back to St. Paul, where this Republican convention very much up in the air right now.Bill Bennett, our contributor, is joining us. You're not shy. Give these Republicans, your fellow Republicans, Bill, some advice. What should they do about this four-day convention, which is supposed to begin tomorrow?BILL BENNETT, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Well, be careful, because this may be a bigger hurricane than Katrina, we understand. I heard Mayor Nagin say last time, I urged you to leave, this time I'm telling you, get your butts out of town. So this is obviously very serious. And it's another opportunity, I should say, for the federal government to respond, and hopefully respond in a better way.BENNETT: But John McCain has to be very sensitive to what the suffering might be in New Orleans, so I think the possibility of canceling a day or two days or day-and-a-half is very real.BLITZER: We're maybe an hour away from some sort of formal announcement, is that right, John?KING: Yes. We know they've made some tentative decisions. They want Senator McCain to sign off on them. He is on his way down to the Gulf Coast area. If I'm right, Mississippi is his first stop.I'm told the leading proposal is to shorten the convention by a day or so. They have to gavel it into order tomorrow, or else legally they cannot nominate John McCain for president. So they will gavel the program in on Monday. They may shorten the Monday program, but they do need to convene the convention officially.And then I'm told the leading proposal is to shorten it for a day, and a lot of people around here are being told that day would be Tuesday, when they think you'll have the most impact with the storm and then a recovery effort under way, and perhaps ask the delegates here to participate in some service to help out, pitch in in a relief effort.But we're waiting for the final decisions. There's no doubt there will be significant changes. And it looks like we'll have a shorter official program maybe by a day, maybe by a bit more. We'll know soon.BLITZER: The -- it's going to be shorter obviously because the president of the United States and the vice president of the United States, they're not coming here. They were supposed to both address this convention tomorrow. These are difficult decisions that these party organizers, Gloria have to make.BORGER: Sure. Because, don't forget, this has been planned for years, no matter who the nominee was going to be. But I think everybody understands that there has to be a tonal shift.Conventions are celebrations, they're parties, people wear silly hats and buttons and everything else. And I think, you know, when you have a crisis going on in the country, I think what John was saying, which is essentially, turn this into some kind of telethon or fund- raising opportunity, is something that is really being talked about.BLITZER: And they might want to think about doing that not only for the 20,000 or so folks who were planning on coming here to St. Paul, but nationally, nationwide, because there is going to be a lot of need for help as a result of this...BORGER: And you'll have coverage.BLITZER: ...monster.BORGER: You'll have coverage.BLITZER: All right. Let's take another quick break and continue our coverage on the other side. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: Let's go right to Reynolds Wolf and get an update on Hurricane Gustav as it moves through the Gulf of Mexico, towards the Gulf Coast, New Orleans, right in the bull's eye.What do we know?WOLF: The latest we know, Wolf, is that winds are still at 120 miles per hour, gusting to 150. It's about 400 miles from New Orleans. We've been telling you all morning long about people evacuating. And we now have word from FEMA that there have been many people that have been leaving Louisiana, going into Mississippi. And they have been clogging the roadways, pulling their FEMA trailers.Now what FEMA would like you to do, is if you happen to have a FEMA trailer, leave it. All you need to do is get yourself, your prized possessions, and just leave the coastline. Your trailers can be replaced, your life cannot.The storm is still expected to march its way to the west- northwest, doing so at a rate of about 17 miles an hour. It may increase in speed, Wolf, but it may also increase in power, going to Category 4 status as we get into Monday. Then at some point tomorrow, expect it to make landfall.Right now the forecast path has it just to the southwest of New Orleans, coming onshore. And as we get into Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, the storm going from a tremendous wind storm and rainstorm, and of course the storm surge, into a big rainmaker for parts of Texas, Louisiana, where this could be a big flood threat into much of next week.So it's going to be a tremendous story that we're going to follow here at CNN. Of course, we're your hurricane headquarters. We'll keep you up to speed with the latest information. Back to you.BLITZER: Yes. We're not going to leave this story at all. A quick thought, Bill Bennett, what do you want to hear? What's the most important thing John McCain should be saying? We're about to hear from him pretty soon. He's in Mississippi.BENNETT: John McCain is a guy with a right sense of mission and purpose. The whole theme of John McCain's life is live for something larger than yourself. He was bugging George Bush about this after 9/11. He was bugging George Bush about this after Katrina. And he was -- he has been doing this for years.So I think -- I don't think there's any posturing in John McCain's standing up and saying, now it's time for all of us to pitch in. This is what his life has been.BLITZER: Bill Bennett is going to be here with us. Gloria is here. John King is here. We're not going far away. We expect some kind of formal announcement from the RNC, from the Republican Convention here in St. Paul, Minnesota, within an hour, maybe less, maybe a little bit more. Once that happens, we'll share that with you.If there's a news conference, we'll bring it to you live. We'll be watching all of this very closely. I'm Wolf Blitzer in St. Paul. ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" starts at the top of the hour."	1.0

Anthony List, announced a $50,000 radio ad buy targeting Virginia gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe for his opposition to common ground abortion center health and safety standards. Last year, the Virginia Health Commissioner reported to the Board of Health that more than 80 violations were discovered in abortion centers across the Commonwealth. The ad will run on Adult and Soft Contemporary and Newstalk stations in the Northern Virginia, Richmond and Norfolk media markets for two weeks. “In light of Kermit Gosnell’s ‘house of horrors,’ it is an outrage that anyone who purports to care about women would oppose efforts to ensure that Virginia women are treated with basic dignity and respect. More than 80 violations have been discovered in Virginia abortion clinics including blood-stained equipment and operating tables, improper disposal of fetal remains, staff failure to properly sanitize instruments, and even doctors performing exams with unwashed hands,” said Mallory Quigley, spokesperson for Women Speak Out Virginia. “Despite evidence that these common ground health and safety standards are needed, Terry McAuliffe refuses to defect from his abortion industry allies, who have vigorously fought these pro-woman efforts from the beginning. The Women Speak Out Virginia PAC will be calling out Terry McAuliffe’s shameful opposition to protecting Virginia’s women until Election Day.”A script of the radio ad follows:In the race for Governor…there’s one candidate who has taken extreme positions far outside the mainstream….one candidate whose radical ideas are troubling to every woman in Virginia.It’s Terry McAuliffe.Just this month Terry McAuliffe opposed basic health and safety standards for some women’s health clinics that perform abortions.McAuliffe refuses to require women’s health clinics to provide the same sanitary environment we expect of dental offices and hospitals.McAuliffe is bowing to the political pressure from powerful corporations that run women’s health clinics.They must think they are above the law. They put their own interests above the health of safety of their patients.Virginia women’s clinics have been cited for unsanitary conditions, poor staff training, and poorly maintained equipment.But Terry McAuliffe is afraid to stand up for women’s health. He’s afraid to stand up for you.Career politician Terry McAuliffe is too extreme for Virginia.Paid for by Women Speak Out Virginia. Not authorized by any candidate or candidate’s committee.Last month, McAuliffe’s campaign was asked by the Washington Post to confirm or deny his stance on abortion as being one of supporting “a platform of abortion on-demand at any time, for any reason, paid for by Virginia taxpayers,” including “sex-selective abortion, late-term abortion, partial-birth abortion, and abortions on teenage girls without parental consent – all paid for by Virginia taxpayers.” McAuliffe spokesman Josh Schwerin declined to comment to the Post.Women Speak Out Virginia is an affiliated PAC of the Susan B. Anthony List. The SBA List and its affiliated Political Action Committees are dedicated to pursuing policies and electing candidates who will reduce and ultimately end abortion. To that end, the SBA List emphasizes the education, promotion, mobilization, and election of pro-life women. The SBA List is a network of more than 365,000 pro-life Americans nationwide.	1.0

But Sen. Rob Portman mentioned one that was new to us during a conference call with reporters.He was actually talking about student loans, but in answer to a question from WSPD radio in Toledo, Portman said:""The truth is, by the way, you know part of the health care bill is paid for by the administration taking the difference of what (interest rate) they can borrow at, and what most students pay, and putting some of that money into the health care bill.""He repeated that ""we took from students and paid for a new entitlement program we can't afford."" And he rephrased it by saying ""the health care bill was paid for in part by taking money out of the student loan system.""Portman’s comments, made April 28, were in support of a Republican proposal to extend low-interest student loan rates (3.4 percent) for another year. Republican lawmakers would do that by taking money out of the 2010 health care law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Specifically, the money would come from a fund in the health bill that covers prevention and public health.We’re not here to debate whether that’s good policy. But Portman, acknowledging Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander’s leadership role in the GOP proposal, suggested something fresh to our ears: the notion that Obamacare, as it is commonly called, used student loan money.PolitiFact Ohio decided to learn more.Students once were considered a poor lending risk. To prime the pump and expand educational opportunities, the federal government in 1965 decided to guarantee student loans against default. The government also guaranteed a certain interest rate to the banks, even if the rates students paid were lower. And the government paid additional fees to the banks for administration and collection of student loans.This wound up providing a lucrative revenue stream for the banks, while putting millions of Americans through college.But the system required billions of dollars in federal subsidies, and some in Washington, especially Democrats, started looking at alternatives. What if the government cut out the middle man (the banks) and gave loans directly to students through their colleges’ financial aid offices? Those offices already helped process most loans anyway. By getting rid of the subsidies, the government could save billions and use the money for more financial aid for needy students, Democrats said.Various pilot programs were tried. Some universities, including Ohio State, said they liked dealing directly with the government. But plenty of others liked the special attention private lenders gave them, and the private lenders spent millions lobbying Congress to keep the subsidy system.This debate dragged on for years. Then in early 2010, Democrats found the opening they needed to permanently move away from subsidizing the lenders. It coincided with passage of the Affordable Care Act.The Senate generally needs 60 votes to overcome filibusters and objections to legislation. Democrats lacked that number. So they decided to employ a seldom-used tactic involving budgets and government spending, known as ""reconciliation."" Reconciliation only requires 51 votes. That’s how Senate Democrats were able to pass a combined student loan-health care bill, the Reconciliation Act of 2010, on March 25, 2010, with 56 votes.You might not have heard much about the student loan portion at the time, because health care, a monumental social initiative, consumed most of the oxygen in Washington. But the two were connected through the reconciliation bill, which is where we come back to Portman’s claim.Did one component, student loans, help pay for health care? The answer is not as simple as it sounds.According to the Congressional Budget Office, the government was going to save $58 billion from the student loan program, over a 10-year period, by eliminating the middle man. That would provide enough money to put an additional $36 billion into Pell grants and $3 billion more into several other programs, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Even after these investments, the government would have $19 billion left, the CBO said.So was this $19 billion going into Obamacare? That’s what Portman’s press secretary, Christine Mangi, initially suggested when we first asked about Portman’s statement.The problem with that assumption is that the CBO did not show it that way.It showed the $19 billion as savings, or a net reduction in the federal deficit. And several budget experts we spoke with said that’s exactly where the $19 billion was going.The CBO also showed $124 billion in additional savings from the health care portion of the reconciliation act, thanks to new revenue, taxes and projected savings on Medicare. Mangi was skeptical of this projection, as are other Republicans, saying the health care provisions are certain to cost much more than assumed in 2010, wiping out any savings. Where will the money come from then?It’ll come in part from the money the government got by changing its student-loan program, she said. She also noted that some private lenders used to provide interest-rate reductions for borrowers, and new borrowers won’t have that option. That’s speculation, however, and such private-bank incentives to students became fewer after the 2008 financial crisis. Still, we sought out budget and education officials on this, and then we called Alexander’s office.Alexander was secretary of education under President George H. W. Bush. His staff referred us to other CBO figures, but that just led to more dispute among budget experts over how to interpret the numbers. But then we found agreement -- from two key Senate offices on opposite sides of the aisle.Alexander’s office drew our attention to a statement made by Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, a leader on education issues. On March 23, 2010, on the Senate floor Harkin said that by ending the subsidies to banks, the government would have more money for Pell grants and historically black colleges. He also said that $10 billion would go for debt reduction.Notice that he said $10 billion? But wait -- wasn’t it supposed to be $19 billion, according to the CBO figures? So where did the other $9 billion go?It went to pay for a portion of health care reform, Alexander’s staff insisted.We turned to the staff of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which Harkin chairs. And at last, there was common ground. Harkin indeed said $10 billion would go for debt reduction. The other $9 billion, said committee spokeswoman Justine Sessions, went to help pay for expansion of community health centers, prescription drug access, and consumer protections in insurance.That’s $9 billion for health care out the student loan program.With that, we return to Portman’s claim -- that health care reform ""was paid for in part by taking money out of the student loan system.""Portman’s statement is partially accurate. The overall health care bill has hundreds of billions in features before revenue and tax offsets bring the costs down, if projections prove to be right. We’re not here to debate whether they will. Nine billion dollars is a tiny share. But Portman said ""in part,"" and that $9 billion is destined for health care, so he’s right there.But he suggested this is at the expense of students. That’s a big leap, leaving out important detail and context. The combined student loan-health care bill did not reduce the amount of money that students can borrow. It actually expanded the amount of money available for student aid. What it reduced is the banks’ share.""The money that was saved wasn't money that was going into education -- it was money that was subsidizing private banks,"" Sessions, of the education committee, said in an email. ""Period.""On the Truth-O-Meter, Portman’s claim rates Half True.Advertisement"	1.0

The Paris attacks last November killed 130 people and seriously injured hundreds more. The Brussels attacks last week killed more than 30 people and struck at the heart of NATO. Americans were among the victims of both attacks as the terrorists do not differentiate between us and our close allies.One of the causes of this horror has been European bureaucrats restraining law enforcement from fully engaging with the Muslim community in “no go” zones. As a result, for years, a radical, theocratic, violent ideology has spread in some mosques and Muslim neighborhoods throughout Europe. Terrorists have exploited these isolated enclaves to recruit followers, formulate plots and orchestrate attacks.BRATTON RIPS CRUZ AGAIN OVER PROPOSALTO MONITOR MUSLIMSThere is no better example of these “no go” zones than one neighborhood in the city of this latest horrific attack — the municipality of Molenbeek in the city of Brussels. In attack after attack, from 9/11 to Madrid to Paris to Brussels, the trail seems to come back repeatedly to Molenbeek. At least three of the terrorists of the November 2015 Paris attack grew up and lived there. In fact, one of the key terrorists of the Paris attack, Salah Abdeslam, fled back to Molenbeek where he knew he could find sanctuary. It is telling that Abdeslam effectively hid in plain sight there for weeks in the same city as the headquarters of NATO and the European Union.Even Belgium’s own Prime Minister, Charles Michel, has admitted after the Paris attacks that “[A]lmost every time there’s a link with Molenbeek . . . It’s been a form of laissez faire and laxity. Now we’re paying the bill.”Many European leaders are now recognizing that passively allowing the Islamist threat to fester was a serious error. We cannot make the same mistakes in America.NYPD TERRORISM CHIEF: TED CRUZ 'CAMPAIGNING THROUGH FEAR' In the wake of the Brussels attacks, I called for vigorously guarding against the political correctness that has plagued Europe. I also called for empowering law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they follow the path of Molenbeek and become havens for radical Islamic terrorists.The response was predictable. Liberal politicians, including President Obama, Hillary Clinton and Mayor de Blasio, all loudly denounced my approach. Indeed, they seemed far more outraged at my calling for us to prevent radical Islamic terrorism then they were at the terrorists who attacked in Brussels. In high dudgeon, they insist we must remain willfully blind to the root causes of these attacks.The Islamic State “is not Islamic,” President Obama absurdly tells us.New York Daily News front pages on the presidential electionEveryone knows that’s nonsense. Of course, there are many peaceful Muslims in America, and hundreds of millions across the world, who can be our allies in this global battle. But we cannot fight and win without identifying and confronting the enemy. Islamism is a political and theocratic philosophy that commands its adherents to wage jihad, to murder or forcibly convert the infidels (by which they mean everyone else). Islamism is the enemy, and it must be defeated.To do so, we must take a risk-based approach that focuses resources on the enclaves and potential hotbeds of radicalization where terrorists are likely to thrive. Just as with law enforcement’s successful efforts against gangs or drug dealers or the Mafia, we need resources and informants and undercover officers placed where terrorists are likely to be. We need lawful surveillance operations. And we need far more engagement between law enforcement and members of Muslim communities who are committed to working to rid their neighborhoods of the scourge of terrorism.In the wake of 9/11, there was a broad consensus in favor of a common-sense domestic counterterrorism strategy. But over the last seven years, the focus on protecting the homeland has been lost. The Obama administration has even joined Islamist governments in sponsoring a UN resolution that would shred our First Amendment by threatening to make discussion of radical Islamism potentially illegal. And now we are seeing the erosion of our counterterrorism tools here at home, even while we know from successful attacks from Boston to San Bernardino that terrorists are still plotting to strike America.A prime case study is here in New York City. Under Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Commissioner Ray Kelly, the NYPD started a counterterrorism unit that tracked demographic trends in New York City to provide investigators with important information about where terrorists might congregate and recruit. That sophisticated analysis can be a critical part of counterterrorism efforts to prevent an attack before it occurs or disrupt burgeoning terror cells. That unit likely saved lives.For example, a former director of intelligence analysis for the NYPD, Mitchell Silber, explained that the unit identified the Islamic Books and Tapes bookstore in Brooklyn as a venue for radicalization, and “provided a predicate for an investigation that thwarted a 2004 plot against the Herald Square subway station.” Moreover, the Obama administration’s counterterrorism advisor and now CIA director, John Brennan, stated the administration knew about this unit and referred to its work as “exceptionally good.” Indeed, while running for mayor in 2013, even then-candidate Bill de Blasio said he believed the unit was legal and was created in good faith to protect New Yorkers.Once elected mayor, however, de Blasio shut down that counterterrorism unit. He was taking heat from liberal advocacy groups who caricatured the unit’s work as “spying on Muslims,” which it wasn’t. New Yorkers, including the Muslim community, are less safe as a result.After the Brussels attacks, I called out the de Blasio administration for its shortsighted capitulation to its liberal allies at the expense of the safety and security of the people of New York. In response, Commissioner Bill Bratton penned an op-ed attacking my policy in this newspaper. He did not say that the work of the unit was misguided or a failure. Instead, he alleged, remarkably, that the unit “was finished” with its work and “it wasn’t serving any useful purpose.”Bratton has a difficult job, and I am grateful for all he does to keep the people of New York safe. I also understand that politically, he has no choice but to implement the de Blasio-Obama liberal agenda. But his explanation for dismantling the unit makes no sense; it ignores the nature of the threat that we face from radical Islam.Simply put, demographic trends are not static. They are dynamic. They change over time. The pockets of New York City that are fertile grounds for terrorist recruitment today may not be fertile grounds next year, and places without a significant radical presence right now may become hotbeds of terrorist activity in the future. To say that the work of a vital intelligence unit “was finished” is not plausible. It is the excuse of an administration grasping for anything to justify what was obviously a surrender to political correctness.Hitting back(Alex Wong/Getty Images)Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Mayor Michael Bloomberg have both stated they believe the unit was lawful and effective, and should not have been shut down.The de Blasio administration is trying to avoid the ideological foundation of the war radical Islamic terrorists are waging against us. While Bratton admits that the jihadists are driven by ideology, he astonishingly maintains that our response should have “no ideological component whatsoever.”That’s ridiculous. If the terrorist threat is driven by radical Islamic ideology, then we must take account of that ideology in countering the threat: To “stop the terrorists before they strike,” we must understand what their motivation and goals are, where they might plot attacks and which targets they are inclined to strike. Their ideology tells us how they might peddle their radical Islamism in our cities and towns and helps us encourage our fellow Muslim citizens to choose a different path.The hollow argument that ideology has no role in counterterrorism leaves no doubt that politics is afoot here.I repeat my call for de Blasio to repudiate the dangerous confines of political correctness and reinstate this important unit as the first step towards a more proactive, hard-headed counterterrorism strategy on the home front.The bottom line is that to defeat radical Islam, we need to focus our counterterrorism resources where terrorists are likely to be. That’s not profiling or spying. It’s common sense.An investigation of Wall Street fraud wouldn’t focus on community banks in the outer boroughs. If we want to defeat radical Islam, we need to focus on areas that are at risk of being infiltrated by jihadists.The vast majority of Muslim Americans are law-abiding citizens. Indeed, patriotic American Muslims have provided critical assistance to our law-enforcement, intelligence and military officials to detect and disrupt jihadist plots. And we need their help in the war on terrorism.These are dangerous times. If I am elected President, every American will have a commander in chief fiercely committed to defeating radical Islamic terrorism. This is a battle we must win. If we don’t want to become Europe, we need to put aside the political correctness, focus our efforts on stopping radicalization and do what needs to be done to keep America safe.Cruz, U.S. senator from Texas, is running for the Republican nomination for President.Sign up for BREAKING NEWS Emails	1.0

Please let me know if you need any additional clarification. Carolyn Hodges, TFRW President: We sought information from many sources and immigration groups across the nation to find a high and low number. While working with the groups, there were widely varied estimates. Because the range of numbers is so broad, we hoped to use the broadest of numbers so that we could get down to the point of finding smart solutions, not just more disagreement. Here is an example of the difficulty in estimating the number: The “residual method” is widely used to estimate the undocumented population of the USA. With this method, the known number of legal immigrants to the United States is subtracted from the reported U.S. Census number of self-proclaimed foreign born people to obtain the total, unauthorized immigrant (residual) population.[2] This methodology is used by the US Department of Homeland Security,[3] the Pew Hispanic Center, the US Census Bureau and others. Since undocumented immigrants have many reasons for not answering the U.S. Census correctly and since there are no penalties for answering the U.S. Census incorrectly, a direct subtraction is a well-known source of undercount error and has to be corrected. All known users of this methodology correct the foreign born population (about 35–50 million) by 10–40% (3–12 million) to account for this undercount effect. Critics claim this correction is in error no matter which size correction is used. (Jeffery Passel, Unauthorized Migrants: Numbers and Characteristics , Pew Hispanic Center, June 2005; Michael Hoefer and Christopher Campbell, Estimates of the Unauthorized Immigrant Population Residing in the United States: May 2006 , US Department of Homeland Security, Office of Immigration Statistics, Policy Directorate, January 2005) From: <Selby>, ""Gardner (CMG-Austin)"" <wgselby@statesman.com>Date: Friday, January 25, 2013 3:08 PMTo: Laura SorrellThanks, Laura. Where did the group field the 9 million and 50 million figures?326 pmJan. 25, 2013The example provided below there is a large margin of error when figuring out the number using the residual data method. Because the number varies from each report you see when browsing for the figure, it was clear that there is no correct number. Even the government agencies (US Dept. Homeland Security and the Census Bureau) agree that the margin of error can range anywhere from 10%-40% more than what is actually published. Again, the point is to show that no one knows the actual number and that is why TFRW is offering a smart solution to the issue, instead of just continuing the disagreement.4 pmJan. 29, 2013The 50 million source TFRW used was Joan Neuhaus Schaan, who at the time of speaking with TFRW, was the Fellow for Homeland Security & Terrorism Programs at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University.1151 amJan. 31, 2013The 50 million source TFRW used was Joan Neuhaus Schaan, who at the time of speaking with TFRW, was the Fellow for Homeland Security & Terrorism Programs at the James A.

Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University.1153 amThe point was to show you're using sources that people do not view as credible. Sorry about not providing the source for the 9 million. Thought you had already proven that number to be correct on your own. Here are some sources below: The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that there are 8 to 9 million ""undocumented workers,"" as they are often called, in the U.S., and each year the number goes up by about 500,000. Other estimates are much higher. …the official number put out by the U.S. Census of 9 million… Again, the point of the resolution was to not get bogged down with the numbers, but to prove a point that no one knows what the actual numbers are. The overall resolution is to show that the real discussion should be about the policy and overall reform — not specific numbers.From: <Selby>, ""Gardner (CMG-Austin)"" <wgselby@statesman.com>Date: Friday, February 1, 2013 12:12 PMTo: Laura Sorrell I rechecked with the census bureau. It has made no estimates. Let me know if you have a source for the 9 million figure? "	1.0

Photo: AP Photo/John HellerLabor Day is traditionally a time for picnics and parades. But this year is no picnic for American workers, and a protest march would be more appropriate than a parade.Not only are 25 million unemployed or underemployed, but American companies continue to cut wages and benefits. The median wage is still dropping, adjusted for inflation. High unemployment has given employers extra bargaining leverage to wring out wage concessions.All told, it’s been the worst decade for American workers in a century. According to Commerce Department data, private-sector wage gains over the last decade have even lagged behind wage gains during the decade of the Great Depression (4 percent over the last ten years, adjusted for inflation, versus 5 percent from 1929 to 1939). Big American corporations are making more money, and creating more jobs, outside the United States than in it. Big American corporations are making more money, and creating more jobs, outside the United States than in it. If corporations are people, as the Supreme Court’s twisted logic now insists, most of the big ones headquartered here are rapidly losing their American identity.CEO pay, meanwhile, has soared. The median value of salaries, bonuses and long-term incentive awards for CEOs at 350 big American companies surged 11 percent last year to $9.3 million (according to a study of proxy statements conducted for The Wall Street Journal by the management consultancy Hay Group.). Bonuses have surged 19.7 percent.This doesn’t even include all those stock options rewarded to CEOs at rock-bottom prices in 2008 and 2009. Stock prices have ballooned since then, the current downdraft notwithstanding. In March, 2009, for example, Ford CEO Alan Mulally received a grant of options and restricted shares worth an estimated $16 million at the time. But Ford is now showing large profits – in part because the UAW agreed to allow Ford to give its new hires roughly half the wages of older Ford workers – and its share prices have responded. Mulally’s 2009 grant is now worth over $200 million.The ratio of corporate profits to wages is now higher than at any time since just before the Great Depression. The ratio of corporate profits to wages is now higher than at any time since just before the Great Depression. Meanwhile, the American economy has all but stopped growing – in large part because consumers (whose spending is 70 percent of GDP) are also workers whose jobs and wages are under assault.Perhaps there would still be something to celebrate on Labor Day if government was coming to the rescue. But Washington is paralyzed, the president seems unwilling or unable to take on labor-bashing Republicans, and several Republican governors are mounting direct assaults on organized labor (see Indiana, Ohio, Maine and Wisconsin, for example).So let’s bag the picnics and parades this Labor Day. American workers should march in protest. They’re getting the worst deal they’ve had since before Labor Day was invented – and the economy is suffering as a result.Published by arrangement with RobertReich.org .Robert Reich is Chancellor’s Professor of Public Policy at the University of California at Berkeley.

Keith Ashdown, the spokesman and chief sloganeer for a watchdog group, had been stewing about how to describe Alaska's Gravina Island Bridge in a news release. He wanted a catchy phrase that expressed the huge cost and dubious need for the milelong span. Then, as he stood beneath a Miller Lite sign at a bar called the Hawk 'n' Dove, he had a brainstorm. ""Bridge to nowhere!"" Four years later, the phrase has done what few political slogans can do. It shaped public opinion, influenced an election and pressured Congress to change its rules. Mentioned hundreds of times in newspapers, on TV and at countless dinner tables, it became shorthand for political pork and a Congress that was out of touch. ""It was an extraordinarily powerful image,"" said Rep. Adam Putnam, R-Bartow. ""It became a metaphor for a Republican majority that had lost its way on fiscal responsibility."" Language columnist William Safire called it ""the phrase that launched a thousand editorials."" Columnist George Will wrote after the November election: ""Republicans now know where the bridge to nowhere leads: to the political wilderness."" This is the story of three words that changed American politics. 'Pillow-talk pork' Ashdown is an unlikely Washington power broker. He has never held elected office, he's not a lawyer and he rarely wears a tie. A stocky 34-year-old with a deep voice and a belly built by beer, he looks more linebacker than lobbyist. He works for Taxpayers for Common Sense, a Washington group that opposes corruption and government waste. He plays a unique role in the Washington power structure: part detective, part press agent. He gets tips about government shenanigans, verifies them, and then passes them to reporters with snappy quotes they can't resist. He described a project that helped a lawmaker's wife as ""pillow-talk pork"" and said Pentagon officials have ""spent money like Paris Hilton at a shoe sale."" Better than most in the nation's capital, Ashdown understands that the fewest words often say the most. That's why on that night at the bar in December 2002, he was determined to find just the right ones. The Golden Fleece He had learned of the Gravina Island Bridge a year earlier from an Alaskan environmentalist. He decided the $190-million bridge would be good for the Golden Fleece, a legendary award for dubious federal spending. The bridge would link the greater Ketchikan area, which has about 13,000 residents, with an island of 50 inhabitants that is home to the town's airport. It would replace a passenger ferry, but its main purpose was to encourage development on the island. ""It was really a bridge to the future of the community,"" said Blaine Ashcraft, executive director of the Greater Ketchikan Chamber of Commerce. Ashdown saw a boondoggle. His challenge was to make an obscure Alaskan bridge interesting, to find colorful words that would break through the din of messages competing for the public's attention. He was by no means the first to use the phrase ""bridge to nowhere."" It has been used for decades to describe unpopular bridges, including spans from Pittsburgh to Pensacola. On June 12, 2003, Ashdown issued a press release announcing the Golden Fleece award was going to Rep. Don Young, the Alaska Republican who sponsored the bridge. At first, it looked like the effort was off to a great start. Within hours, the Associated Press in Alaska published a story. But the phrase did not appear. Months went by. No one used the phrase. Ashdown was discouraged. All that work and all he had to show for it was one measly AP story. 'A little oinker' In the spring of 2004, Ashdown got a call from Timothy Egan of the New York Times, who was writing a story about the Gravina bridge and another one known as Knik Arm in Anchorage. During several interviews with Egan, Ashdown said ""bridge to nowhere"" at least 40 times. Egan's story, ""Built With Steel, Perhaps, but Greased With Pork,"" ran on the front page of the Times on Saturday, April 10, 2004. It marked the media debut of the phrase Ashdown, in Paragraph 16: ""It's a gold-plated bridge to nowhere ..."" and it portrayed the bridge as part of a money-grab by Alaska's congressional delegation. Egan quoted Young, who chaired the powerful transportation committee, boasting that he wanted to be ""a little oinker."" Once again, it looked like Ashdown's phrase was about to take off. The next day, on Meet the Press, when Sen. John McCain was asked about boosting military spending without increasing the deficit, he complained about ""bridges to nowhere in Alaska."" But again it fell flat. Despite Ashdown's salesmanship, the bridge to nowhere wasn't ready for prime time. The span was merely a proposal and had not been approved by Congress. The 2004 presidential campaign was dominating the news and voters weren't especially bothered about political pork. Smoking pot? In the summer of 2005, when Congress began considering a highway bill, there was an uptick of interest in the bridge. Journalists repeated the phrase in stories that skewered the pork-laden bill. At this point, Alaska leaders might have been able to quash the controversy if they had given a cogent defense of the bridge. The state had been blessed with two lawmakers who had the clout to get millions for the bridge - Young and Sen. Ted Stevens. But they also happened to be two of the most mercurial lawmakers in the U.S. Capitol. As criticism mounted, Young, who had boasted that he stuffed the bill ""like a turkey,"" told the Associated Press that, ""These people keep saying it's nowhere, they're just smoking pot."" The opposition was gaining ground, but not quickly enough. Congress passed Young's highway bill, with the bridge tucked inside. On Aug. 10, the president signed it into law. The tale of Ashdown's phrase might have ended here. But two stories gave it new life. Duke Cunningham, a California lawmaker under investigation, had drawn attention to congressional pork because he had earmarked money for a defense contractor in return for bribes. Then along came Hurricane Katrina. As cost estimates for the hurricane soared, lawmakers on Capitol Hill began looking for expensive federal projects that could be cut or delayed. The bridge to nowhere was the perfect target. 'Kiss my ear' Suddenly, Ashdown's phrase exploded in the media. In editorials, op-ed columns and TV news shows, the bridge was cited as a case study of federal priorities that were out of whack. As McCain said on CNN, ""Do the American people want their tax dollars to go to the victims of Hurricane Katrina - and now Rita - or do they want it to go to a bridge to nowhere?"" An editorial in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch groused about the highway bill ""larded with pork barrel public works projects like bridges to Nowhere, Alaska."" A letter to the editor of the Chattanooga Times Free Press declared that ""$200-million bridges to nowhere in Alaska and other outrageous pork projects have to be eliminated."" Young sneered at his critics' suggestion that he give back the money. ""They can kiss my ear,"" he said. In the Senate, Tom Coburn, R-Okla., proposed cutting federal money from the Gravina and Knik Arm bridges and directing much of it to repair a span in Louisiana damaged by the hurricane. Coburn said it was ""time for us to change our priorities."" Stevens, in an emotional, fist-pounding speech, said Coburn was attacking not the bridges, but Alaska itself. He thundered that it was wrong for a senator to steal another senator's pork. ""I will put the Senate on notice - and I don't kid people - if the Senate decides to discriminate against our state and take money only from our state, I will resign from this body."" Stevens defeated the amendment 82-15. But he hadn't stopped the growing furor around the nation. Pop status Three weeks later, Parade magazine, circulation 34-million, cemented the pop status for the bridge with a cover story titled, ""A Visit to The Bridge to Nowhere."" That marked a turning point when the phrase reached critical mass and began to have serious political consequences. Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., was so worried that he wrote to House Speaker Dennis Hastert warning that the phrase was damaging their party. ""Ask anyone what the 'bridges to nowhere' are and they will tell you they are a serious example of a Republican Congress bringing home some of the most expensive bacon in history on the taxpayers' dime,"" Flake wrote. Across the nation, in campaign events and town hall meetings, members of Congress heard a chorus of complaints about the bridge to nowhere. It seemed everyone knew about it. On the CBS-TV drama Threshold, one of the characters spoke derisively of the government paying for ""bridges to nowhere."" In the St. Petersburg Times, a letter to the editor used the phrase to lambast government funding for a bridge on the 15th hole at the Dunedin Country Club. Ashdown's phrase spawned imitators. There was the ""wall to nowhere"" (the border fence between the United States and Mexico), the ""runway to nowhere"" (at the St. Louis airport) and the ""railway to nowhere"" (a rail line in Mississippi). But Rep. Young, oblivious to the growing PR problem, scoffed at the criticism and disputed Flake's claim that the bridge was harming their party. ""He hasn't got any traction,"" Young told the Anchorage Daily News. ""He's a dog lying on ice right now: He's scratching a lot but he doesn't go anywhere."" In Ketchikan, community leaders were frustrated. In their view, the news media distorted the story, but they couldn't agree on how to respond and opted to say little. As a result, the national debate remained lopsided. The critics kept attacking, but Stevens, Young and the Ketchikan leaders failed to mount a forceful response. Collateral damage Congressional leaders had tried to quell the controversy by removing the earmarks for Gravina and Knik Arm from a spending bill, but they did not cut Alaska's transportation money by the same amount, so the state was still free to build the bridges with federal dollars. The phrase, fueled by the Parade cover story, a segment on ABC's 20/20 and countless mentions on talk radio, kept spreading. As the 2006 campaigns got underway, Flake's prediction was coming true: The bridge had become a serious political liability. Amazingly, a bridge to a tiny Alaska island was now an issue in House and Senate races in Rhode Island, Michigan, New York and Minnesota. It came up in debates and was a dependable attack line against Republican incumbents. Brian Riedl, an analyst with the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the phrase was as evocative as the $400 hammer that symbolized Pentagon waste in the 1980s. In Rhode Island, Republican Sen. Lincoln Chafee was pummeled from the right and the left for voting with Stevens on the bridge. The conservative Club for Growth ran TV ads that blasted him for supporting ""that bridge to nowhere boondoggle up in Alaska."" Chafee ended up losing his seat. Analysts say the bridge was a factor. Nationally, the phrase also played a role in the Democrats seizing control of Congress. The Iraq war and disapproval of President Bush were the main forces, but the strong public disapproval of the Republican Congress - fueled by the phrase Ashdown conceived in a bar four years earlier - played its part. Jennifer Duffy, an analyst with the Cook Political Report, said the phrase drove home the message, ""Republicans were not being good stewards of your tax dollars."" When the Democrats took over in January, their first order of business was to change House rules to require more disclosure of individual projects like bridges. The rule change reflected a remarkable cultural shift on Capitol Hill, that political pork was no longer universally popular. Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., said his party heard a clear message from the November elections: No more bills for special interests and ""no more bridges built to nowhere."" Epilogue Ashdown has become a minor celebrity in Washington and is introduced at cocktail parties as the guy who coined the phrase. He resists the notion that the bridge to nowhere is his masterpiece, hopeful that some day he'll dream up something even better. Friends often ask him to concoct a phrase for them. ""We need a title like a bridge to nowhere. Got anything?"" But despite his success in branding the slogan and changing public views on political pork, Congress is back to its old ways. To pass a spending bill a week ago, the Democratic leadership stuffed it with pork in true Don Young-Ted Stevens style. Ketchikan leaders still hope the bridge will go somewhere. But they fear state officials have lost their enthusiasm. The governor's new budget did not provide any money for the project. Ashcraft, of the Ketchikan chamber, says he's concerned that the state's elected officials ""are starting to grow weary of the battle.""

""It was really a bridge to the future of the community,"" said Blaine Ashcraft, executive director of the Greater Ketchikan Chamber of Commerce. Ashdown saw a boondoggle. His challenge was to make an obscure Alaskan bridge interesting, to find colorful words that would break through the din of messages competing for the public's attention. He was by no means the first to use the phrase ""bridge to nowhere."" It has been used for decades to describe unpopular bridges, including spans from Pittsburgh to Pensacola. On June 12, 2003, Ashdown issued a press release announcing the Golden Fleece award was going to Rep. Don Young, the Alaska Republican who sponsored the bridge. At first, it looked like the effort was off to a great start. Within hours, the Associated Press in Alaska published a story. But the phrase did not appear. Months went by. No one used the phrase. Ashdown was discouraged. All that work and all he had to show for it was one measly AP story. In the spring of 2004, Ashdown got a call from Timothy Egan of the New York Times, who was writing a story about the Gravina bridge and another one known as Knik Arm in Anchorage. During several interviews with Egan, Ashdown said ""bridge to nowhere"" at least 40 times. Egan's story, ""Built With Steel, Perhaps, but Greased With Pork,"" ran on the front page of the Times on Saturday, April 10, 2004. It marked the media debut of the phrase Ashdown, in Paragraph 16: ""It's a gold-plated bridge to nowhere ..."" and it portrayed the bridge as part of a money-grab by Alaska's congressional delegation. Egan quoted Young, who chaired the powerful transportation committee, boasting that he wanted to be ""a little oinker."" Once again, it looked like Ashdown's phrase was about to take off. The next day, on Meet the Press, when Sen. John McCain was asked about boosting military spending without increasing the deficit, he complained about ""bridges to nowhere in Alaska."" But again it fell flat. Despite Ashdown's salesmanship, the bridge to nowhere wasn't ready for prime time. The span was merely a proposal and had not been approved by Congress. The 2004 presidential campaign was dominating the news and voters weren't especially bothered about political pork. In the summer of 2005, when Congress began considering a highway bill, there was an uptick of interest in the bridge. Journalists repeated the phrase in stories that skewered the pork-laden bill. At this point, Alaska leaders might have been able to quash the controversy if they had given a cogent defense of the bridge. The state had been blessed with two lawmakers who had the clout to get millions for the bridge - Young and Sen. Ted Stevens. But they also happened to be two of the most mercurial lawmakers in the U.S. Capitol. As criticism mounted, Young, who had boasted that he stuffed the bill ""like a turkey,"" told the Associated Press that, ""These people keep saying it's nowhere, they're just smoking pot."" The opposition was gaining ground, but not quickly enough. Congress passed Young's highway bill, with the bridge tucked inside. On Aug. 10, the president signed it into law. The tale of Ashdown's phrase might have ended here. But two stories gave it new life. Duke Cunningham, a California lawmaker under investigation, had drawn attention to congressional pork because he had earmarked money for a defense contractor in return for bribes. Then along came Hurricane Katrina. As cost estimates for the hurricane soared, lawmakers on Capitol Hill began looking for expensive federal projects that could be cut or delayed. The bridge to nowhere was the perfect target. Suddenly, Ashdown's phrase exploded in the media. In editorials, op-ed columns and TV news shows, the bridge was cited as a case study of federal priorities that were out of whack. As McCain said on CNN, ""Do the American people want their tax dollars to go to the victims of Hurricane Katrina - and now Rita - or do they want it to go to a bridge to nowhere?"" An editorial in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch groused about the highway bill ""larded with pork barrel public works projects like bridges to Nowhere, Alaska."" A letter to the editor of the Chattanooga Times Free Press declared that ""$200-million bridges to nowhere in Alaska and other outrageous pork projects have to be eliminated."" Young sneered at his critics' suggestion that he give back the money. ""They can kiss my ear,"" he said. In the Senate, Tom Coburn, R-Okla., proposed cutting federal money from the Gravina and Knik Arm bridges and directing much of it to repair a span in Louisiana damaged by the hurricane. Coburn said it was ""time for us to change our priorities."" Stevens, in an emotional, fist-pounding speech, said Coburn was attacking not the bridges, but Alaska itself. He thundered that it was wrong for a senator to steal another senator's pork. ""I will put the Senate on notice - and I don't kid people - if the Senate decides to discriminate against our state and take money only from our state, I will resign from this body."" Stevens defeated the amendment 82-15. But he hadn't stopped the growing furor around the nation. Three weeks later, Parade magazine, circulation 34-million, cemented the pop status for the bridge with a cover story titled, ""A Visit to The Bridge to Nowhere."" That marked a turning point when the phrase reached critical mass and began to have serious political consequences. Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., was so worried that he wrote to House Speaker Dennis Hastert warning that the phrase was damaging their party. ""Ask anyone what the 'bridges to nowhere' are and they will tell you they are a serious example of a Republican Congress bringing home some of the most expensive bacon in history on the taxpayers' dime,"" Flake wrote. Across the nation, in campaign events and town hall meetings, members of Congress heard a chorus of complaints about the bridge to nowhere. It seemed everyone knew about it. On the CBS-TV drama Threshold, one of the characters spoke derisively of the government paying for ""bridges to nowhere."" In the St. Petersburg Times, a letter to the editor used the phrase to lambast government funding for a bridge on the 15th hole at the Dunedin Country Club. Ashdown's phrase spawned imitators. There was the ""wall to nowhere"" (the border fence between the United States and Mexico), the ""runway to nowhere"" (at the St. Louis airport) and the ""railway to nowhere"" (a rail line in Mississippi). But Rep. Young, oblivious to the growing PR problem, scoffed at the criticism and disputed Flake's claim that the bridge was harming their party. ""He hasn't got any traction,"" Young told the Anchorage Daily News. ""He's a dog lying on ice right now: He's scratching a lot but he doesn't go anywhere."" In Ketchikan, community leaders were frustrated. In their view, the news media distorted the story, but they couldn't agree on how to respond and opted to say little. As a result, the national debate remained lopsided. The critics kept attacking, but Stevens, Young and the Ketchikan leaders failed to mount a forceful response. Congressional leaders had tried to quell the controversy by removing the earmarks for Gravina and Knik Arm from a spending bill, but they did not cut Alaska's transportation money by the same amount, so the state was still free to build the bridges with federal dollars. The phrase, fueled by the Parade cover story, a segment on ABC's 20/20 and countless mentions on talk radio, kept spreading. As the 2006 campaigns got underway, Flake's prediction was coming true: The bridge had become a serious political liability. Amazingly, a bridge to a tiny Alaska island was now an issue in House and Senate races in Rhode Island, Michigan, New York and Minnesota. It came up in debates and was a dependable attack line against Republican incumbents. Brian Riedl, an analyst with the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the phrase was as evocative as the $400 hammer that symbolized Pentagon waste in the 1980s. In Rhode Island, Republican Sen. Lincoln Chafee was pummeled from the right and the left for voting with Stevens on the bridge. The conservative Club for Growth ran TV ads that blasted him for supporting ""that bridge to nowhere boondoggle up in Alaska."" Chafee ended up losing his seat. Analysts say the bridge was a factor. Nationally, the phrase also played a role in the Democrats seizing control of Congress. The Iraq war and disapproval of President Bush were the main forces, but the strong public disapproval of the Republican Congress - fueled by the phrase Ashdown conceived in a bar four years earlier - played its part. Jennifer Duffy, an analyst with the Cook Political Report, said the phrase drove home the message, ""Republicans were not being good stewards of your tax dollars."" When the Democrats took over in January, their first order of business was to change House rules to require more disclosure of individual projects like bridges. The rule change reflected a remarkable cultural shift on Capitol Hill, that political pork was no longer universally popular. Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., said his party heard a clear message from the November elections: No more bills for special interests and ""no more bridges built to nowhere."" Ashdown has become a minor celebrity in Washington and is introduced at cocktail parties as the guy who coined the phrase. He resists the notion that the bridge to nowhere is his masterpiece, hopeful that some day he'll dream up something even better. Friends often ask him to concoct a phrase for them. ""We need a title like a bridge to nowhere. Got anything?"" But despite his success in branding the slogan and changing public views on political pork, Congress is back to its old ways. To pass a spending bill a week ago, the Democratic leadership stuffed it with pork in true Don Young-Ted Stevens style. Ketchikan leaders still hope the bridge will go somewhere. But they fear state officials have lost their enthusiasm. The governor's new budget did not provide any money for the project. Ashcraft, of the Ketchikan chamber, says he's concerned that the state's elected officials ""are starting to grow weary of the battle.""

One sentence in a NYC couple’s suicide note tells the story of how so many Americans are feeling about health care these days. With premiums skyrocketing, it’s difficult to pay for healthcare even if you don’t have “medical issues” like this couple did. This is tragic and is symbolic of the desperation so many people are feeling right now.A Manhattan couple committed suicide just a few hours after Senate Republicans tried to pass a bill that would repeal Obamacare.But three members of their own party – including Sen. John McCain – voted against the bill and it failed to pass, keeping the Affordable Care Act in place for now.The couple jumped out of a window of a New York City office building together in desperation over their inability to afford their health care: ‘We both have medical issues, we just can’t afford the health care.’The incident happened early Friday morning on the corner of Madison Avenue and 33rd Street – just a block from the Empire State Building.A 53-year-old chiropractor and his 50-year-old wife jumped out of a window of their recently-closed ninth-floor office in the 17-story building.Their bodies were covered with white sheets once police arrived at the scene, shutting down the entire block to investigate.The couple left behind suicide notes in a ziploc bag, that also included their IDs. Police have not released their names yet, but a photo obtained by the New York Post shows part of the letter, and it identifies the woman as Patricia. The note was titled ‘We had a wonderful life’. A law enforcement source who spoke with the Post said the woman’s note said: ‘Our kids are upstairs, please take care of them’.The man left one behind too, which read: ‘We both have medical issues, we just can’t afford the health care.’The building that the couple jumped from includes offices for law and advertising firms, therapists offices and commercial space.No further information on the couple has been released. It’s unclear how many children they left behind.Perry Kim, 49, a worker at Pure Green, a juice shop on the same block, said that he was outside just after 5:30am this morning when he heard an ‘ahhh’ noise and saw two people fall from the top of the building.The man appeared to hit his head and the woman had suffered abdominal injuries. They landed face up to the sky.	1.0

Hurd was appointed to the committee and that he himself is the one who said he was quitting the committee to focus on other committees. If anyone mischaracterized the events - it's Rep. Hurd. I think any rational person would think that - if this was all a clerical error - then you would expect that to be stated in the letter. Instead of just saying it was a clerical error, he gave an entirely different reason. If anyone here was being dishonest, it's Rep. Hurd. But I would also add that I find it incredibly difficult to believe that Rep. Hurd and his staff only found out about the appointment from a committee press release on 1/23. The Congressional Record from the 1/13, the day that committees were announced, lists Hurd as being on the small biz cmte. It was announced on the House floor, approved by unanimous consent and printed in the record. Here's the link and I also attached as a pdf - http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?r114:3:./temp/~r114zfJ0fa:: That doesn't prove or disprove our statement but, considering how much anticipation there is for committee assignments, I find it completely implausible to believe that neither Rep. Hurd nor any member of his staff either saw the announcement on the House floor or read the congressional record. So perhaps he was appointed in error but this was not a typo on a press release - all the things we said were true - according the the record, he clearly was in fact appointed to the committee, and according to his own letter, he did resign and he did give as his reason a desire to focus on his other committees.	1.0

Burdick said she introduced similar legislation in 2011 but was unable to get a hearing on the bill.

""But if people can't go waltzing into a gun shop and buy a 50-round magazine, I think that is a positive step.""The draft of Burdick's bill would ban gun clips containing more than 10 rounds of ammunition. Burdick said she didn't think there was a legitimate use for average citizens to have higher capacity clips, and she said in her email to colleagues: Even hunters are restricted from using large capacity magazines: there is a five cartridge limit for large game hunting, and three for bird hunting.

This group included aliens convicted of hundreds of violent and serious crimes, including homicide, sexual assault, kidnapping, and aggravated assault. The list of crimes also includes more than 16,000 drunk or drugged driving convictions. The vast majority of these releases from ICE custody were discretionary, not required by law (in fact, in some instances, apparently contrary to law), nor the result of local sanctuary policies.The document reveals that the 36,007 convicted criminal aliens freed from ICE custody in many instances had multiple convictions. Among them, the 36,007 had nearly 88,000 convictions, including:193 homicide convictions (including one willful killing of a public official with gun)426 sexual assault convictions	1.0

In large measure because if local law enforcement begins to act like immigration enforcement officers, what that means is that you will have people not reporting crimes. You will have people hiding from the police. And I think that is a real direct threat to the personal safety and security of all the citizens. So this is a result of the failure of the federal government, and that’s where it needs to be fixed.Russert: But you would allow the sanctuary cities to disobey the federal law.Clinton: “Well, I don’t think there is any choice. The ICE groups go in and raid individuals, but if you’re a local police chief and you’re trying to solve a crime that you know people from the immigrant community have information about, they may not talk to you if they think you’re also going to be enforcing the immigration laws. Local law enforcement has a different job than federal immigration enforcement. The problem is the federal government has totally abdicated its responsibility.”During an interview with Bill O’Reilly in 2008, highlighted this week by MRCTV, Clinton was equally on board with the idea of sanctuary policies:O’Reilly: Are you going to crack down on the sanctuary cities?Clinton: No, I’m not. And I’ll tell you why.O’Reilly: Whoa.Clinton: I’m not, I’m not because the reason why a lot of those folks do it — in New York, why do police officers turn a blind eye?O’Reilly: Because they want them to report crimes.Clinton: They want them to report crimes. Because…O’Reilly: Doesn’t override.Clinton: …the — well, sometimes you have two competing values. You want to report crime, you want to protect people and the violence spills way beyond whatever community…In the wake of the murder of Kate Steinle at the hands of a multiple-deportee, multiple felon — Clinton is now saying cities should cooperate with federal officials:CNN’s Brianna Keilar: “Last week, an undocumented immigrant who had been deported five times, killed a 32-year old woman, Kate Steinle, in San Francisco, a sanctuary city where local law enforcement does not enforce federal immigration laws. When you last ran for President you supported sanctuary cities. In light of this terrible incident, does that change anything about your view on this?”Clinton: “Well what should be done is any city should listen to the Department of Homeland Security, which as I understand it, urged them to deport this man again after he got out of prison another time. Here’s a case where we’ve deported, we’ve deported, we’ve deported, he ends back up in our country and I think the city made a mistake. The city made a mistake not to deport someone that the federal government strongly felt should be deported. So I have absolutely no support for a city that ignores the strong evidence that should be acted on. However, there are, like if it were the first-time traffic citation, if it were something minor, a misdemeanor, that’s entirely different. This man had already been deported five times, and he should have been deported at the request of the federal government.”Read More Stories About:Comment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Gerry Connolly on government workers under political fireBy Ed O'KeefeMore and more, when politicians talk about government employees -- whether they are federal, state or local -- it is with the kind of umbrage ordinarily aimed at Wall Street financiers and convenience store bandits.Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.)The Federal Eye and colleague Karen Tumulty write in Tuesday's Washington Post about the growing backlash against public sector employees -- an issue of special interest in the Washington area, which is home to about 600,000 federal workers.Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) represents about 56,000 of them who live in Northern Virginia. The Federal Eye spoke with him last week about the growing public sector backlash. A transcript -- edited for space -- appears below:Question: What do you make of this increased rhetoric against public sector workers, specifically, federal employees?""I think it's very easy for politicians to demonize federal employees. Politically, it costs very little to do that. But I think in terms of what it does in the cost to public service is considerable. Ultimately, the loser is the public itself, because the more you make public service unattractive, the more you reinforce stereotypes.""These aren't just nameless, faceless people who work in the bowels of a bureaucracy, they are real people who provide real services for real people. It just demeans public service in a way that ultimately costs the public.""Does this feel like something new or more intense than he has seen before? Is it new?""I think we've been doing this since the age of Ronald Reagan, maybe even Jimmy Carter. I'm a child of the 1960s, I remember John Kennedy and he ennobled public service. Starting around Jimmy Carter and certainly perfected by Ronald Reagan, we had a very different message about public service. I think we've been fighting that battle back and forth ever since.""What about President Obama: Is he closer to Reagan or Kennedy when it comes to public service and federal workers?""I think he's in between. Personally, he certainly believes in the nobility of service and would believe it's a calling that's worthy. But on the other hand, as a politician, I think he too quickly singled out federal employment as, 'That's the one I'm going to pluck out and put on the scoreboard. That's where we're going to save money.'""My reaction was, I believe federal employees and certainly the unions who represent them are willing to make a sacrifice and put some commitments on the table as part of this national cause of reducing red ink. But help me understand why of all the items on the menu being served up by the Deficit Reduction Committee, the White House in advance picks this one and says this is what we're going to do. And this one just happens to be aimed and about federal employment.Then what should he have picked otherwise?""I think the president unwittingly contributed to this unfriendly, if not hostile climate with respect to federal employment, and I think that's too bad. That's not the same as saying that they shouldn't be willing to make a sacrifice, but signaling it out in advance of the commission's report I think calls out the value we put on that service. To me, that's an unfortunate message that just piles on.""So where is this anti-public sector debate headed?""I think the Congress we elected in November is a lot less hospitable to the interests of federal employees. I think you're going to see a lot more legislative action and suggestion aimed at reducing the size and compensation of that federal workforce and retirees.""Going right at the benefits, going right at the size of the workforce, and frankly, being a lot less attuned to the quality of that workforce. Facts be damned: There's a lot of rhetoric on the other side about the growth of the federal workforce, but it's about the size it was under the first President Bush. There hasn't really been a lot of net growth in the federal workforce when you compare it to say, 1990. It's not like it's gotten out of hand, it's true. I'm afraid that in the focus of reinforcing a stereotype is what will be lost in discussions are the ones we ought to be having, which are the quality of the workforce.""Where are we going to get the sophisticated skillsets we need for the future if we're demeaning that service in the first place? I think it's self-defeating. It's a compelling issue, because an awful lot of people are qualified to retire.""What if anything are you going to do combat this?""If the other side of the aisle is willing to engage in meaningful reforms, where we can have win-win, and we're able to get more out of the federal workforce, I'm all for that. The president just signed my bill on telework last week. There are a lot of other initiatives that can upgrade how we do things in the federal workplace and how we recruit and retain skilled workers.What is really driving this debate?""What's the political cost back in Utah or Idaho or Wyoming? What's the cost of picking on the federal bureaucrat? It kind of feeds the narrative of this big, out or control federal bureaucracy that is so far removed from where you live and work that it's an unnecessary impediment to the rest of us getting on with our lives.""It's a powerful narrative in the sense I suppose of the American story, this fierce independence of Americans who, by nature are a little mistrustful of government. That's healthy. But to despise the public servant and demonize that public servant, with impunity, does a real disservice to public service and is dangerous in terms of the quality of the government we're going to need as we move forward.""""The next Congress almost guarantees that they'll be a lot more attackers than defenders. People like me are going to have a much harder job to make the case, because I think there are fewer willing ears.""Read the full story and leave your thoughts in the comments section below2010"	1.0

Because the fear part, of course, officers are trained to deal with that,” Wilkison says. “Texas has lost the most law enforcement officers in the line of duty in each state in America, and so that’s absolutely something they aware of coming into the job.”Texas will be sending 150 officers to assist with security at the upcoming Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio. Wilkinson says that he’s concerned for the safety of those officers, given the climate surrounding Donald Trump’s campaign.“I’m fearful that something will happen to them, especially with some of the political circumstances surrounding Donald Trump’s candidacy,” Wilkison says. “It seems to be very heated, and in very heated moments where people are clashing, and physical confrontations that we’ve all seen, I’m worried about those officers.”Listen to the full interview in the audio player above.Post by Alexandra Hart.Cancel replyNO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE, YOU’RE ON TEXAS STANDARD TIME©2014 Texas Standard.

She and her parents stepped off the MARTA bus stop nearby and walked toward the guards booth, where they were met with the blunt response.You cant come in here, she remembers the guard on duty telling them.As one of Georgias high school valedictorians, Abrams had been invited to meet the governor, along with other students across the state. The other valedictorians and their parents gained entrance without delay.AdvertisementAdvertisementJust think about being 17 years old, standing at these gates, one of the most important days of your life, and youre told you dont belong here, she tells The Root. That brands you. That stays with you.Her father, Robert, was able to convince the guard that they had been invited to the event, and the family eventually got in, but neither Abrams nor her parents remember being inside. They just recall being told they werent welcome. The experience expanded Abrams appreciation of how power, or proximity to it, could harm or exclude people.I did not know until much later that this was a memory that really propelled her to make sure that things were equal, that there is a level playing field for everybody else, Abrams mother, Carolyn, said in a phone interview.AdvertisementAbrams, 44, tells that story wherever she goes. It won over audiences at each event at which I saw her speak in December when I trailed along on her campaign stops. Its the story that fuels her resolve to become Georgias top politician. Last summer, Abrams gave up her seat and position as minority leader in the Georgia Statehouse to run for governorand if she wins, she would become the first black female governor in U.S. history.Shes betting on the progressive people of Georgia who have been ignored: immigrants and the working poor of all races. Her critics say the votes shes pursuing are simply not therethat conservative Georgia will never elect a progressive candidate, let alone a black woman, as governor. Her Democratic primary rival, Stacey Evans, a former Georgia legislator, is also formidable and is sure to give Abrams a run for her money all the way up to the primary election in May. AdvertisementFor those who suspect that Georgia wont go blue, consider this: By 2025, Georgia is expected to become a minority-majority state; U.S. census data has Georgias current white population at 61 percent (recent data says that white registered voters dropped from 59 percent of Georgias electorate to under 57 percent in 2016), while black population stands at 32 percent, Latino at 9.4 percent and Asian at 4.1 percent. Abrams believes that theres a growing, multiracial coalition of Georgians who are ready to elect her.AdvertisementThe goal that I have is to ensure that we build a coalition that reflects that opportunity, she says. Because we are so close to [racial] parity, and no other state is positioned where we are in terms of the composition of that parity. We have the voters ... to build a brand-new coalition we havent really seen in a Southern state.AdvertisementAbrams run is really a defining moment for the Democratic Party as a whole. Given that black women pretty much elected Alabama Democrat Doug Jones to the U.S. Senate, some national observers believe the party owes them Abrams. The Democrats have long been the more progressive of the two dominant parties, but that means they have come to rely on the black vote while still mostly running white candidates. Now is the hour of reckoning for the Democrats to step up and live up to their supposed ideals of being for the working class and minorities.They have an opportunity to support a candidate who embodies what the future of the party should be, says L. Joy Williams, chairwoman of Higher Heights. The question is whether or not the party, and not just the DNC [Democratic National Committee], the Democratic Governors Association, all of the fundraising apparatuses, will have the wherewithal and the guts to stand up and work their hardest to ensure we have a victory in Georgia.AdvertisementOr, put it this way: Black people have always believed in white Democrats and vigorously voted for them. No matter how imperfect. In Georgia, will white Democrats, statewide and nationally, believe in Stacey Abrams?Two weeks before Jones upset Roy Moore in Alabama, I speak with Abrams in her small office at her campaign headquarters in Atlanta. Tax-law books are stacked on shelves by her desk. Before winning her seat in the Georgia Legislature in 2006, Abrams was the deputy attorney for the city, a position she held 2003-2006. Wearing her signature twist-outs and brimming with a confident calm, she tells me why shes primed to win the governors race this year.AdvertisementAdvertisementShe points out that in the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton lost the state to Donald Trump by 5 percentage points, a 3-point improvement on Barack Obamas showing in 2012. Obama and Clinton could have won Georgia, Abrams believes, had they devoted more resources to her state.Those are all communities ripe for engagement if we respect them enough to do the same work for them that were willing to do for the other side, she says. One of the reasons Im running is that I have a long history of unapologetically progressive values. I have stood in my truth and done the work, and I know that it is time to bring that to a broader swath of Georgians.I watch Abrams tell a conference table of 12 leaders of the Muslim community in Clarkston, Ga., as much one Saturday afternoon. Sitting at the head of the table, she fields questions about how she would take on Islamophobia if elected governor of Georgia in November. One man mentions the anti-Islam rally held on the steps of the state Capitol in Atlanta last year.Stacey Abrams speaking to constituents at a roundtable discussion in Clarkston, Ga. (Terrell Jermaine Starr/The Root)If youre the governor, how would you respond to that? he asks.Abrams, without hesitation, says she would condemn the rally and tell any Muslim working that day that they could go home.You dont have to subject yourself to that kind of abuse, she adds.Heads nod approvingly.Another attendee tells Abrams that there is a lot of rhetoric dividing the country. What will you do to unite Georgia? she asks.AdvertisementAdvertisementWeve allowed divisive nationalism make us forget who we are as Americans, Abrams responds. And our responsibility is to be, not just a haven, but an incubator for good ideas and opportunity. Having communities that are able to integrate, not assimilate, but to integrate into the broader community is a healthy thing for a community.One of Abrams aides politely rises and cautions it is time for the candidate to sit for her interview with a local radio station across the hall in the same building. The host thanks Abrams and insists that she return. Abrams says she will.Clarkston is just 30 minutes outside Atlanta and takes in 1,500 refugees a year and has welcomed as many as 25,000especially those from Africa and Southeast Asiaover the past 25 years. Many of these residents are now citizens who can vote. As Abrams explains, there are enough Clarkstons to pull her through. She has more than 200 volunteers knocking on doors and making phone calls throughout the state to reach them.AdvertisementShe raised half-a-million dollars for the race by June of 2016 (her campaign will release campaign filings for the remainder of the year in March) and has picked up some major endorsements, including those of Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) and former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner of Bernie Sanders Our Revolution. Nationally, she has rock-star appeal. At each of the campaign events I visited, lines formed, with folks wanting to frame themselves in history before a history-making event potentially happens: a black women in the governors mansion.Stacey Abrams with Rep. John Lewis in an undated photo (courtesy of Stacey Abrams for Governor) The DNC indicates that it understands the symbolism of Abrams run. Though the DNC doesnt engage during primaries, the bodys Black Caucus Chair Virgie M. Rollins said in an email to The Root that it invested nearly $1 million in the Alabama general election to mobilize that states black voters.AdvertisementAdvertisementOur victories in Virginia, New Jersey and our historic win in Alabama with the election of Doug Jones, which wouldnt have been possible if we had not invested in the Alabamas African-American community, Rollins added.Abrams knows that there are doubters who feel her candidacy is nothing more than wishful thinking.White folks in Georgia would never vote for a black person for governor. Especially a black woman.People are too stuck in their ways. Its just not her time yet.State Rep. Al Williams (D-Midway), one of Abrams early supporters, pushes back against such assertions, saying that one advantage Abrams has is that she is running statewide and not out of a district, where shed have to contend with gerrymandered voting areas that make it hard for black people to compete.AdvertisementAdvertisementTheres not a better time to have a Stacey Abrams running for governor than now, he says. Republicans are singing the same old song, most times playing to peoples fears. Georgia is in change mode. A whole lot of people who moved here since the last governors race are not hard-core red or blue. Theyre looking for true leadership.A Yale-trained lawyer, Abrams says that she registered 200,000 people to vote in Georgia in 2008 through her organization, New Georgia Project. She was the minority leader of the state Assembly 2011-2017. She doesnt run away from being a black woman. She embraces it, in fact. But she doesnt want it to be the only marker that defines her, either.Im not running because Im a person of color, Im not running because Im a woman. But because of both of those parts of who I am, I have to navigate challenges that a lot of other folks havent had to deal with, she tells me. I have to answer questions that others arent asked.On the evening of Dec. 2, I go to Gainesville, Ga., just 35 minutes outside of Atlanta, to see Abrams speak at a meeting organized by the Hall County Democratic Party. She tells that story about being denied entry to the governors mansion to a racially diverse crowd of people, young and old. Some cover their mouths in shock. Some of the older black women sitting in the back shake their heads.AdvertisementAdvertisementOne of them writes a check to Abrams campaign soon after she finishes her remarks.In the same speech, Abrams talked about having been born in Wisconsin and growing up in Gulfport, Miss., before moving to Decatur, Ga., with her family. She was a star student, and most of her five siblings did well for themselves, too. One, Leslie, is a federal judge; her older sister Andrea is a tenured professor. Janine, her younger sister, is an evolutionary biologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Her brother Richard is a behavioral health counselor who works with foster kids down in southwest Atlanta.Top row: Stacey Abrams; brother Walter; sister Andrea and sister Leslie. Bottom row: Abrams father, Richard; sister Jeanine; brother Richard; and mother, Carolyn. (Courtesy of Stacey Abrams for Governor) Then there is Walter, who dropped out of Morehouse College and is currently serving prison time in Mississippi. He has mental health issues and feels his recidivism issues stem from his lack of access to mental health care, a reason Abrams is so passionate about expanding Medicaid.AdvertisementWalter is one of the reasons Im so committed to expanding Medicaid because it provides mental health insurance, she says. It is a critical piece of what happened to him.AdvertisementThat was what won over Jennifer LaRose, a white woman who brought her two children to hear Abrams speak. LaRose voted Republican until Barack Obamas second term. One of her sons has health issues and relies on Medicaid to help cover costs. LaRose likes that Abrams wants to expand Medicaid (Georgias current governor, Nathan Deal, elected not to expand it). Abrams view is something LaRose believes will help the candidate win over lots of people like her.Its going to win over a lot of people on both sides of the aisle, she says.Abrams desire to expand Medicaid also struck a chord with Deborah Mack, a black woman who once served as Hall County commissioner. She says that Abrams story should resonate with enough voters in Georgia to win, but black people need to do their part to make it happen.AdvertisementI think a black woman can win in the state of Georgia, but we have to not be so complacent and take it for granted its going to happen, she says. We have to work, too. We have to get out there and vote.As a minority leader, Abrams earned a reputation for being unafraid of taking on GOP leadership and working with them when her hands were tied. The GOP had the state House of Representatives, the Senate and the governorship, making Abrams ability to pass progressive legislation nearly impossible. So she had to negotiate with Republicans, often making a bad bill not so bad.AdvertisementOne of them was 2016s House Bill 941, a bipartisan bill that curtails grand jury privileges for officers who shoot and kill on duty. Prior to this bill, police officers were permitted to be present during the entire grand jury proceedings, make a statement at the end, and be exempt from being questioned. Georgia was the only state that allowed this privilege, Abrams campaign says. AdvertisementAbrams worked with Republicans and law enforcement to make sure cops had to be questioned. However, some lawmakers in her own party felt that she sided with Republicans too much, a charge Carolyn Hugley, who served as minority whip while Abrams was leader, says is unfair.When youre the leader of the minority party, you first have to think about Lets do no harm or the least harm to the citizens we care about, Hugley says. When you are in that leadership position, sometimes youre going to take the position others feel is not a pure position. Minimize the harm to be done when you dont have the power to make the final decision.LeDawn Jones, a former state representative and a supporter of Abrams primary opponent Stacey Evans, said during a phone interview that she respects both Abrams and Evans and believes that Democrats are in a great position for the general election regardless of who wins the primary. However, while Jones described Abrams as a genius, she that said Abrams was not a real progressive. She didnt do nearly enough to challenge Republicans in power and could have done more to challenge the GOPs authority, Jones added.AdvertisementSo many areas that I think we could have made a bigger impact to let people know that we were fighting for them, Jones said. She had a very difficult job and no one expected it to be done to perfection. But when you ask if shes a progressive leader in todays progressive movement, I think a true progressive leader would have used that position as minority leader to bring light to a lot more progressive social justice issues.AdvertisementIn an email, Abrams campaign spokesperson Caitlin Highland rejected those claims, saying that Abrams has called for the removal of Confederate monuments as a gubernatorial candidate and led protests against the Confederate flag. As a member of the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus and as minority leader, Abrams deferred to the leadership of the GLBC, which was debating efforts to remove Confederate monuments, Highland wrote.Stacey Evans campaign said that the candidate was not available for an interview, but her spokesperson, Seth Clark, wrote in an email to The Root that Evans and Abrams worked alongside each other well, even through their disagreements. Evans strongest criticism of Abrams comes in how the former minority leader brokered the states HOPE scholarship program (Georgias tuition-free Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally program) with Republicans. Clark charged that it was one of the worst pieces of legislation in years.AdvertisementBecause of the [Georgia Gov. Nathan] Deal-Abrams bill, roughly a quarter of the technical college student body dropped out, Clark wrote.In response, Highland said that Abrams hands were tied.In 2011, Gov. Deal proposed legislation to overhaul Georgias HOPE scholarship, a merit-based scholarship program funded by lottery sales that was rapidly approaching insolvency after the Great Recession, Highland said in an email. The original HOPE bill funded universal pre-K for 4 year olds, higher education funding and technology. Under Abrams leadership, Democrats fought to prevent certain cuts and make sure the bill included funding for remedial classes at technical colleges, a 1 percent low interest loan program, and prevented the use of ACT/SAT testing standards that would have harmed poor students and students of color. In addition, [Abrams] prevented Republicans from cutting a full day of pre-K for 4 year olds to a half daya key achievement of the compromise.In 1992, an uprising erupted outside the gates of Spelman College after the Los Angeles police officers who were captured on video mercilessly beating Rodney King were found not guilty. Abrams was a sophomore at the all-womens HBCU at the time. She remembers coughing from the tear gas that cops fired into the crowds and that made its way on to campus. News articles from that day report 22 people and 17 officers were hospitalized; 70 were arrested in connection with the riots. State police dressed in riot gear surrounded the state Capitol. National Guard helicopters flew over the business district to protect property.AdvertisementAdvertisementA student at nearby Atlanta University (now known as Clark-Atlanta University) at the time told the Los Angeles Times that officers came on campus to disperse students protesting the verdict. It was a peaceful protest, said Andrea Henderson, an Atlanta University student and resident of a freshman dormitory. The police came on campus and tried to disperse us. I dont think they had the right to do that.Abrams at Spelman College in an undated photo (courtesy of Stacey Abrams for Governor) Abrams felt that then-Mayor Maynard Jacksons response was too aggressive. Even more troubling to her were the ways in which local media depicted black people.AdvertisementI was angry, Abrams says. I started a phone tree in my dorm and started calling all of the reporters at ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox News, telling them they were wrong about what was happening and were mischaracterizing what was going on, and that they needed to stop.Abrams and some of her classmates were invited to a public forum, where they aired their issues with the citys response to Jackson. He pointedly told her that she didnt know what she was talking about, as she remembers the exchange, but the experience taught her to speak truth to power. It also endeared her to Jackson. Abrams and a classmate were offered internships with the citys Office of Youth Services. It was her first real taste of public service.AdvertisementIll never forget. They came into the office and said, We dont want to be interns. We want to be research assistants, Melanie Campbell, who oversaw the department, remembers Abrams telling her. They did good research, though.AdvertisementI tell Abrams that she, too, may deal with civil unrest as governor. One day, she may have to consider deploying law enforcement to handle the kinds of uprisings that have taken place in Baltimore, New York City and Ferguson, Mo. The kind that rocked Los Angeles and Atlanta and other cities around the nation while she was a student. I ask her if she had seen any examples of public officials handing the aforementioned uprisings inappropriately.If you look at some of the reaction, there is an aggression that takes place sometimes that far outweighs the potential harm that could be done, Abrams says. We have seen time and again that there is a difference in response depending on the racial complexion of the protest. And that is problematic. I do not ever question the responsibility of our law enforcement to protect citizens. But I do question and always will ask, and demand as governor, that that reaction be responsive to not our fears of what will happen but the reality of whats on the ground.It is a carefully tailored response. If she does become governor and faces the unfortunate circumstance of civil uprising in response to police brutality, it will be interesting to see how the activism that pushed her to challenge a sitting mayor while a Spelman student will influence her response to police abuse as a governor.Abrams meets around 40 volunteers at a MARTA station in Northeast Atlanta to canvas neighborhoods in nearly Decatur on a cool-by-Atlanta-standards Saturday morning in December. Some of them strategically stake Abrams for Governor campaign signs wherever the dirt gives. It is a diverse crowd, but black women are prominent. Abrams is running a multicultural campaign based on a very multicultural message, but if she is to win, it will very likely be because of black women, as was the case for Doug Jones in Alabama.AdvertisementAdvertisementAngela Crawford, one of the volunteers, tells me her parents are 93 years old and never imagined their votes would elect the first black president. Neither is able to go out and physically vote, so they cast absentee ballots. Crawford says that shell help her parents make history twice for Abrams in Mays Democratic primary.They saw it could happen with [Obama], so they believe it can happen for the next person, she says. Im going to make sure that next year, when we get ready to vote, that they will cast their ballots.In 2008, Obama was running on hope and change. In 2018, Abrams is running against hate, despair and an oligarchy that has turned the White House into a kleptocracy. Donald Trump is all the way up in Washington, D.C., but his policies are pushing Abrams to warn her supporters of what could happen if a Republican wins the governors race: Trump 2.0.AdvertisementIn 2016, Georgia came within 200,000 votes of making sure the orange occupant did not take the White House, she tells her supporters at the MARTA stop that morning. For too long, we havent done the work of touching every single person. We talk to people we know about the things we like and we hope theyll figure it out. But we know the way to create change is to reach out beyond ourselves.Then, she returns to the story of how she was denied entry to the governors mansion, a rallying cry for the dozens of supporters surrounding her.AdvertisementAll I remember was a man at a gate, telling me that I dont belong. Telling me this wasnt my state. That I possibly couldnt deserve to be inside, she says. I think about that when Im standing here because MARTA got me from Decatur to the governors mansion before, and today, I think its going to do it again.AdvertisementFrom there, her small group of canvassers splits up into groups, maps out which parts of Decatur theyll target and get to knocking on doors of residents they hope will get Abrams into the governors mansion. This time, the guard will know her name.	1.0

I put some highlights below. There is a lot of policy positions that we should give an extra scrub with Policy. In terms of what was opened to the press and what was not, the Washington Examiner got a hold of one of the private speech contracts (her speeches to universities were typically open press), so this is worth a read http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/clintons-speeches-are-cozy-for-wall-streeters-but-closed-to-journalists/article/2553294/section/author/dan-friedman *CLINTON ADMITS SHE IS OUT OF TOUCH* *Hillary Clinton: “I'm Kind Of Far Removed” From The Struggles Of The Middle Class “Because The Life I've Lived And The Economic, You Know, Fortunes That My Husband And I Now Enjoy.” *“And I am not taking a position on any policy, but I do think there is a growing sense of anxiety and even anger in the country over the feeling that the game is rigged. And I never had that feeling when I was growing up. Never. I mean, were there really rich people, of course there were. My father loved to complain about big business and big government, but we had a solid middle class upbringing. We had good public schools. We had accessible health care. We had our little, you know, one-family house that, you know, he saved up his money, didn't believe in mortgages. So I lived that. And now, obviously, I'm kind of far removed because the life I've lived and the economic, you know, fortunes that my husband and I now enjoy, but I haven't forgotten it.” [Hillary Clinton Remarks at Goldman-Black Rock, 2/4/14] *CLINTON SAYS YOU NEED TO HAVE A PRIVATE AND PUBLIC POSITION ON POLICY* *Clinton: “But If Everybody's Watching, You Know, All Of The Back Room Discussions And The Deals, You Know, Then People Get A Little Nervous, To Say The Least. So, You Need Both A Public And A Private Position.”* CLINTON: You just have to sort of figure out how to -- getting back to that word, ""balance"" -- how to balance the public and the private efforts that are necessary to be successful, politically, and that's not just a comment about today. That, I think, has probably been true for all of our history, and if you saw the Spielberg movie, Lincoln, and how he was maneuvering and working to get the 13th Amendment passed, and he called one of my favorite predecessors, Secretary Seward, who had been the governor and senator from New York, ran against Lincoln for president, and he told Seward, I need your help to get this done. And Seward called some of his lobbyist friends who knew how to make a deal, and they just kept going at it. I mean, politics is like sausage being made. It is unsavory, and it always has been that way, but we usually end up where we need to be. But if everybody's watching, you know, all of the back room discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous, to say the least. So, you need both a public and a private position. And finally, I think -- I believe in evidence-based decision making. I want to know what the facts are. I mean, it's like when you guys go into some kind of a deal, you know, are you going to do that development or not, are you going to do that renovation or not, you know, you look at the numbers. You try to figure out what's going to work and what's not going to work. [Clinton Speech For National Multi-Housing Council, 4/24/13] *CLINTON TALKS ABOUT HOLDING WALL STREET ACCOUNTABLE ONLY FOR POLITICAL REASONS* *Clinton Said That The Blame Placed On The United States Banking System For The Crisis “Could Have Been Avoided In Terms Of Both Misunderstanding And Really Politicizing What Happened.”* “That was one of the reasons that I started traveling in February of '09, so people could, you know, literally yell at me for the United States and our banking system causing this everywhere. Now, that's an oversimplification we know, but it was the conventional wisdom. And I think that there's a lot that could have been avoided in terms of both misunderstanding and really politicizing what happened with greater transparency, with greater openness on all sides, you know, what happened, how did it happen, how do we prevent it from happening? You guys help us figure it out and let's make sure that we do it right this time. And I think that everybody was desperately trying to fend off the worst effects institutionally, governmentally, and there just wasn't that opportunity to try to sort this out, and that came later.” [Goldman Sachs AIMS Alternative Investments Symposium, 10/24/13] *Clinton: “Even If It May Not Be 100 Percent True, If The Perception Is That Somehow The Game Is Rigged, That Should Be A Problem For All Of Us.” *“Now, it's important to recognize the vital role that the financial markets play in our economy and that so many of you are contributing to. To function effectively those markets and the men and women who shape them have to command trust and confidence, because we all rely on the market's transparency and integrity. So even if it may not be 100 percent true, if the perception is that somehow the game is rigged, that should be a problem for all of us, and we have to be willing to make that absolutely clear. And if there are issues, if there's wrongdoing, people have to be held accountable and we have to try to deter future bad behavior, because the public trust is at the core of both a free market economy and a democracy.” [Clinton Remarks to Deutsche Bank, 10/7/14] *CLINTON SUGGESTS WALL STREET INSIDERS ARE WHAT IS NEEDED TO FIX WALL STREET* *Clinton Said Financial Reform “Really Has To Come From The Industry Itself.” *“Remember what Teddy Roosevelt did. Yes, he took on what he saw as the excesses in the economy, but he also stood against the excesses in politics. He didn't want to unleash a lot of nationalist, populistic reaction. He wanted to try to figure out how to get back into that balance that has served America so well over our entire nationhood. Today, there's more that can and should be done that really has to come from the industry itself, and how we can strengthen our economy, create more jobs at a time where that's increasingly challenging, to get back to Teddy Roosevelt's square deal. And I really believe that our country and all of you are up to that job.” [Clinton Remarks to Deutsche Bank, 10/7/14] *Speaking About The Importance Of Proper Regulation, Clinton Said “The People That Know The Industry Better Than Anybody Are The People Who Work In The Industry.”* “I mean, it's still happening, as you know. People are looking back and trying to, you know, get compensation for bad mortgages and all the rest of it in some of the agreements that are being reached. There's nothing magic about regulations, too much is bad, too little is bad. How do you get to the golden key, how do we figure out what works? And the people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry. And I think there has to be a recognition that, you know, there's so much at stake now, I mean, the business has changed so much and decisions are made so quickly, in nano seconds basically. We spend trillions of dollars to travel around the world, but it's in everybody's interest that we have a better framework, and not just for the United States but for the entire world, in which to operate and trade.” [Goldman Sachs AIMS Alternative Investments Symposium, 10/24/13] *CLINTON ADMITS NEEDING WALL STREET FUNDING* *Clinton Said That Because Candidates Needed Money From Wall Street To Run For Office, People In New York Needed To Ask Tough Questions About The Economy Before Handing Over Campaign Contributions. *“Secondly, running for office in our country takes a lot of money, and candidates have to go out and raise it. New York is probably the leading site for contributions for fundraising for candidates on both sides of the aisle, and it's also our economic center. And there are a lot of people here who should ask some tough questions before handing over campaign contributions to people who were really playing chicken with our whole economy.” [Goldman Sachs AIMS Alternative Investments Symposium, 10/24/13] *Clinton: “It Would Be Very Difficult To Run For President Without Raising A Huge Amount Of Money And Without Having Other People Supporting You Because Your Opponent Will Have Their Supporters.”* “So our system is, in many ways, more difficult, certainly far more expensive and much longer than a parliamentary system, and I really admire the people who subject themselves to it. Even when I, you know, think they should not be elected president, I still think, well, you know, good for you I guess, you're out there promoting democracy and those crazy ideas of yours. So I think that it's something -- I would like -- you know, obviously as somebody who has been through it, I would like it not to last as long because I think it's very distracting from what we should be doing every day in our public business. I would like it not to be so expensive. I have no idea how you do that. I mean, in my campaign -- I lose track, but I think I raised $250 million or some such enormous amount, and in the last campaign President Obama raised 1.1 billion, and that was before the Super PACs and all of this other money just rushing in, and it's so ridiculous that we have this kind of free for all with all of this financial interest at stake, but, you know, the Supreme Court said that's basically what we're in for. So we're kind of in the wild west, and, you know, it would be very difficult to run for president without raising a huge amount of money and without having other people supporting you because your opponent will have their supporters. So I think as hard as it was when I ran, I think it's even harder now.” [Clinton Speech For General Electric’s Global Leadership Meeting – Boca Raton, FL, 1/6/14] *CLINTON TOUTS HER RELATIONSHIP TO WALL STREET AS A SENATOR* *Clinton: As Senator, “I Represented And Worked With” So Many On Wall Street And “Did All I Could To Make Sure They Continued To Prosper” But Still Called For Closing Carried Interest Loophole. *In remarks at Robbins, Gellar, Rudman & Dowd in San Diego, Hillary Clinton said, “When I was a Senator from New York, I represented and worked with so many talented principled people who made their living in finance. But even thought I represented them and did all I could to make sure they continued to prosper, I called for closing the carried interest loophole and addressing skyrocketing CEO pay. I also was calling in '06, '07 for doing something about the mortgage crisis, because I saw every day from Wall Street literally to main streets across New York how a well-functioning financial system is essential. So when I raised early warnings about early warnings about subprime mortgages and called for regulating derivatives and over complex financial products, I didn't get some big arguments, because people sort of said, no, that makes sense. But boy, have we had fights about it ever since.” [Hillary Clinton’s Remarks at Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd in San Diego, 9/04/14] *Clinton On Wall Street: “I Had Great Relations And Worked So Close Together After 9/11 To Rebuild Downtown, And A Lot Of Respect For The Work You Do And The People Who Do It.” *“Now, without going over how we got to where we are right now, what would be your advice to the Wall Street community and the big banks as to the way forward with those two important decisions? SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, I represented all of you for eight years. I had great relations and worked so close together after 9/11 to rebuild downtown, and a lot of respect for the work you do and the people who do it, but I do -- I think that when we talk about the regulators and the politicians, the economic consequences of bad decisions back in '08, you know, were devastating, and they had repercussions throughout the world.” [Goldman Sachs AIMS Alternative Investments Symposium, 10/24/13] *CLINTON TALKS ABOUT THE CHALLENGES RUNNING FOR OFFICE* *Hillary Clinton Said There Was “A Bias Against People Who Have Led Successful And/Or Complicated Lives,” Citing The Need To Divese Of Assets, Positions, And Stocks.* “SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah. Well, you know what Bob Rubin said about that. He said, you know, when he came to Washington, he had a fortune. And when he left Washington, he had a small -- MR. BLANKFEIN: That’s how you have a small fortune, is you go to Washington. SECRETARY CLINTON: You go to Washington. Right. But, you know, part of the problem with the political situation, too, is that there is such a bias against people who have led successful and/or complicated lives. You know, the divestment of assets, the stripping of all kinds of positions, the sale of stocks. It just becomes very onerous and unnecessary.” [Goldman Sachs Builders And Innovators Summit, 10/29/13] *CLINTON SUGGESTS SHE IS A MODERATE* *Clinton Said That Both The Democratic And Republican Parties Should Be “Moderate.” *“URSULA BURNS: Interesting. Democrats? SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, long, definitely. URSULA BURNS: Republicans? SECRETARY CLINTON: Unfortunately, at the time, short. URSULA BURNS: Okay. We'll go back to questions. SECRETARY CLINTON: We need two parties. URSULA BURNS: Yeah, we do need two parties. SECRETARY CLINTON: Two sensible, moderate, pragmatic parties.” [Hillary Clinton Remarks, Remarks at Xerox, 3/18/14] *Clinton: “Simpson-Bowles… Put Forth The Right Framework. Namely, We Have To Restrain Spending, We Have To Have Adequate Revenues, And We Have To Incentivize Growth. It's A Three-Part Formula… And They Reached An Agreement. But What Is Very Hard To Do Is To Then Take That Agreement If You Don't Believe That You're Going To Be Able To Move The Other Side.”* SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, this may be borne more out of hope than experience in the last few years. But Simpson-Bowles -- and I know you heard from Erskine earlier today -- put forth the right framework. Namely, we have to restrain spending, we have to have adequate revenues, and we have to incentivize growth. It's a three-part formula. The specifics can be negotiated depending upon whether we're acting in good faith or not. And what Senator Simpson and Erskine did was to bring Republicans and Democrats alike to the table, and you had the full range of ideological views from I think Tom Coburn to Dick Durbin. And they reached an agreement. But what is very hard to do is to then take that agreement if you don't believe that you're going to be able to move the other side. And where we are now is in this gridlocked dysfunction. So you've got Democrats saying that, you know, you have to have more revenues; that's the sine qua non of any kind of agreement. You have Republicans saying no, no, no on revenues; you have to cut much more deeply into spending. Well, looks what's happened. We are slowly returning to growth. It's not as much or as fast as many of us would like to see, but, you know, we're certainly better off than our European friends, and we're beginning to, I believe, kind of come out of the long aftermath of the '08 crisis. [Clinton Speech For Morgan Stanley, 4/18/13] *Clinton: “The Simpson-Bowles Framework And The Big Elements Of It Were Right… You Have To Restrain Spending, You Have To Have Adequate Revenues, And You Have To Have Growth.”* CLINTON: So, you know, the Simpson-Bowles framework and the big elements of it were right. The specifics can be negotiated and argued over. But you got to do all three. You have to restrain spending, you have to have adequate revenues, and you have to have growth. And I think we are smart enough to figure out how to do that. [Clinton Speech For Morgan Stanley, 4/18/13] *CLINTON IS AWARE OF SECURITY CONCERNS AROUND BLACKBERRIES* *Clinton: “At The State Department We Were Attacked Every Hour, More Than Once An Hour By Incoming Efforts To Penetrate Everything We Had. And That Was True Across The U.S. Government.”* CLINTON: But, at the State Department we were attacked every hour, more than once an hour by incoming efforts to penetrate everything we had. And that was true across the U.S. government. And we knew it was going on when I would go to China, or I would go to Russia, we would leave all of our electronic equipment on the plane, with the batteries out, because this is a new frontier. And they're trying to find out not just about what we do in our government. They're trying to find out about what a lot of companies do and they were going after the personal emails of people who worked in the State Department. So it's not like the only government in the world that is doing anything is the United States. But, the United States compared to a number of our competitors is the only government in the world with any kind of safeguards, any kind of checks and balances. They may in many respects need to be strengthened and people need to be reassured, and they need to have their protections embodied in law. But, I think turning over a lot of that material intentionally or unintentionally, because of the way it can be drained, gave all kinds of information not only to big countries, but to networks and terrorist groups, and the like. So I have a hard time thinking that somebody who is a champion of privacy and liberty has taken refuge in Russia under Putin's authority. And then he calls into a Putin talk show and says, President Putin, do you spy on people? And President Putin says, well, from one intelligence professional to another, of course not. Oh, thank you so much. I mean, really, I don't know. I have a hard time following it. [Clinton Speech At UConn, 4/23/14] *Hillary Clinton: “When I Got To The State Department, It Was Still Against The Rules To Let Most -- Or Let All Foreign Service Officers Have Access To A Blackberry.” *“I mean, let's face it, our government is woefully, woefully behind in all of its policies that affect the use of technology. When I got to the State Department, it was still against the rules to let most -- or let all Foreign Service Officers have access to a Blackberry. You couldn't have desktop computers when Colin Powell was there. Everything that you are taking advantage of, inventing and using, is still a generation or two behind when it comes to our government.” [Hillary Clinton Remarks at Nexenta, 8/28/14] *Hillary Clinton: “We Couldn't Take Our Computers, We Couldn't Take Our Personal Devices” Off The Plane In China And Russia. *“I mean, probably the most frustrating part of this whole debate are countries acting like we're the only people in the world trying to figure out what's going on. I mean, every time I went to countries like China or Russia, I mean, we couldn't take our computers, we couldn't take our personal devices, we couldn't take anything off the plane because they're so good, they would penetrate them in a minute, less, a nanosecond. So we would take the batteries out, we'd leave them on the plane.” [Hillary Clinton Remarks at Nexenta, 8/28/14] *Clinton Said When She Got To State, Employees “Were Not Mostly Permitted To Have Handheld Devices.”* “You know, when Colin Powell showed up as Secretary of State in 2001, most State Department employees still didn't even have computers on their desks. When I got there they were not mostly permitted to have handheld devices. I mean, so you're thinking how do we operate in this new environment dominated by technology, globalizing forces? We have to change, and I can't expect people to change if I don't try to model it and lead it.” [Clinton Speech For General Electric’s Global Leadership Meeting – Boca Raton, FL, 1/6/14] *Hillary Clinton Said You Know You Can’t Bring Your Phone And Computer When Traveling To China And Russia And She Had To Take Her Batteries Out And Put them In A Special Box. *“And anybody who has ever traveled in other countries, some of which shall remain nameless, except for Russia and China, you know that you can’t bring your phones and your computers. And if you do, good luck. I mean, we would not only take the batteries out, we would leave the batteries and the devices on the plane in special boxes. Now, we didn’t do that because we thought it would be fun to tell somebody about. We did it because we knew that we were all targets and that we would be totally vulnerable. So it’s not only what others do to us and what we do to them and how many people are involved in it. It’s what’s the purpose of it, what is being collected, and how can it be used. And there are clearly people in this room who know a lot about this, and some of you could be very useful contributors to that conversation because you’re sophisticated enough to know that it’s not just, do it, don’t do it. We have to have a way of doing it, and then we have to have a way of analyzing it, and then we have to have a way of sharing it.” [Goldman Sachs Builders And Innovators Summit, 10/29/13] *Hillary Clinton Lamented How Far Behind The State Department Was In Technology, Saying “People Were Not Even Allowed To Use Mobile Devices Because Of Security Issues.” *“Personally, having, you know, lived and worked in the White House, having been a senator, having been Secretary of State, there has traditionally been a great pool of very talented, hard-working people. And just as I was saying about the credit market, our personnel policies haven’t kept up with the changes necessary in government. We have a lot of difficulties in getting—when I got to the State Department, we were so far behind in technology, it was embarrassing. And, you know, people were not even allowed to use mobile devices because of security issues and cost issues, and we really had to try to push into the last part of the 20th Century in order to get people functioning in 2009 and ‘10.” [Goldman Sachs Builders And Innovators Summit, 10/29/13] *CLINTON REMARKS ARE PRO KEYSTONE AND PRO TRADE* *Clinton: “So I Think That Keystone Is A Contentious Issue, And Of Course It Is Important On Both Sides Of The Border For Different And Sometimes Opposing Reasons…” *“So I think that Keystone is a contentious issue, and of course it is important on both sides of the border for different and sometimes opposing reasons, but that is not our relationship. And I think our relationship will get deeper and stronger and put us in a position to really be global leaders in energy and climate change if we worked more closely together. And that's what I would like to see us do.” [Remarks at tinePublic, 6/18/14] *Hillary Clinton Said Her Dream Is A Hemispheric Common Market, With Open Trade And Open Markets. *“My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.” [05162013 Remarks to Banco Itau.doc, p. 28] *Hillary Clinton Said We Have To Have A Concerted Plan To Increase Trade; We Have To Resist Protectionism And Other Kinds Of Barriers To Trade. *“Secondly, I think we have to have a concerted plan to increase trade already under the current circumstances, you know, that Inter-American Development Bank figure is pretty surprising. There is so much more we can do, there is a lot of low hanging fruit but businesses on both sides have to make it a priority and it's not for governments to do but governments can either make it easy or make it hard and we have to resist, protectionism, other kinds of barriers to market access and to trade and I would like to see this get much more attention and be not just a policy for a year under president X or president Y but a consistent one.” [05162013 Remarks to Banco Itau.doc, p. 32] *CLINTON IS MORE FAVORABLE TO CANADIAN HEALTH CARE AND SINGLE PAYER* *Clinton Said Single-Payer Health Care Systems “Can Get Costs Down,” And “Is As Good Or Better On Primary Care,” But “They Do Impose Things Like Waiting Times.” *“If you look at countries that are comparable, like Switzerland or Germany, for example, they have mixed systems. They don't have just a single-payer system, but they have very clear controls over budgeting and accountability. If you look at the single-payer systems, like Scandinavia, Canada, and elsewhere, they can get costs down because, you know, although their care, according to statistics, overall is as good or better on primary care, in particular, they do impose things like waiting times, you know. It takes longer to get like a hip replacement than it might take here.” [Hillary Clinton remarks to ECGR Grand Rapids, 6/17/13] *Clinton Cited President Johnson’s Success In Establishing Medicare And Medicaid And Said She Wanted To See The U.S. Have Universal Health Care Like In Canada.* “You know, on healthcare we are the prisoner of our past. The way we got to develop any kind of medical insurance program was during World War II when companies facing shortages of workers began to offer healthcare benefits as an inducement for employment. So from the early 1940s healthcare was seen as a privilege connected to employment. And after the war when soldiers came back and went back into the market there was a lot of competition, because the economy was so heated up. So that model continued. And then of course our large labor unions bargained for healthcare with the employers that their members worked for. So from the early 1940s until the early 1960s we did not have any Medicare, or our program for the poor called Medicaid until President Johnson was able to get both passed in 1965. So the employer model continued as the primary means by which working people got health insurance. People over 65 were eligible for Medicare. Medicaid, which was a partnership, a funding partnership between the federal government and state governments, provided some, but by no means all poor people with access to healthcare. So what we've been struggling with certainly Harry Truman, then Johnson was successful on Medicare and Medicaid, but didn't touch the employer based system, then actually Richard Nixon made a proposal that didn't go anywhere, but was quite far reaching. Then with my husband's administration we worked very hard to come up with a system, but we were very much constricted by the political realities that if you had your insurance from your employer you were reluctant to try anything else. And so we were trying to build a universal system around the employer-based system. And indeed now with President Obama's legislative success in getting the Affordable Care Act passed that is what we've done. We still have primarily an employer-based system, but we now have people able to get subsidized insurance. So we have health insurance companies playing a major role in the provision of healthcare, both to the employed whose employers provide health insurance, and to those who are working but on their own are not able to afford it and their employers either don't provide it, or don't provide it at an affordable price. We are still struggling. We've made a lot of progress. Ten million Americans now have insurance who didn't have it before the Affordable Care Act, and that is a great step forward. (Applause.) And what we're going to have to continue to do is monitor what the costs are and watch closely to see whether employers drop more people from insurance so that they go into what we call the health exchange system. So we're really just at the beginning. But we do have Medicare for people over 65. And you couldn't, I don't think, take it away if you tried, because people are very satisfied with it, but we also have a lot of political and financial resistance to expanding that system to more people. So we're in a learning period as we move forward with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. And I'm hoping that whatever the shortfalls or the glitches have been, which in a big piece of legislation you're going to have, those will be remedied and we can really take a hard look at what's succeeding, fix what isn't, and keep moving forward to get to affordable universal healthcare coverage like you have here in Canada.

The video culminates with these claims, which appear in red letters: ""6.4 million more Americans living in poverty under President Obama"" and ""over 90 rounds of golf.""We’ve already checked the sporty part of that claim, rating as True the statement that Obama has played more than 90 rounds of golf since he became president. Here, we’ll focus on Dewhurst’s claim that the ranks of the poor have grown by 6.4 million.As backup, Dewhurst’s campaign sent us a January 2012 editorial from the conservative Washington Examiner that says ""there are 6.4 million more Americans in poverty today than when Obama took office.""Dewhurst’s campaign also pointed us to a page from the website of the Senate Republican Conference, which consists of Republican members of the U.S. Senate. The page — dated April 2, 2012, and titled ""He’s Made it Worse: The Obama Economic Record"" — is presented as a comparison of conditions when Obama became president and ""today"" according to statistics such as the unemployment rate and the size of the federal debt.Under ""Americans in Poverty,"" the page says there were 39.8 million on Obama’s inauguration day (Jan. 20, 2009) and are 46.2 million ""today."" The difference: 6.4 million people.The page does not give a source for the poverty numbers, so we turned to the U.S. Census Bureau, which is the official federal source of poverty statistics. The bureau uses a measure of poverty called the ""poverty thresholds"" to help determine the number of U.S. residents living in poverty. If a family has an income below the relevant threshold, then the members of that family are considered to be living in poverty.The bureau’s thresholds, which are adjusted annually for inflation, vary by family size. For example, the preliminary figures for 2011, which are the most recent thresholds, show that a family of four people would be considered to be living in poverty if it earned less than $23,018 through the year. Alternatively, the 2011 threshold for single people younger than 65 is $11,702.The bureau’s thresholds are different from the poverty guidelines overseen by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which are used to determine if applicants are eligible for government assistance programs.Census Bureau spokesman Robert Bernstein told us that the bureau estimates the number of U.S. residents living in poverty on an annual basis. The figure is based on a survey of a scientifically selected sample of about 100,000 households that takes place between February and April each year.The survey asks respondents their income for the previous year. And from the survey results, the bureau extrapolates the number of U.S. residents that were living in poverty that year.The 2010 poverty statistics were released in September 2011. The next estimate of the number of U.S. residents living in poverty, for 2011, is scheduled for release in September 2012.We should note that there have long been concerns about the bureau’s measure, which determines a person or family’s poverty status based on before-tax cash income. One of the primary identified weaknesses with this method is that it does not take into account government policies or benefits that can shrink a family’s income (such as payroll taxes) or enhance it (such as food stamps). Another criticism: The thresholds are not adjusted to account for variations in the cost of living in different places.We checked the bureau’s poverty figures to compare with the Senate Republican Conference’s data and found that the group was comparing the number of Americans in poverty in 2008 to the number in 2010. In other words, the Senate group used the bureau’s 2008 statistic — 39.8 million — for the number of people in poverty on Obama’s inauguration day in January 2009. And it used the 2010 statistic — 46.2 million, the most recent — for its count of poor Americans in April 2012.The bureau data show that the estimated number of U.S. residents in poverty in 2010, Obama’s second year in office, was greater by 6.4 million than it was in 2008, George W. Bush’s final full year in office. The largest increase came in 2009, Obama’s first year in office, when the poverty total was 3.8 million higher than the year before. In 2010, the number was 2.6 million greater than the 2009 level.The 46.2 million residents in poverty in 2010 amounted to the greatest number of Americans in the low-income category since the government started tracking the statistic in 1959.But the recent increase did not start on Obama’s watch. The number of Americans living in poverty, by the bureau’s measure, first creeped up in 2007, when 800,000 more people were in poverty than the year before. The subsequent 2008 increase: 2.5 million people.In fact, during Bush’s eight years as president, the estimated number of Americans in poverty rose every year but two. We applied the Dewhurst campaign’s methodology to the Bush years, comparing the number of people in poverty the year before Bush took office (2000) with the number during his last full year in office (2008). We found an increase of 8.2 million people.In making such comparisons, though, there is another, better way to judge change.As PolitiFact noted in a previous fact-check , because of population growth, it’s important to notice shifts in the share of all residents in poverty. And during the years Dewhurst focused on, the portion of U.S. residents in poverty increased, although like the estimated number of people in poverty, the climb began in 2007. The figures:** 2006: 12.3 percent** 2007: 12.5 percent (0.2 percentage point increase)** 2008: 13.2 percent (0.7 percentage point increase)** 2009: 14.3 percent (1.1 percentage point increase)** 2010: 15.1 percent (0.8 percentage point increase)The 2010 poverty rate of 15.1 percent was higher than that of every year for more than four decades, save two — 1983, when the rate was 15.2 percent, and 1993, when it was the same as the 2010 figure, 15.1 percent.A September 2011 New York Times news article about the 2010 poverty statistics said economists pointed to joblessness associated with the 2008 financial collapse and subsequent recession as the main factor pushing more Americans into poverty.A final note: Dewhurst implies that Obama is to blame for the rising number of people in poverty.But our sense is that it’s unfair to place all the responsibility in the president’s lap. The economic downturn began before Obama took office. Also, poverty experts such as Sheldon Danziger, director of the National Poverty Center at the University of Michigan, say that more Americans would have been forced into poverty without the 2009 federal stimulus plan, championed by Obama, which included billions of dollars for programs that help low-income Americans such as Medicaid and unemployment insurance. More broadly, no single official controls the number of Americans living in poverty.Our rulingDewhurst’s figures draw from a reliable source on Americans in poverty in 2010 — which, of course, is not 2012 — compared with 2008, the year before Obama became president.A better understanding of the extent of U.S. poverty lies in looking at the share of Americans in dire straits. That measure also supports Dewhurst’s point — that poverty has increased during Obama’s term. Then again, the percentage of residents in poverty had begun to grow in 2007, two years before Obama’s first in office.Finally, it’s a reach to say Obama is personally to blame for the increase in poverty.On balance, we rate Dewhurst’s statement Half True.Advertisement"	1.0

Her story was well known to independent counsel Ken Starr, to House impeachment managers, to Washington insiders and Capitol Hill reporters. A month ago, she gave an interview to NBC News correspondent Lisa Myers. Since then NBC News has been carefully investigating this story — combing through state records, court documents and newspapers, cross-checking dates and events, talking to more than 80 people, and repeatedly requesting information from the White House.LAST WEEK, as NBC News continued its investigation, Jane Doe Number 5 went public with her extraordinary allegation — that she was sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton 21 years ago. To some this is an old and unprovable accusation that should never have been circulated to begin with. To others it’s a story that must be told. Is she to be believed? Or is Jane Doe Number 5 the latest weapon in a relentless political war against Bill Clinton?Juanita Broaddrick: “It’s important to me to tell what happened. I don’t know how people are going to take this. I don’t know what they’re going to think after all these years and months why I’ve come forward.”Jane Doe Number 5 is 56-year-old Juanita Broaddrick, a successful businesswoman who has been the subject of intense political and media speculation. Rumors about Broaddrick’s story have been floating around Arkansas and Washington for years, known to both Clinton haters and supporters.Broaddrick was pulled into the Paula Jones case, she met with investigators for the House Judiciary Committee and was interviewed by Ken Starr’s investigators. And though what she told Starr remains sealed it was seen by 40 members of Congress before the impeachment vote in the House. Later House Republican Whip Tom Delay publicly urged senators to find out what Jane Doe Number 5 had to say before deciding the fate of the president.As the whispers about her grew, Broaddrick found herself hounded by the media — and she says she was the subject of gossip and half truths on the Internet and in the tabloids.Juanita Broaddrick: “All these stories are floating around. Different stories of what really happened, of what people think happened and I was tired of everybody putting their own spin on it.”The Broaddrick story became public last week, and since then her story has appeared in print, on radio and TV.But much of what you may have read or heard is incomplete. While NBC News was investigating this story and seeking comment from the White House, our work became the subject of much speculation.Tonight, you’ll see what we were able to learn and you’ll hear from Juanita Broaddrick herself — a woman who remained silent for two decades and who admits she has lied under oath about this story in the past but now says she wants to tell the truth.Juanita Broaddrick’s story begins in 1978 — she was a registered nurse who had started her own nursing home in Van Buren, Arkansas. Bill Clinton was the state attorney general who was running for governor:Juanita Broaddrick: “I thought he was just something that was gonna be really good for Arkansas. Thought he was a very charismatic man, that had bright ideas for our state… I just really liked him.”Broaddrick, whose married name at the time was Juanita Hickey, says she was so impressed with Clinton she volunteered to hand out bumper stickers and signs — her first and only political campaign. Broaddrick says she met Clinton for the first time when he made a campaign stop at her nursing home in the spring of 1978.Juanita Broaddrick: “While he was there visiting, he said ‘If you’re ever in the, ah you know, Little Rock area, please drop by our campaign office,’ and he said ‘be sure to call me when you come in and call down to the campaign office.’”Broaddrick says not long after that conversation she did go to Little Rock for a nursing home meeting held at the Camelot Hotel — now the Doubletree. She says she checked into the hotel and the next morning called Clinton campaign headquarters. She says she was told Clinton was at his apartment and to call him there.Juanita Broaddrick: “I did call and ask him if he was gonna be at the headquarters that day and he said no he didn’t plan to be there. He says, Clinton said, ‘Why don’t I just meet you for coffee in the Camelot coffee shop?’”But Broaddrick says Clinton called later — she thinks it was around 9 in the morning — and asked if they could meet in her hotel room because there were reporters in the coffee shop.Lisa Myers: “Did you think his interest in you at the time was personal or professional?”Juanita Broaddrick: “I thought it was professional, completely.”Myers: “So you thought this was going to be a business meeting?”Broaddrick: “Yes I did, I really did.”Myers: “Did you have qualms at all about him coming to the room?”Broaddrick: “I was a little bit uneasy. But, I felt, ah, a real friendship toward this man and I didn’t really feel any, um any danger in him coming to my room. I sort of ushered us over to the coffee — I had coffee sitting on a little table over there by the window and it was a real pretty window view that looked down at the river. And he came around me and sort of put his arm over my shoulder to point to this little building and he said he was real interested if he became governor to restore that little building and then all of a sudden, he turned me around and started kissing me. And that was a real shock.”Myers: “What did you do?”Broaddrick: “I first pushed him away and just told him ‘No, please don’t do that,” and I forget, it’s been 21 years, Lisa, and I forget exactly what he was saying. It seems like he was making statements that would relate to ‘Did you not know why I was coming up here?’ and I told him at the time, I said, ‘I’m married, and I have other things going on in my life, and this is something that I’m not interested in.’”Myers: “Had you, that morning, or any other time, given him any reason to believe you might be receptive?”Broaddrick: “No. None. None whatsoever.”Myers: “Then what happens?”Broaddrick: “Then he tries to kiss me again. And the second time he tries to kiss me he starts biting my lip (she cries). Just a minute... He starts to, um, bite on my top lip and I tried to pull away from him. (crying) And then he forces me down on the bed. And I just was very frightened, and I tried to get away from him and I told him ‘No,’ that I didn’t want this to happen (crying) but he wouldn’t listen to me.”Myers: “Did you resist, did you tell him to stop?”Broaddrick: “Yes, I told him ‘Please don’t.’ He was such a different person at that moment, he was just a vicious awful person.”Myers: “You said there was a point at which you stopped resisting?”Broaddrick: “Yeah.”Myers: “Why?”Broaddrick: “It was a real panicky, panicky situation. I was even to the point where I was getting very noisy, you know, yelling to ‘Please stop.’ And that’s when he pressed down on my right shoulder and he would bite my lip.”Broaddrick also says the waist of her skirt and her pantyhose were torn.Juanita Broaddrick: “When everything was over with, he got up and straightened himself, and I was crying at the moment and he walks to the door, and calmly puts on his sunglasses. And before he goes out the door he says ‘You better get some ice on that.’ And he turned and went out the door.”Myers: “On your lip?”Broaddrick: “Yeah.”Broaddrick estimates Clinton was in her room less than 30 minutes.Myers: “Is there any way at all that Bill Clinton could have thought that this was consensual?”Broaddrick: “No. Not with what I told him, and with how I tried to push him away. It was not consensual.”Myers: “You’re saying that Bill Clinton sexually assaulted you, that he raped you.”Broaddrick: “Yes.”Myers: “And there is no doubt in your mind that that’s what happened?”Broaddrick: “No doubt whatsoever.”While the president and his lawyer declined to be interviewed on camera, through his lawyer the president did issue a statement saying any allegation he assaulted Broaddrick is “absolutely false” and when asked about it Wednesday the president said he had nothing to add to that statement.It’s important to note — and Broaddrick concedes — that aside from her, there are no witnesses and as far as we know, no one saw Clinton enter or leave Broaddrick’s room, or even the hotel. She took no photos, kept no evidence and the hotel has no records to confirm that she stayed there. However, Broaddrick does have a friend who backs up her story.Norma Kelsey did not want to be interviewed on camera. However she told us she did accompany Broaddrick on that business trip to Little Rock — they even shared a hotel room. Norma says when she left that morning Broaddrick told her she was planning to see Clinton. But Norma says when she called around lunchtime, Broaddrick was upset and crying so she returned to the room.Juanita Broaddrick: “Well, I was very emotional within an hour or so after it happened and then by the time Norma got back my whole top lip was turned out, was very swollen and very ugly looking.”Norma also says that Broaddrick’s lip and mouth were badly swollen, that her pantyhose had been ripped off and she says Broaddrick told her she had been sexually assaulted by Clinton.Myers: “Did you feel any internal injuries?”Broaddrick: “Of course. I felt, I felt, just the whole thing you can imagine of being violated. I felt, of course there was pain.”Myers: “Did you consider going to a doctor?”Broaddrick: “No. Not at all. I just wanted to get home. I just, ah, I wanted it to all go away. I wanted to just walk outta there and forget that it had never happened, because I felt very responsible that I had allowed him to come to my room.”Broaddrick says she decided to leave the hotel immediately without going to the nursing home meeting. She says after Norma helped ice her lip, the two of them left Little Rock and drove more than two hours back to Van Buren.Juanita Broaddrick: “We were still in shock, Lisa, over what had happened… It was like this is a horrible thing and I’m gonna wake up in a minute and this is not going to be true.”Norma told us on the drive back, Broaddrick was very, very upset and in shock and says Broaddrick blamed herself for letting Clinton in her room. And Broaddrick says she never considered going to the police — especially since Clinton was the Arkansas attorney general at the time.Myers: “The question everyone is going to ask is ‘Juanita, why didn’t you report this 21 years ago?’”Broaddrick: “I didn’t think anyone would believe me in the world.”If Juanita Broaddrick ever wanted to press charges against Bill Clinton, it’s too late. The statute of limitations in Arkansas is six years.If something did happen in that hotel room, who else knew about it? NBC News spent four weeks trying to confirm as many details as possible.Lisa Myers: “Did you tell your husband when you got home?”Juanita Broaddrick: “No, my husband never knew.”Juanita Broaddrick says that at the time of the alleged sexual assault her marriage was on the rocks. She says she never told her husband, Gary Hickey, about the alleged incident and told him the swollen lip was the result of an accident. Hickey tells NBC News he doesn’t recall either the injury or her explanation. At the time, she was having an affair with the man who would become her second husband — David Broaddrick — to whom she’s been married 18 years. She says she saw David and told him what happened soon after she returned home.Myers: “Did she have any visible injuries?”David Broaddrick: “Yes. She, uh, her top lip was black.”Myers: “As best you can remember, what did she tell you?”David Broaddrick: “Uh, like I said, I don’t remember the words but that she had been raped by Bill Clinton.”Myers: “Other than her lip, did she have any injuries?”David Broaddrick: “Just mentally she was in bad shape.”Juanita Broaddrick also says her affair with David made her even more reluctant to report the incident:Juanita Broaddrick: “I don’t think I would have been real honorable back then in the 70s to have been married and having this affair. I just didn’t think anyone would have believed me.”So who else did Broaddrick talk to?Three of her friends tell NBC News she told them about the alleged incident at the time: Susan Lewis...Susan Lewis: “It was very traumatic for her.”Louise Ma...Myers: “Did you urge her to report it?”Louise Ma: “No.”Myers: “Why not?”Louise Ma: “Because women were made victims at the time. And you know what the courts were like in that time period. It was always the woman’s fault.”And Jean Darden, the sister of Norma Kelsey, the woman who says she saw Juanita at the hotel. Both admit they have a serious reason not to like Bill Clinton — in 1981 as governor, Clinton commuted the life sentence of their father’s killer, making him eligible for parole.The stories her friends tell from 20 years ago are consistent — and Broaddrick herself says she recalls many details. For instance, the outfit she was wearing, the hotel room furnishings, and the time of year — spring. However, there is one important thing she does not remember — when the alleged incident happened: not the date, not even the month.Lisa Myers: “Some people would say, how can you not remember the specific date of an event as traumatic as this?”Juanita Broaddrick: “I really don’t have an answer for that except to say I remember the approximate time of year. I probably should remember the date, although it’s something I wanted to forget.”So NBC News tried to figure out the date of the alleged assault.Broaddrick gave us access to all the business and personal records she says she could find. We also checked public records, nursing home records and convention schedules.And indeed there was a nursing home meeting at the Camelot Hotel in Little Rock on April 25, 1978. Further, state records show Broaddrick got credit for a nursing home seminar that was held that day, April 25.So was Bill Clinton even in Little Rock on April 25, 1978? Despite our repeated requests, the White House would not answer that question and declined to release any information about his schedule.So we checked 45 Arkansas newspapers and talked to a dozen former Clinton staffers. We found no evidence that Clinton had any public appearances on the morning in question. Articles in Arkansas newspapers suggest he was in Little Rock that day.And remember the little building Broaddrick says Clinton pointed to just before the alleged assault in the hotel room? We checked that too, and in fact the Pulaski County jail was visible from rooms facing the river. It has since been demolished.But what happened after the alleged assault? It turns out, just three weeks later Broaddrick actually attended a Clinton fundraiser with her first husband.Myers: “Some people would wonder why you would go to a fundraiser for someone who you say sexually assaulted you. Couldn’t you have said you were sick or gotten out of it?”Broaddrick: “I think I was still in denial that time exactly what had happened to me. I still felt very guilty at that time that it was my fault. By letting him come to the room I had given him the wrong idea and just shut up and accept your punishment and don’t ever do it again.”Broaddrick also told us Clinton called her a half dozen times at the nursing home. She says he got through once and asked her when she was coming back to Little Rock. Her response, she says, “I’m not.”Then in 1979, a year after the alleged assault, Broaddrick was named by Clinton to a non-paying position on a state advisory board.Myers: “Did you have reservations about accepting any appointment by Governor Clinton?”Broaddrick: “Yes, but I had more or less said to the association that I would do this before I knew it was a governor appointing job. When I agreed to do it I had no idea it was an appointment.”Over the years, Broaddrick said she had business dealings with the governor’s office but not Clinton personally. In 1984, she received a letter signed by Clinton after her nursing home was named one of the state’s best facilities. At the bottom, there is a handwritten note that says, “I admire you very much.” A routine political thank you? She interprets it as a thank you for her silence.In 1990, Clinton honored one of the patients at the nursing home, but Broaddrick says she wasn’t there, and didn’t learn of the visit until after the fact.Broaddrick says she had no face-to-face contact with Clinton until 1991, when she attended a meeting in Little Rock with two friends. They all say it was a nursing home meeting — but none can remember the date, nor do they have any records — so we can’t confirm it.Broaddrick does remember that she was suddenly called out of the meeting, and, she says, to her surprise, there was Bill Clinton in the hallway. One friend says she saw them talking:Broaddrick: “And he immediately began this profuse apology, saying, ‘Juanita, I’m so sorry for what I did. I’m not the man that I used to be, can you ever forgive me? What can I do to make this up to you?’ And I’m standing there in absolute shock. And I told him to go to hell, and I walked off.”But Broaddrick remained silent when she learned soon after that Clinton was making a bid for the Oval Office.Myers: “Here the man is running for president, doesn’t the country have a right to know this?”Broaddrick: “Yes, and that’s what I got to thinking about — David and I talked about it. We talked about it, and I cried about it. It brought up a lot of hurt, and a lot of things that I’d buried years ago. And then we just decided it wouldn’t be in our best interest to do it. So we decided not to.”In fact, Clinton’s political opponents say she rebuffed their efforts to get her to come forward before the 1992 election. After she turned them down, one of the men suggested she had been paid off.Myers: “Did you receive any payoff to stay silent?”Broaddrick: “Oh goodness, no. I mean how could anyone be bribed or paid-off for, for something that, to not say anything about something that horrible?”Myers: “Did Bill Clinton or anyone near him ever threaten you, try to intimidate you, do anything to keep you silent?”Broaddrick: “No.”Myers: “This has been strictly your choice.”Broaddrick: “Yes.”Broaddrick says she was determined to keep the incident quiet.But in 1997, her hand was forced when she was subpoenaed by Paula Jones’ lawyers.She filed an affidavit in that case — under oath as Jane Doe 5 — denying any “unwelcome sexual advances” by Clinton. She said “These allegations are untrue,” and “there is no truth to the rumors.”Broaddrick: “I didn’t want to be forced to testify about one of the most horrific events in my life. I didn’t want to go through it again.”She later told the same story, denying the assault, in a sworn deposition in the Jones case.Myers: “Last March another woman comes forward, Kathleen Willey, accuses the president of unwanted sexual advances — why didn’t you come forward?”Broaddrick: “Well Lisa, I would get up in the morning and I would think: it’s the thing to do. Then by nighttime I would think that could bring no good whatsoever to my life. And I’m sorry for these women. I’m sorry for what they went through, but I just wasn’t brave enough to do it. There’s nothing else to say.”But she changed her mind and changed her story, when Independent Counsel Ken Starr’s office approached her last April — investigating wrong-doing in the Jones case.Broaddrick says she feared lying to a federal grand jury, and once Starr granted her immunity from prosecution for perjury — she agreed to come forward with details of her allegations against Clinton.But Starr did not pursue the allegations further because he was investigating obstruction of justice charges against the president. Broaddrick never alleged any obstruction — said the president never urged her to lie — so Starr didn’t pursue the allegations any further.Finally, after months of contact with us, Broaddrick decided to speak to NBC News, on Jan. 20, in the middle of the Senate impeachment trial.Myers: “Then why now Juanita?”Broaddrick: (Very emotional) “I just couldn’t hold it in any longer. I didn’t want [my] granddaughters and nieces, when they’re 21 years old to turn to me and say, ‘Why didn’t you tell what this man did to you?’”We repeatedly asked the White House what it knew about Juanita Broaddrick — about her character or possible motivation. We got no response.We checked with local and federal law enforcement officials, who told us she’s a solid citizen with no criminal record and that they take her allegations very seriously.Broaddrick knows that some people have suggested her injuries 21 years ago were inflicted not by Clinton, but by her first husband, Gary Hickey.Divorce papers obtained by NBC News show that one year after the alleged assault by Clinton, Juanita and Hickey had an altercation. She says Hickey struck her in the mouth. He told NBC News it was an accident. Broaddrick says that is the only time her husband hit her, and there are no records of any earlier incident.Could Broaddrick have a financial motive — is she hoping to cash in? She says she and her husband are financially comfortable, have turned down any offer to tell her story for money, and have no plans for anything else.Myers: “No book deal?”Broaddrick: “No book deal.”Myers: “No lawsuit?Broaddrick: “Absolutely not. I don’t want to sue Bill Clinton and I do not want to write a book.”Finally, did Broaddrick have any other motivation for going public now with her allegations? Were politics behind the decision? Broaddrick’s personal attorney is a Republican state senator in Arkansas, but he says he did not know she decided to go public until she talked to NBC. Broaddrick says she is not registered with any political party — and the Broadrricks say they have donated money to both Republican and Democratic candidates.Myers: “What is the purpose? Do you want to destroy the president?”Broaddrick: “No, I don’t want to do anything. I do not have an agenda. I want to put all these rumors to rest. I buried this a long time ago, Lisa, and the only thing I’m trying to do now is clear up all these stories.”But after all this time, how does Juanita Broaddrick feel about Bill Clinton?Broaddrick: “I couldn’t say it on the air. My hatred for him is overwhelming.”Overwhelming enough to invent a story, to distort a memory, all to destroy a presidency? Absolutely not, she says.Myers: “Twenty years after it happened, having never reported it to authorities, after signing an affidavit denying anything ever happened, now you come forward. You understand how skeptical people may be?”Broaddrick: “Certainly I can. But I was also afraid what would happen to me if I came forward. I was afraid that I would be destroyed like so many of the other women have been.”Myers: “Do you understand the enormity of what you’re saying? To him and to you?”Broaddrick: “Yes I do. It’s been a long hard uphill battle to make these statements. But I feel like I have to. I feel like I have to make these statements now.”So now there is a face, a voice, a name for Jane Doe Number 5. Her story — just the rumor of it — has influenced politics and journalism, opened up her own life to public scrutiny and cast yet another shadow over the president, who denies the charge.In the end, the questions remain: Was it sexual assault? Could it have been consensual sex? Did anything happen at all? We may never know and that may be the unsatisfying ending to the story of Jane Doe Number 5.What won’t end is the debate over whether Juanita Broaddrick’s story is true — whether it has any political relevance, and whether the media, including NBC News, should have reported it.--Transcript courtesy of NBC News	1.0

He's led a very strong life, and I feel very badly.”Trump tried to equate Flynn's actions with those of his 2016 campaign opponent, Hillary Clinton, although the former Democratic presidential nominee has not been charged with lying to the FBI.“I will say this: Hillary Clinton lied many times to the FBI,” Trump said. “Nothing happened to her. Flynn lied, and they destroyed his life. I think it's a shame. Hillary Clinton, on the 4th of July weekend, went to the FBI, not under oath. It was the most incredible thing anyone's ever seen. She lied many times. Nothing happened to her. Flynn lied, and it's like they ruined his life. It's very unfair.”Trump was referencing Clinton's closed-door interview with the FBI in July 2016, as part of the bureau's investigation into her use of a private email server as secretary of state.Although the FBI's probe and the circumstances of Clinton's interview have drawn criticism, Clinton has not been charged with providing false statements to the bureau. White House spokesmen did not immediately respond to a request to substantiate Trump's allegation that she had “lied many times” to the FBI.[ Trump lawyer says president knew Flynn had given FBI the same account he gave to vice president ]Trump's Monday morning appearance before reporters was brief. He did not respond to shouted questions from journalists about when he first found out that Flynn lied to the FBI, nor did he answer queries about his endorsement of Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore, who stands accused of making unwanted sexual advances on teenage girls when he was in his 30s.[ Trump: ‘We need Republican Roy Moore to win in Alabama’ ]Flynn pleaded guilty Friday to lying to the FBI about his contacts with then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn said he had agreed to cooperate with special counsel Robert S.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)If it weren’t for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, there likely wouldn’t yet be an Iran nuclear deal, according to the former Secretary of State .While her Republican rivals who oppose the Iran deal might use that line against her, Clinton has touted progress with Iran as one of the hallmarks of her tenure at the State Department.""I spent 18 months putting together the sanctions against Iran so that we could force them to the negotiating table,"" she said at the MSNBC Democratic forum Nov. 6.She’s said this line a few times throughout her campaign, so we decided to dig into it.According to her campaign, Clinton was referring to her first 18 months as secretary -- from January 2009 to June 2010. During this time, U.S. and global sanctions on Iran increased, it’s fair to say that Clinton and the State Department played a major role in this development.The invitationUpping sanctions on Iran was a clear priority for Clinton’s State Department. She talked at length about the importance of pressuring Iran to discontinue nuclear activity, including through sanctions, at her nomination hearing in January 2009. She and other members of President Barack Obama’s administration regularly spoke publicly about the topic throughout her first 18 months in office.During this time period, the State Department -- top aides and Clinton herself -- led the diplomatic lobbying effort to get other countries to join the U.S. plan to pressure Iran, overcoming large hurdles such as getting Russia and China to get on board. In her memoir Hard Choices, Clinton recalls hashing out final details of a plan over drinks with a Chinese official.In June 2010, the United Nations Security Council approved tough new sanctions on Iran -- including expanding an arms embargo and restricting certain financial and shipping enterprises. At the time, Obama called them ""the toughest sanctions ever faced by the Iranian government.""Those sanctions enabled even tougher measures from the United States and the European Union , which were passed immediately. Congress passed several more bills containing additional sanctions on Iran during the rest of Clinton’s tenure, which ended in early 2013.While the Treasury is the primary agency responsible for enforcing sanctions, Clinton appointed a special adviser in 2010 to oversee U.S. efforts ""to ensure full and effective implementation of all U.N. Security Council resolutions related to Iran, including most recently UNSCR 1929.""Experts told us that Clinton is correct to take some of the credit for the rapid increase in international sanctions on Iran, and these sanctions were a big part of the reason why Iran rejoined multilateral talks about its nuclear program.The RSVPThe State Department was key to getting other countries to go along with and add to U.S. efforts to pressure Iran, said Patrick Clawson, senior fellow and research director at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. He added that her claim doesn’t give enough credit to other players but is essentially correct.Clawson specifically noted that he is ""not a fan nor a political supporter of Clinton.""The international sanction ramp-up ""shocked Iran's leaders,"" Clawson said. ""Besides the pain the sanctions inflicted, they raised the possibility more -- worse -- was coming. That was a key factor pushing Iran to resume more serious talks.""There is room for subjective interpretation on who deserves the credit for effective sanctions because many corners of the U.S. government are involved in the Iran effort, said Suzanne Maloney, deputy director of the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution. But the State Department had its hands in every aspect of new sanction-making and implementation, she said.And in the absence of the United Nations resolution -- Clinton’s lobbying success -- it would have been challenging to get a global coalition to significantly ramp up the sanctions, she said.But whether sanctions were a big factor in bringing Iran to the negotiating table is not crystal clear, Maloney said. Iranian officials have historically denied the significance of sanctions, but Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said recently that Iran negotiated the deal specifically to have sanctions lifted.Beyond the multilateral effort, Clinton’s team also played a role in the sanctions that Congress passed, said Richard Nephew, an expert on sanctions with the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. Lawmakers would not have written that legislation without consulting the State Department and the administration (as evidenced in this 2010 New York Times article ). Nephew noted, though, that Congress did pass some sanctions that went further than the administration’s wishes.""Without Secretary Clinton's good diplomacy -- and the message that she radiated down the system to make this a priority and so forth -- you can argue that the reductions would not have been as steep or as lasting,"" Nephew said.Congress’ sanctions that affect Iran’s oil exports resulted in a 50 percent reduction in oil exports and were instrumental in getting Iran to the negotiating table, said Nephew, who worked at the State Department under Clinton.Our rulingClinton said, ""I spent 18 months putting together the sanctions against Iran so that we could force them to the negotiating table.""Clinton’s claim is for the most part accurate, though a little exaggerated. During her first 18 months as secretary, the State Department was at the helm of a global effort to increase sanctions on Iran, culminating in an important U.N. resolution. Clinton was personally involved in these diplomatic efforts and pushed them publicly. And experts said these sanctions, on top of other sanctions passed before and after, were crucial to getting Iran to the negotiating table.However, Clinton wasn’t singularly responsible for the sanctions, just as the sanctions passed under her watch likely weren’t singularly responsible for opening up Iran to talks.We rate her statement Mostly True.Advertisement"	1.0

We wondered whether he was correct.On the Jan. 2, 2011, edition of NBC's Meet the Press, Sen.-elect Pat Toomey, R-Pa., cited a striking statistic in urging the United States to lower its corporate tax rates.Asked by host David Gregory about possible areas where President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans can work together, Toomey suggested several areas, including taxes.""I think tax policy is a possible area, one with plenty of landmines but plenty of opportunities,"" Toomey said . ""Simplify the code, lower rates. We should be lowering corporate tax rates because we have the highest in the world right now."" (Later in the roundtable discussion, Yale Law School professor Stephen Carter repeated the statistic, but we'll check Toomey's quote here.)We wondered whether the U.S. really has the highest corporate tax rates in the world.Using the most straightforward definition of ""corporate tax rates,"" Toomey is right. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 32 large, industrialized democracies, ranks the ""combined corporate income tax rate"" in its member nations. That means the highest tax bracket for general corporate income, excluding taxes levied on specific products or services.For 2010, the U.S ranks second to Japan by a fraction of a percentage point -- 39.54 percent for Japan to 39.21 percent for the U.S. But that figure is already outdated: Japan has recently moved to cut its rate for 2011 by 5 percentage points, leaving the U.S. with the highest corporate tax rate among OECD nations.But before we declare Toomey's statement True, let's dig a little deeper.The OECD rate is the ""statutory"" rate -- that is, the top corporate tax rate on the books. But many companies pay considerably less than that, due to deductions and other exclusions. Adjusting for these factors produces a statistic called the ""effective tax rate.""The World Bank has assembled data from 183 nations and made a series of statistical adjustments to produce a full international comparison of effective tax rates. By this measurement, the U.S. rate is considerably lower than the published rate -- 27.6 percent. But in a comparative sense, that's still pretty high: Among larger international economies, only Japan, New Zealand and Thailand produced a higher effective rate in the World Bank study. And Japan's number should fall by the time next year's study comes out.The World Bank also produces another -- and broader -- statistic. This measure factors in not only the corporate profit tax but also a range of other taxes paid by businesses, including the cost of employee taxes borne by the employer. When the World Bank ranked countries from the lowest level of taxes to the highest, the U.S. ranked 124th out of 183 -- meaning corporate taxes were relatively high. A number of other large and/or democratic countries were higher, including Austria, Belgium, Brazil, China, France, Hungary, India, Italy, Spain and Sweden.This last measure provides a wider snapshot of U.S. tax policy toward businesses, but it also introduces some complications. Factoring in the employer-paid portion of labor taxes makes the corporate tax rate seem higher in countries that provide higher benefits such as pensions or health care through business taxes, while making the rate seem lower for countries that provide less generous benefits through the tax code. So making apples-to-apples comparisons can be tricky.There's also broader context that Toomey doesn't get into. In a previous item , we noted that when all taxes, including those such as personal income taxes and property taxes -- not just corporate taxes -- are taken into account and compared to gross domestic product, the U.S. doesn't rank near the top of the OECD table in total tax burden.Still, if you rate Toomey on his specific wording by looking at ""corporate tax rates,"" he's right that the U.S. does now have the highest corporate tax rates on the books, at least among the biggest industrialized democracies, which is most economists' typical yardstick. So we rate his statement Mostly True.Advertisement"	1.0

The candidates approach to meeting those goals could not be more different, however. ""Ohio is heading for quite a crisis unfortunately we did not have the focus on job creation in the last session that we should have,"" said incumbent 69th House Representative Bill Batchelder. ""We sent 20 bills addressing job creation and expansion, but we should have been cutting back more on the appropriations level than we were, but as the minority party, we had no control over that."" Batchelder, who has been mentioned as a possible choice for Speaker of the House should the Republicans Party gain control, is serving the second term of his second time in the house. He previ ously served for 30 years up until 2008, when term limits forced him to give up the seat. He has also served as a judge on the Medina County Common Pleas Court and the Ninth District Court of Appeals. Addressing the deficit, which now accounts for roughly 20 percent of the entire state budget, will be a ""huge problem"" facing the next House of Representatives in their first six months, Batchelder said, adding that several tough battles must be waged to meet this goal. He pointed specifically to seeking Federal waiers for participation in the Medicaid program, potentially via offsets for indigent services provided at facilities like MetroHealth Medical Center. ""There are all kinds of things like that which we haven't done a good job of cataloguing,"" Batchelder said. ""And the Federal government has arbitrary authority over granting waivers."" Batchelder also supports looking at the privatization of some medical services now done by public employees. ""Many of these services are now done by people who are being paid higher than those in the private sector,"" Batchelder said. He did not, however, indicate specifically which public-sector jobs he would consider making cuts to, or how many of those jobs would be impacted by such a move. ""We will be holding a lot of hearings and we will have to solve it in six months, when the budget must be in,"" he said. On the growth side of the equation, Batchelder said enhancing the state's Department of Development by encouraging the direct input of participation of business owners is key to job growth. ""We are competing with Indiana and their economy is growing,"" Batchelder said. ""It doesn't help that our Department of Development has been through three or four directors in the same number of years. But we have got to get guys in there from successful businesses who can tell us what they need. National Cash Register is a company that was here for 100 years and now they are in Atlanta shouldn't we find out what companies like that need instead of having the government tell us what they need?"" To provide an immediate shot in the state's economic arm, Batchelder said there should be more of a focus on the needs of industries such as medical and metalworking.""We are starting to see a real philosophical difference between those who feel the government can create jobs and those who feel that only the private sector can,"" Batchelder said. ""These 'green jobs' are generational, they are not something that will be ready next week or even next year. All of these things are planned for the future there are a lot of ribbons being cut but not a lot of production. You can't starve on your way to the green job.""Batchelder said Medina County is particularly poised to play a major role in this short-term recovery focus. ""When we create the jobs, it's also important to have people trained to do them,"" he said. ""So again, we have to find out from the business community what those needs are, then use or facilities such as the Akron University branch and the Medina County Career Center for that training."" That sort of business focus has begun to resonate with an increasingly weary electorate, in Batchelder's view.""I think people are not so much looking for hope and change as nuts and bolts that maybe we need to be more business focused in order to put this economy back together,"" he said. ""We haven't had control of the House for the last two years and it's been malfunctioning, we had 109 session scheduled and held 49."" Batchelder said that in spite of the fact that Ohio is in ""the worst shape since the Depression"" economically, having such a focus will turn around the state's fortunes. ""We need people who will roll up their sleeves to do the legislative work that needs done,"" he said. ""There is no doubt in my mind we are in the position to do that.""

DelReal By Jenna Johnson and Jose A. DelReal Email the author February 20, 2016 Email the author Follow @wpjenna Follow jdelrealThis story has been updated.NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. — To explain his support for waterboarding and other heavy-handed interrogation tactics, Donald Trump told a rally audience a story Friday night that involved U.S. Gen. John J. Pershing, a terrorist attack in the Philippines more than a century ago, 50 terrorists and bullets dipped in pigs’ blood.It’s a tale that has circulated on the Internet for years — and is most likely not true.The story came up as Trump reiterated his support for waterboarding, the advanced interrogation technique that the Obama administration considers torture and has ceased using. Earlier this week, Trump said he supports this controversial method, along with those that are “much worse,” because “torture works.” Proponents of waterboarding have long been careful to not label it as torture, which is strictly forbidden by U.S. and international law.[ Donald Trump: 'Torture works' ]“The big question is: Is it torture or not?” Trump said at a rally at a convention center here, the night before the South Carolina primary. “It’s so borderline. It’s like your minimal, minimal, minimal torture.”Trump criticized his Republican rivals for not embracing waterboarding as enthusiastically as he has, which he says sends the wrong message to terrorists who use barbaric techniques like chopping off the heads of their foes.“You know, I read a story — it’s a terrible story, but I’ll tell you,” Trump said. “Should I tell you? Or should I not?”As the crowd cheered him on, Trump told them about Pershing — “rough guy, rough guy” — who was fighting terrorism in the early 1900s. Trump didn't say where this happened, but variations of this story online usually state that it happened in the Philippines during the Philippine-American War — part of the island nation's protracted battle for independence — early in Pershing’s career.“They were having terrorism problems, just like we do,” Trump said. “And he caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people. And he took the 50 terrorists, and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pigs’ blood — you heard that, right? He took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs’ blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said: You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years, there wasn’t a problem. Okay? Twenty-five years, there wasn’t a problem.”At one point in telling this story, Trump said: “By the way, this is something you can read in the history books — not a lot of history books because they don’t like teaching this.”[ Donald Trump’s final pitch to South Carolina ]Although Trump never used the word “Muslim” in this story, he was clearly referring to Muslim terrorists and at one point commented: “There’s a whole thing with swine and animals and pigs, and — you know the story, you know they don’t like that.” Pigs are deemed impure by the Koran.Trump finished the story with this message: “So we better start getting tough, and we better start getting vigilant, and we better start using our heads, or we’re not going to have a country, folks. We’re not going to have a country.”A guy in the audience then shouted: “This is the greatest country in the world.”While the story was well received by the cheering audience, it appears to be more of a military fable than a history lesson. The website snopes.com — which investigates urban legends, myths, rumors and pretty much anything forwarded in a chain email — could find little proof that the story is true.There are several versions of the tale circulating, including one in which the prisoners were buried with dead pigs. The pigs’ blood on the bullets, according to at least one version, would keep a Muslim from entering heaven.The Council on American-Islamic Relations denounced Trump's remarks Saturday in a sharply worded statement that accused the billionaire of inciting anti-Muslim attacks. The group has frequently tussled with Trump over anti-Muslim rhetoric, including Trump's call to temporary prevent all Muslims from entering the country.""Donald Trump's inflammatory rhetoric has crossed the line from spreading hatred to inciting violence,"" said Nihad Awad, national executive director of CAIR. ""By directly stating that the only way to stop terrorism is to murder Muslims in graphic and religiously-offensive ways, he places the millions of innocent, law-abiding citizens in the American Muslim community at risk from rogue vigilantes.""Republican presidential rival Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) called the story ""bizarre"" and questioned its historical authenticity.""I'm sure people are offended — I hope people are offended by that. That's not what the United States is about,"" Rubio said on NBC's ""Today"" show on Saturday morning. ""Look, we're in a very weird year here. And obviously things are going on, people are saying whatever they want in politics today and there seems to be no accountability.""""The presidency is a serious job … and so I hope we can get this campaign back focused on the serious aspect of it and not the circus aspect of it,"" Rubio added.Trump’s campaign had yet to respond to a request for comment Saturday afternoon.The real estate mogul found himself mired in multiple controversies in the days leading to Saturday's South Carolina primary. On Friday, he called for a boycott of Apple products over the tech firm's refusal to assist the FBI in unlocking an iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino, Calif., shooters. On Thursday, he had sharp words for Pope Francis after the holy leader seemingly condemned Trump's calls to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.The billionaire tweeted a message Saturday morning that knocked President Obama for not attending Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia's funeral — and echoed past statements made by himself and others questioning the president's Christian faith.""I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque? Very sad that he did not go!"" Trump tweeted. DelReal reported from Greenville, S.C.Jenna Johnson is a White House correspondent of The Washington Post.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz ,D-FL, Democratic National Committee Chairwoman, greets people at the Time Warner Cable Arena. (Getty Images)“It’s the message every one of you have heard,” said Ira Foreman, the man in charge of Jewish affairs for the Democratic National Committee. “that the president is awful on Israel.” After which he quickly added that the message was totally untrue. The Democrats have prepared one- and six-page versions of talking points, the latter of which is actually seven pages and provides “facts” in response to no less than 10 “myths.” The approximately 120 mostly Jewish Democrats didn’t quite fill the room and the crowd was much smaller than that at the Republican Jewish Coalition last week in Tampa (but that was on an official convention day and this wasn’t).Delaware Governor Jack Markell spoke briefly, citing just “public schools” and Israel as reasons to support Barack Obama. Evidence: Defense Minister Ehud Barak and President Shimon Peres have said relations between the U.S. and Israel have never been stronger. A word I believe I did not hear during the time I was in the meeting: Netanyahu.National Chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz spoke ans was warmly received as she extolled Obamacare (Democrats are using the term) and said she has heard Israel’s Ambassador Michael Oren say, in her words, “what the Republicans is dangerous for Israel.”The Obama campaign opinion research director spoke and presented a (by partisan standards) reasonably fair PowerPoint on the polls. He got vigorous applause when he praised Obama for bringing the troops home from Iraq and for having “restored science to its rightful place.” Which auggests to me that there’s still strong opposition to George W. Bush who launched the war in Iraq and blocked government funding of embryonic stem cell research (not all health research). In contrast, he has to milk applause from the audience on gay rights issues.I don’t remember a similar meeting at a Democratic National Convention before; perhaps I missed one or more. Either way, this struck me as a very defensive exercise. Audience members were asked to talk to their friends, but skip the “10 to 12%” who are strong Republicans and are “intelligent, accomplished, smart, very practiced debaters.” Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition is sending members from safe states to Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Obama got 78% of the Jewish vote last time and has been getting about 64% in polls of Jewish voters this year. I’m betting that he ends up closer to that number than to his 2008 number. That would reduce the Democratic margin (or increase the Republican margin), according to Foreman, by 83,500 in Pennsylvania, 41,500 in Pennsylvania, 19,000 in Ohio, 12,500 in Virginia, 11,500 in Colorado, 11,000 in Michigan and 9,500 in Nevada.Share your thoughts with friends.

Rick Perry’s years-ago switch from the Democratic to the Republican party Puts him in the same company as the nation’s 40th president.""You’re sort of like Ronald Reagan, you feel the Democratic Party left you?"" Hannity asked.Perry replied that he’d had a conversation with Reagan’s son Michael, a political consultant and former radio host. ""I told Michael Reagan the other day … ‘You know, I love your dad, and he was part of the reason I became a Republican,’ but I said, ‘I became a Republican sooner in my life than your dad did.’ ""Perry and Hannity shared a laugh over that. But that light moment left unresolved how old each leader was when he made his D-to-R leap. Did Perry beat Reagan to the flip point?We’ll take a look at Reagan first. In March 2010, PolitiFact Florida rated True the claim that ""Reagan was a Democrat before he was a Republican.""Historian Edward Yager, author of the 2006 biography Ronald Reagan’s Journey: Democrat to Republican, told PolitiFact Florida that Reagan, who was born Feb. 6, 1911, ""was registered Democrat from the time that he voted for (Democrat Franklin Roosevelt) in 1932, when he was 21.""Yager said that he hadn’t seen copies of Reagan’s voter registration cards but that ""virtually all the sources that refer to"" Reagan’s party affiliation indicate that he was registered as a Democrat. Yager also noted that Reagan ""has two autobiographies in which he refers to his voting for (Roosevelt) four times"" and then for President Harry Truman, a Democrat, in 1948.Later, while still a Democrat, Reagan began supporting Republican presidential candidates. Melissa Giller, director of communications and programs at Reagan’s presidential library, told PolitiFact Florida that Reagan endorsed the presidential candidacies of Republican Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956 — at ages 41 and 45, respectively — and Republican Richard Nixon in 1960 ""while remaining a Democrat.""Perry and other Republican presidential candidates are scheduled to debate at the Reagan library, in Simi Valley, Calif., on Sept. 7.The library’s website says Reagan registered as a Republican in the fall of 1962, when he was 51. According to the site, a woman interrupted Reagan while he was speaking in favor of Nixon’s unsuccessful gubernatorial bid in California to ask him whether he had yet to register as a Republican. ""When he said, ‘Well, no, I haven’t yet, but I intend to,’ down the center aisle through the audience came a woman who declared, ‘I’m a registrar,’ and placed a registration card in front of him,"" the site says. ""In front of his audience, Ronald Reagan officially joined the Republican Party.""In her 2010 email to PolitiFact Florida, Giller pointed to the famous Reagan quip that Hannity echoed on his show: ""I didn't leave the Democratic Party. The party left me.''Other studies of Reagan also trace his party switch to 1962, including Yager’s book and a 1982 Reagan biography by Lou Cannon, which says Reagan ""was an active Democrat"" in 1952, when he married Nancy Davis, ""and would remain a registered Democrat for another decade.""In 1962, Cannon writes, when Reagan was approached by California Republicans to help campaign on their behalf, he told them that he ""didn’t want to be a professional Democrat campaigning for the Republicans"" and would re-register as a Republican. ""He did so, at a subsequent political meeting where he spoke on behalf of the ill-fated Nixon campaign against Governor Edmund G. (Pat) Brown,"" Cannon writes.So, by several accounts, Reagan was 51 when he became a Republican, although he began backing GOP presidential candidates a decade earlier.How old was Perry, born March 4, 1950, when he made his move?We’ve looked at Perry’s political past in previous fact-checks , reporting that Perry won his first election as a Democrat, taking a West Texas House district seat in 1984, when Democrats controlled the Legislature and the state had had just one Republican governor since Reconstruction. He won re-election in 1986 and 1988 before switching parties in 1989 to challenge Democratic Agricultural Commissioner Jim Hightower in 1990 — a race that Perry won in an upset.The biography on Perry’s presidential campaign website agrees with that account.A July 14 Texas Tribune story says that during his years in the Texas House, Perry was far from liberal. ""Perry, a young rancher and cotton farmer, gained an early reputation as a fiscal conservative,"" the story says. ""He was one of a handful of freshman ‘pit bulls,’ so named because they sat in the lower pit of the House Appropriations Committee, where they fought to keep spending low.""The Tribune story says Perry announced he was changing parties on Sept. 29, 1989, during a press conference outside the Texas Capitol. ""I intend to vote the same convictions,"" Perry said then, according to the Tribune. ""The only difference is there will be an ‘R’ beside my name.""On the day of the press conference, Perry was 39 years old.We rate his statement as True.Advertisement"	1.0

He has also been offered a top post in the new White House Office of Health Reform, twin duties that could make him the most influential surgeon general in history.A practicing physician and one of People magazine's ""Sexiest Men Alive,"" Gupta met for more than two hours with Obama in Chicago on Nov. 25, according to two sources with knowledge of the talks. Gupta, 39, later spoke with several Obama advisers, including Thomas A. Daschle, who will run the new White House policy office and the Department of Health and Human Services.The globetrotting doctor has told Obama aides he wants the job, which involves overseeing the 6,000-member Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service. When reached yesterday, Gupta did not deny that he plans to accept the offer but declined to comment.Transition officials refused to speak on the record about his selection, but several Obama allies praised Gupta as the sort of highly visible, articulate physician who might restore the luster that the position of ""the nation's doctor"" had in the person of Reagan appointee C. Everett Koop and some of his predecessors.A representative of the Commissioned Corps, however, said Gupta will face a ""credibility gap"" because he has never served in the uniformed Public Health Service.""I am unaware of any public health experience or qualifications he has to be the leader of the nation's public health service,"" said Gerard M. Farrell, executive director of the service's Commissioned Officers Association. ""This would be akin to appointing the Army chief of staff from the city council of Hoboken,"" N.J.The selection of Gupta represents a ""return to a communicator model,"" said Susan Blumenthal, who retired as an assistant surgeon general two years ago after 20 years in the Public Health Service.If he is confirmed by the Senate, Gupta would provide the administration with a skilled television personality to help market what is planned to be a massive reorganization of the U.S. health system.The Obama team already has initiated a public relations campaign aimed at mobilizing grass-roots support for eventual health reform legislation. Last week, Daschle appeared at town-hall-style meetings in Indiana and Washington to solicit public input. The sessions, captured on video and posted on the transition Web site, were among more than 8,500 local gatherings held over the holidays.Gupta is ""a great voice to get the public engaged in the discussion over health care reform,"" said Kenneth Thorpe, a former Clinton administration official who has become friendly with Gupta as a colleague at Emory University in Atlanta.Gupta, the son of Indian parents, has long been drawn to policymaking. He was a White House fellow in the late 1990s, writing speeches and crafting policy for then-first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton . He is currently associate chief of neurosurgery at Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta's busy downtown hospital.CONTINUED 1 "	1.0

There are differences between myself and Senator Obama, and there are very big differences between myself and John McCain.And I have to admit to being somewhat surprised when I saw that Senator McCain had said that he would try to continue to privatize Social Security along the lines of what President Bush tried and failed in doing in 2005. And, you know, that is a very significant difference between the two of us.So I'd be glad to take your questions.QUESTION: How important is Social Security to the residents of western Pennsylvania? We saw a lot of older people here, and as we interviewed them we asked and they said that was a big issue. So how important is that?AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyCLINTON: Well, it's a big issue across the country. But Pennsylvania, as you know, has a higher percentage of older people than most states. So it's a particular concern to a lot of Pennsylvanians, who are on Social Security, you know, like the couple that we heard from earlier today who keep seeing their expenses increase and realize that they are in a very difficult position trying to afford all of the necessities of life and being on a fixed income like they are.Continue reading the main storyThat's why it's so important that we do everything we can to meet the long-term challenges of Social Security. The Social Security trustees just issued a report, actually while I was speaking, and there has been some improvement in the outlook for Social Security, according to the Social Security trustees. So I think that it reinforces what I've said for a long time, which is that we have some long-term challenges, it is not a crisis, we can fix what's, you know, needing to be changed in Social Security. Our real challenge is Medicare, which is much more in crisis and deserves closer attention.QUESTION: Now that Senator Obama has released his tax returns, will you release yours prior to April 15th, and will you release the entire documents along with the schedules and everything?CLINTON: Well, I anticipate being able to release them shortly, I hope within the next week. And I am pleased that Senator Obama has released his tax returns. I think that's a good first step. Now he should release his records from being in the state senate and any other information that the public and the press need to know from his prior experience, because I think that, you know, we should continue to make available the information that we have. And I will be releasing my tax returns.QUESTION: Should Barack Obama have left his church after Jeremiah Wright made the comments that he did?CLINTON: Well, I answered a question in an ed board today that was very specific about what I would have done. And, you know, I'm just speaking for myself. And I was answering a question that was posed to me.But I think, given all we have heard and seen, he would not have been my pastor.I gave a speech at Rutgers, about a year ago, that was triggered by the Don Imus comments.And I said that it was time for standing up for what is right, for saying enough is enough, for urging that we turn a culture of degradation into a culture of empowerment, for saying that, while we, of course, must protect our right to freedom of expression, it should not be used as a license or an excuse to demean and humiliate our fellow citizens.Senator Obama spoke eloquently, at that time, as well.You know, we don't have a choice when it comes to our relatives. We have a choice when it comes to our pastors and the churches we attend.Everyone will have to decide these matters for themselves. They are obviously very personal matters. But I was asked what I would do if he were my pastor. And I said I think the choice would be clear for me.AdvertisementQUESTION: Are you not satisfied with Senator Obama's explanation about his relationship with his pastor, in his speech, then?CLINTON: I was asked what I would do.QUESTION: Are you not satisfied with his response...CLINTON: Well, that's a question that goes to him. I was asked what I would do. And I answered what I would do.QUESTION: Senator, now that you're talk about this a little more publicly than you have, does this mean this is on the table, when you talk to superdelegates?Is it on the table in the Democratic primary?CLINTON: I was asked what I would do. And I answered the question.QUESTION: I'm with the student newspaper, and we had a mock election here. And Obama took it. Why do you think that your numbers aren't as strong with young people?And why do you think young people should vote for you?CLINTON: Well, I think they're getting better. You know, I was very pleased at the reception that I've gotten here in Pennsylvania. And, you know, I did very well with young people in Ohio, Massachusetts, California.I think, in the course of this campaign, over the next month, we'll be reaching out to young people.And this is an exciting election. It's wonderful that more young people are getting involved. I understand that there was an increase in registration for young people in Pennsylvania. So I intend to do everything I can to win as many votes as possible.But I think I've put forth very specific plans as to what I would do as president to deal with a lot of the problems that young people talk to me about, whether Social Security will be there, whether they'll be able to afford health care when they're no longer on their parents' policy, assuming that their parents have health insurance, how they'll afford college, what's going to happen in Iraq.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyCLINTON: So, I have been very specific and I'll continue to do so because I don't think that this should be just about the next election; I think it should be about the next generation.QUESTION: You misspoke regarding your trip to Bosnia, presumably about the sniper fire and running into the cars.After looking at the CBS video, that didn't -- exactly wasn't what happened.But on February 29th, when we were in Waco, you gave a similar account saying that there was sniper fire and that you were running into cars.Did you misspeak again, and what exactly -- how are Americans supposed to, sort of, take what happened here?CLINTON: You know, I made a mistake in describing it. I have said many times, I've talked about this many times that we were, you know, very much told by the Secret Service and the military that we were going into a war zone and that we had to be conscious of that. I was the first first lady taken into a war zone since Eleanor Roosevelt.And, you know, I think that the military and the Secret Service did a terrific job. But we certainly did take precautions. There is no doubt about that, and I remember that very clearly.But I did make a mistake in talking about it the last time and recently.But, look, this is really about what policy experience we have and who's ready to be commander in chief. And I'm happy to put my experience up against Senator Obama's any day.QUESTION: The people of Pennsylvania really support Ed Rendell and a lot of people are wondering what you think of him and if there's a possibility this he may be one of your choices for a running-mate, if you would secure the nomination.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyCLINTON: Well, it would be premature for me to talk about something like that but I am a big fan of Ed Rendell. I have been an admirer of his work when he was mayor of Philadelphia, now as governor. He has been visionary, effective, strong, provided the kind of leadership that Pennsylvania clearly has responded to very positively.And he's been ahead on a lot of the issues that are important from home foreclosures to energy. And I just think that he is an exceptional leader and I'm proud to have him on my team and leading my campaign in Pennsylvania.QUESTION: Republicans now saying that it's a pattern of exaggeration on Bosnia with the three events that they sent out with the same kind of story.How do you respond to that claim, that this is sort of a pattern that's developed?CLINTON: Well, I just disagree with that. You know, look, I made a mistake. And, you know, I had a different memory. And, you know, my staff and others have, you know, all kind of come together trying to sort out. So I made a mistake. That happens. It proves I'm human, which, you know, for some people, is a revelation.(LAUGHTER)QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) I'm curious what it was like to be inside the right-wing conspiracy?(LAUGHTER)Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

We had a wide-ranging discussion about a lot of domestic and foreign policy issues. And, you know, I said in the beginning when I arrived that it was obviously, somewhat counter intuitive for me to be there but it was a good discussion.QUESTION: You know, there are some in Washington who are saying the race is over. And some in the media are saying the race is over. And you made to say that you're going on. Are you receiving pressure to get out of the race or are you feeling...CLINTON: No, but I hear it in the atmosphere.CLINTON: But the most common thing that people say to me, it happened here, it happened last night, it happens everywhere now, is, ""Don't give up, keep going. We're with you."" And I feel really good about that because that's what I intend to do.QUESTION: Senator, can you talk about Tibet at all? Are you concerned about what's going on there?CLINTON: I am.Continue reading the main storyQUESTION: And specifically, should the U.S. consider not going to China for the Olympics as a result of this?CLINTON: Look, I think that what's happening in Tibet is deeply troubling. And this is a pattern of the Chinese government with respect to their treatment of Tibet. I actually raised that issue with Chinese leadership going back a number of years.I don't think we should wait until the Olympics to make sure that our views are known. And I think we should be speaking out through our administration now in a much more forceful way and, you know, supporting people in Tibet who are trying to preserve their culture and their religion from tremendous pressure by the Chinese.QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)CLINTON: Let's wait on that. I don't have an opinion about that.QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) home foreclosures and said that -- I don't know if you've seen the quote, but he said it is not the duty of the government to bail out and reward those who act irresponsibly, whether they be big banks or small borrowers. He basically was saying we should wait until the government steps in.We certainly heard your remarks yesterday, but what do you think about Senator McCain's?CLINTON: Well, it sounds remarkably like Herbert Hoover. And I don't think that's a good economic policy. You know, we have a framework of regulation. It needs to be updated and modernized.The government has a number of tools at its disposal that are well-suited for just this situation.CLINTON: And I think that inaction has contributed to the problems we face today. And I believe further inaction would exacerbate those problems.So I laid out what I would do, and I don't think it's an adequate response to say the government shouldn't be helping either banks or people. Because I think that would be a downward spiral that would cause tremendous economic pain and loss in our country. And I don't see why we should wait by for that to happen.QUESTION: Your campaign and your -- you and your campaign have been talking about Florida and Michigan, saying that Obama wants to disenfranchise voters there by not backing re-votes.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyIf this ends up going to the convention and the superdelegates decide, how is that not disenfranchising voters?CLINTON: Well, look, I think that what we have to wait and see is what happens in the next three months. And there's been a lot of talk about what-if, what-if, what-if. Let's wait until we get some votes.People are going to vote, over the next months. Millions of people are going to vote. And we should wait and see the outcome of those votes.QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)CLINTON: No, no, I didn't say that.QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)CLINTON: I was joking. I mean, you know, gosh, lighten up, guys. I mean, obviously, come on. I say millions of words every week, and there's a lot more, you know, room for error when you're talking as much as I'm talking, but, no.QUESTION: For the government to buy mortgages or even guarantee them, that's going to cost money. How do you do that and still be fiscally responsible, without, you know, increasing the deficit?CLINTON: Well, there are two things about that. One is, you know, the fund that I have proposed would be part of the stimulus package. Because I think we need a second stimulus, because we didn't do anything about housing, despite, you know, my strong urging that we do. And then it's important to realize that the plan that Barney Frank and Chris Dodd have talked about could very well be self- financing over time, so that, you know, within a certain number of years, the Treasury -- the budget would not be out any money.But that's why I want to bring in some outside experts, like I suggested yesterday, to help plan this.CLINTON: Because, obviously, this is uncharted waters. We haven't done anything like since the Great Depression when an agency was created and it did buy mortgages. We're not at that point yet. The congressional proposal is to auction them off to private buyers. I have my doubts as to whether that would work, so we need a backstop for some kind of a government purchasing potential as well.But I think you could do this over time in a way that was not damaging to the federal budget.Now, obviously, we have a lot of other damage we have to clean up inherited from President Bush and the Republican Congress. But I think this could be managed effectively.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyQUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) a step further, though, by saying that the federal housing authority could buy (OFF-MIKE).CLINTON: Right. Well, what I said is that I think that should be considered. You know, I support what Senator Dodd and Congressman Frank have proposed, but I'm just not convinced that it alone will work. I think it's part of a plan, but not the complete plan. That's why I want to get this emergency working group to come in and try to give us the best suggestions about how to proceed.I personally think we will have to have as a backstop the ability of the FHA or some federal entity to be able to buy, because you don't even know how many buyers are out there.And, remember, what we're asking is that people come in and bid in an auction on buying these mortgages. They have to believe, the people bidding, that they can make money out of it.The way you would have to make the money is that you'd have to negotiate with homeowners to help them get a payment plan that would actually keep them in their homes and give you a revenue stream that would be profitable.A lot of the potential buyers have no capacity to do that. You know, a hedge fund doesn't have people who can go out and talk to home buyers. They'd have to put that together. Whereas, the FHA and the government would be able much more easily to provide those services.So I think that the number and type of potential buyers in such an auction might not be sufficient for what it is we're facing.CLINTON: And that's why I thought there should be the back-up from the government to be able to buy and work out those mortgages by the government.QUESTION: Questioning or discussing someone's relationship with their pastor is a very personal matter. And as you know, there are some Democrats who are concerned about the tone of the campaign being negative, being personal. Are those concerns justified?AdvertisementAnd do your remarks which you carefully -- which you are careful to read...CLINTON: Right.QUESTION: Do you think those concerns are justified?CLINTON: Well, as I said, it is a very personal matter. And I was asked a personal question. And I responded as to what I would have done. And, you know, everybody has to answer that for themselves because it is a personal consideration. And obviously, you take into all -- into account all kinds of factors.But when asked a direct question, I gave a direct answer. And I feel very comfortable with that. I don't think that's negative. That's what I would have done. And other people can evaluate that for themselves and make their own conclusions as to what they would have done.CLINTON: Thank you."	1.0

One of its videos, recorded in secret and released July 14, 2015, shows members of the anti-abortion group posing as tissue brokers discussing terms for procuring fetal tissue.To some, it appeared that Planned Parenthood was proposing to illegally sell tissue, prompting lawmakers in several states to launch investigations and Republicans in Congress to attempt cutting off more than $500 million in federal money. But Planned Parenthood maintains that its process is legal and limited to a handful of states.Confused about what’s going on? We’re here to help. Here’s our rundown of eight things we know — and don’t know — about fetal tissue donation and Planned Parenthood.1. It is illegal to sell fetal tissue. But donations are legal.The National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 allows a woman to consent to donating fetal tissue after an abortion. The federal law sets restrictions that prevent the woman from knowing or having a say in how the tissue is used, or profiting from it.Fetuses also can’t be aborted for the specific purpose of using tissue, especially to sell it. The option can’t be discussed with the woman until after she has decided to have an abortion.Researchers have used fetal tissue since the 1930s; experimentation on the tissue was instrumental in eventually developing the polio vaccine. Current studies are using the tissue to research diseases like AIDS, muscular dystrophy and Parkinson’s disease.2. The law allows for ""reasonable"" fees to cover the group’s costs of donating the tissue.Part of the video shows Deborah Nucatola, senior director of medical services at the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, telling undercover activists that tissues can be obtained for fees in the $30 to $100 range. Activists against abortion rights point to this as proof that Planned Parenthood is "" selling the body parts of aborted children .""But the 1993 law also makes allowances for ""reasonable payments associated with the transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, or storage of human fetal tissue.""The fees Nucatola discusses in the video likely fall under that definition, experts told PolitiFact.3. Nothing specifies how much appropriate fees should be.What counts as a ""reasonable payment"" is not explicitly outlined in the law. Organizations don’t have to publicly report how much they are charging buyers that process the tissue and isolate specific cells before selling them to researchers. Activists in the videos were posing as brokers and went back and forth with Nucatola to get her to disclose Planned Parenthood’s fees.""The amounts she cites do not appear to be out of the ordinary, but no one knows because there is no registry or compendium of fees charged by organizations (or) institutions supplying fetal tissue,"" said Arthur Caplan, director of the Division of Medical Ethics at New York University’s Langone Medical Center. ""When she haggles about fees, that does not appear to me to be trying to profit.""4. There are no regulations for what brokers charge researchers, either.While abortion clinics or hospitals sometimes provide tissue directly to researchers, organizations or private companies like the tissue brokers mentioned above often act as middlemen. Profiteering may be occurring on this level, Caplan said.Caplan said brokers can resell tissue to researchers at what seem like fairly high markups, but ""regulations don't exist on fees, so what they charge is set by market.""California-based StemExpress is one such broker and is cited in one of the Center for Medical Progress videos as contracting with Planned Parenthood for fetal tissue. The company charges fees for many kinds of human cells, from $100 for a vial of peripheral blood to $24,000 for a vial of highly concentrated fetal liver cells. The company reported $2.2 million in revenue in 2013, according to a profile in Inc. Magazine.Prue Talbot, the director of the Stem Cell Center at the University of California, Riverside, agreed with a StemExpress statement that said research methods and expensive medical equipment are expensive. Talbot said skilled technicians that can isolate and preserve specific kinds of cells also command high salaries, driving up costs.5. Political pressure is driving the issue in some states.Since the videos were released, at least 12 states, including Florida, Texas, Georgia and South Carolina, have called for investigations into the organization’s tissue program.States follow the federal law, but Wisconsin legislators have vowed to ban fetal tissue donation in the fall. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a presidential candidate, canceled his state’s contract with Planned Parenthood even though the two facilities in that state don’t offer abortion services.""It is against the law for any organization to sell body parts,"" Florida Gov. Rick Scott said on July 29 . ""If a Planned Parenthood office is not following the law, we will move quickly to take legal and regulatory action against them.""Florida's health services agency announced Aug. 5 that three facilities would be cited for performing second-trimester abortions without a proper license and a fourth will be cited for improper recordkeeping following its investigation.6. Planned Parenthood says it only has donation programs in a few states. But we don’t know which ones.Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards has said her organization conducts tissue donations in ""less than five"" states.But no one — not from Planned Parenthood, its state affiliates or companies that procure the stem cells — will disclose the states where this happens.A spokeswoman for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the organization’s national wing, cited security concerns. So far, affiliates in Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire , Indiana and Florida have denied having any form of a tissue donation program.7. Federal law does not require Planned Parenthood to disclose this information on their tax forms.You may think that because Planned Parenthood receives federal money, it has to disclose more information about its business, including the fetal tissue donation locations.But that’s not the case.Planned Parenthood is a network of affiliated organizations that cooperate with each other, led by the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. As a registered 501(c)(4) nonprofit, each affiliate only has to release a yearly tax report called a Form 990. On the 990, those affiliates have to list their five largest contractors, but don’t have to provide any other details about their operations.8. Abortions do not make up the majority of Planned Parenthood’s services. But neither do mammograms.The tissue donation controversy has reignited the country’s abortion wars, with advocates and critics alike slinging statistics about what Planned Parenthood really does.In a recent interview with GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, Fox Business reporter Smith said ""almost 95 percent of all their pregnancy services were abortions.""That rates False . The cherry-picked statistic traces back to a political action committee that opposes abortion. By the group’s measure, which considered only Planned Parenthood’s reported abortions, prenatal care services and adoption referrals, abortions made up 94 percent of Planned Parenthood’s ""pregnancy services."" But the majority of Planned Parenthood’s work does not focus on prenatal care, and the group does not keep records on how many pregnant women it refers to outside health care providers.Democratic presidential candidate and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley went the opposite direction, telling reporters ""97 percent of the work that Planned Parenthood does is about mammograms and preventative health.""That rates Half True. The 97 percent figure accounts for services other than abortion, including contraception, STD testing and treatment, cancer screenings, and more. Preventive care comprises about 85 to 90 percent of all their services. Mammograms are part of that group, but Planned Parenthood doesn’t offer mammograms. They perform breast exams and give referrals to outside clinics that provide mammograms.Editor's note: Hours after this story was published, Florida announced the results of its investigation into Planned Parenthood. The piece has been updated.AdvertisementResearchers: Anna Bruzgulis , Will Cabaniss , Lauren Carroll , Joshua GillinSources:"	1.0

Peter DeFazio and Earl Blumenauer are ""socialists who are openly serving in the U.S. Congress.""— Bloggers on Friday, August 12th, 2011 in web pagesBloggers claim Peter DeFazio and Earl Blumenauer are socialistsBy Charles Pope on Monday, August 29th, 2011 at 5:03 p.m.Bloggers are spreading a list of so-called socialists in Congress.Democratic Rep. Peter DeFazio has been called a lot of things over his 12 terms in Congress -- hot head, visionary, renegade, principled, effective and determined.Now, if a burst of activity on websites and blogs in recent weeks is to be believed, DeFazio is something else -- a socialist.And he’s not alone. The posts, all of which piggyback from a single offering that has been replicated on dozens of websites in recent weeks, says there are 70 card-carrying Socialists in the House of Representatives, including Rep. Earl Blumenauer, another Democrat from Oregon. (The number actually varies. Some posts say 70 while others insist it’s either 73 or 76. One post used both 76 and 75 in the same entry.)An Aug. 12 post on the website for a group called Sovereign Citizens United mentions DeFazio and Blumenauer by name. It also says this: ""I’m sure if you asked random people on the street if we had open socialists in the US Congress, they would say – well only Bernie Sanders (Senate). But the right answer is much, much worse.""""This should come as a surprise to absolutely no one,"" says an Aug. 16 post on ConservativeByte.com . ""The radical Marxist-progressives (communists) took control of the Democrat party some time ago. They’ve only become more emboldened with the election of Barack Obama, who was raised as a communist from birth."" In case you miss the point, the post comes equipped with a large and very bright hammer and sickle emblem.While most of the names politicians are called are opinions, calling a congressman a Socialist sounds both emphatic and exact, which always gets our attention here at PolitiFact Oregon.Another thing that gets our attention is when a claim gets spread far and wide. This one meets that test, too.Here’s a blog post on Aug. 17 by Texas radio host Dan Cofall, whose show airs out of Fort Worth:""The magic number ‘70’ is the number of members of the 111th Congress who are members of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). These are not just politicians who vote left of center; these are card-carrying members of ‘The Democratic Socialists of America’.""Cofall did not respond to an email asking for comment. And we couldn’t reach anyone from ConservativeByte.Before we get to our ruling, let’s begin with some basics. Congress resets itself every two years, which means the current edition is the 112th Congress, not the 111th. Why does that matter? Because the new Congress that begins in January every two years always follows an election and some of the people on the list are no longer in office.Cofall acknowledges this but then continues to list names from the 111th Congress anyway. Those listed as ""card carrying"" socialists who are no longer serving include: Robert Wexler (Florida), Phil Hare (Illinois), John Hall (New York), Alan Grayson (Florida), and Neil Abercrombie (Hawaii).Then there’s this: Real card-carrying Socialists say those members, including DeFazio and Blumenauer, aren’t Socialists.The list that Cofall and dozens more rely upon ""is completely fraudulent,"" said Frank Llewellyn, who served as national director of the Democratic Socialists of America for 10 years until stepping down July 5.There is not one member of Congress who is a formal member of the DSA, Llewellyn said. In order to join, a person must fill out a form and pay dues. Even Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, is not a formal member of the DSA, Llewellyn said.The last member of Congress who was an actual card-carrying member, he said, was California Democratic Rep. Ron Dellums, who served 28 years in the House until leaving in 1998.Llewellyn and DSA’s new national director, Maria Svart are chagrined for two reasons. First, they have to spend time knocking down reports that never seem to go away.Second, Llewellyn said, ""if we had formal political relationships with 70-odd members, we would be making a lot more money’’ from dues.For the record, both DeFazio and Blumenauer say they’ve never been associated with the Democratic Socialists of America.""This is another made-up Internet rumor that has no merit,"" DeFazio said.""I am a proud Democrat who has taken many independent stands over the years. I am anti-so called free trade, pro-American jobs, pro-infrastructure investment, pro-fair taxation, anti-amnesty, pro-balanced budget amendment, pro-Wall Street re-regulation, and pro-audit the Pentagon and Federal Reserve. I am an Oregonian and an independent thinker.""Blumenauer was equally annoyed.""No matter which side of the political aisle it comes from, this kind of name calling and rhetoric represents exactly what is wrong with our democracy today,"" he said. ""Rather than bringing people together to solve our nation's problems, it spreads false and divisive allegations throughout the media and the public. It is a major distraction from the real work that needs to get done.""Bad information gets spread all the time. But where did the number, or numbers, come from?The list purported to have originated with the DSA says this on page two:Q: How many members of the U.S. Congress are also members of the DSA?A: SeventyIt then lists them by name. What it does not say is that the names are simply lifted en masse from the membership of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, a collection of liberal-leaning lawmakers that includes DeFazio and Blumenauer but officially, not a single socialist.According to its website, the Progressive Caucus is one of the largest in Congress and works for such causes as economic justice, civil rights and civil liberties as well as global peace and security. Llewellyn said that DSA supports some of the policy positions of the caucus.Voicing support for positions embraced by a group of lawmakers is a routine part of business on Capitol Hill and is employed by organizations as disparate as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Rifle Association and NORML, a group devoted to legalizing the use of marijuana. But agreeing with some positions doesn’t make a member of Congress a card-carrying Socialist.Llewellyn says similar accusations of Socialism (with a capital S) have surfaced every election year since 1991 when the Progressive Caucus was created.""There’s nothing we can do to stop it, Llewellyn said. ""I can’t tell you the number of times we’ve tried to stop it.""Misinformation and smear campaigns also are part of political life. But these persistent claims about socialists are riddled with errors and outright lies. Any one of the problems would be sufficient to discredit the report, but taken together, the effort is flagrantly false. For that reason, we rate this claim: Pants on Fire."	1.0

Hillary Clinton's ""the only one who’s done it."" — Charles Schumer on Sunday, March 8th, 2015 in comments on CBS' ""Face the Nation""Fact-checking Chuck Schumer's defense of Hillary Clinton's private emailBy Steve Contorno on Sunday, March 8th, 2015 at 6:13 p.m.Hillary Clinton continues to face criticism for using a private email during her time as Secretary of State.Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton didn’t appear on the Sunday political talk shows to explain her use of a private email account to conduct State Department business. But Democrats were out in force to defend her as proxies.For example, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., appeared March 8 on CBS’ Face the Nation to throw cold water on accusations of wrongdoing on the part of Clinton.""The State Department asked all secretaries of state to send their emails over, and she’s the only one who’s done it,"" Schumer said.We decided to dig into Schumer’s claim. Spokesman Matt House said Schumer was referring to an October 2014 letter from the State Department to former secretaries of states.The letter has not been publicly published but its contents were outlined by State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf to the media last week. Harf said the letter was part of a routine effort to update record preservation and asked former secretaries to turn over emails containing state work conducted on personal accounts.A couple months after the request, Clinton turned over 55,000 pages of emails and documents from a personal email account created on a self-operated server, according to the New York Times and the State Department. Clinton has since requested ( via Twitter ) for those emails to be released.It’s not as though the letter went out to living secretaries of state dating back to Henry Kissinger. While it may be hard to remember a time before email, only four former secretaries have held the job during the prominence of electronic communications: Clinton, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright.As it is, the State Department query was limited to just those four individuals.Two of those individuals haven’t provided personal emails for good reason: They didn’t use email much during their time at the State Department. According to MSNBC , an aide for Albright said she ""did not use email while she was in office"" from 1997 to 2001.Similarly, Rice, head of the State Department from 2005 to 2009, was not a habitual emailer either, according to multiple reports. As Harf noted in a State Department briefing , ""Secretary Rice has repeatedly said that she did not regularly use email,"" and a spokesperson for Rice told ABC , ""She did not use personal email for official communication as secretary.""Essentially, two of the four former officials contacted didn’t turn any emails over because they didn’t have any to turn over. That’s pretty important context.And what about Powell, who served as Secretary of State during President George W. Bush’s first term? Powell appeared on ABC’s This Week to answers those questions.Apparently, Powell can’t turn over any documents. Why? Because he doesn’t have them anymore.""I retained none of those e-mails and we are working with the State Department to see if there's anything else they want to discuss with me about those emails,"" he said.""I did not keep a cache of them. I did not print them off,"" he added. ""I do not have thousands of pages somewhere in my personal files.""Harf acknowledged in a March 4 briefing that Powell's ""account has been closed for a number of years,"" and said, ""He’s looking to see if there’s anything responsive he still has.""You can draw your own conclusions about Powell not saving official emails from a 10-year-old account, and the relevance of that revelation to the Clinton controversy. Powell said most of his important correspondence would have been archived already, since they were sent to staff who had State Department accounts.But it does shed light on why Powell didn’t provide emails to the State Department, and it also demonstrates that he has taken steps to comply with the request, even if only recently.So to recap: The State Department reached out to four former secretaries asking about personal email accounts. Two have said they rarely used email, the third used personal email but had no records to turn over and the fourth was Clinton.That makes Schumer’s defense fairly hollow when you think about it.Clinton may have been the ""only"" person to provide emails, but realistically, that’s from a potential pool of two people.We took all this back to Schumer’s spokesman House. He stood by the comment.""There is another person (Powell) who specifically said he had emailed in a way that would be relevant to their request, but did not keep records so wouldn't be able to comply,"" House said. ""So she's the only one to do what State is asking.""Our rulingSchumer said, ""The State Department asked all secretaries of state to send their emails over, and (Clinton is) the only one who’s done it.""That statement is much more grandiose than the reality of the situation. The State Department asked four former secretaries of state for any official business conducted on personal emails. Two of those individuals, Albright and Rice, rarely used email at all while in office, let alone on a personal account. The other, Powell, has said his personal emails no longer exist, but said he is working with the State Department to recover them, if possible.The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.Correction: Clinton turned over 55,000 pages and documents from her private email account. A previous version of this fact-check described the number incorrectly.Advertisement"	1.0

""It's extremely significant for a lot of the people in my district and she made sure it happened.""Wilson is hoping to have a conversation with the likely new Speaker, John Boehner. At issue: whether or not the longtime lawmaker can wear her signature hats on the House floor. The House bars members from wearing hats while the body is in session, but Wilson said she believes the speaker can waive the rule -- which dates to the 1800s.""It's sexist,"" Wilson said. ""It dates back to when men wore hats and we know that men don't wear hats indoors, but women wear hats indoors. Hats are what I wear. People get excited when they see the hats.

Gardner Selby on Wednesday, July 23rd, 2014 at 4:58 p.m.Texas Gov. Rick Perry expressed concern about border-crossing immigrants committing crimes, going on to tell Glenn Beck in a July 17, 2014, interview ""the number of illegal activities up to and including homicides--I think over 3,000 homicides by illegal aliens over the course of the last six years; that’s unacceptable and that’s the reason that we have to secure that border.""That sounded like a lot of killings by unauthorized residents. (Where were those headlines?)Perry's backupWe decided to put Perry's number to the Texas Truth-O-Meter, starting with Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed, who told us to consult the Texas Department of Public Safety.DPS Director Steve McCraw referred to that many homicides in his July 3, 2014, testimony to the U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security. After saying the ""consequences of an unsecured border with Mexico"" undermine public safety, McCraw said: ""Another consequence seldom discussed is the high number of criminal aliens arrested for non-immigration crimes throughout Texas."" He then mentioned ""over 3,000 homicides"" since 2008.Asked for elaboration, a DPS spokesman, Tom Vinger, pointed to an agency web page, "" Texas Criminal Alien Arrest Data,"" stating that since January 2012, a monthly average of 5,899 ""foreign nationals"" -- individuals legally authorized to live in the U.S. or not -- have been arrested in Texas, with 40 percent having been arrested before on a criminal charge.Also on the page: ""From October 2008 through July 1, 2014, Texas has identified a total of 203,685 unique criminal alien defendants booked into Texas county jails. Over their criminal careers, these defendants are responsible for at least 642,564 individual criminal charges mostly consisting of Class B misdemeanors or higher, including 3,070 homicides and 7,964 sexual assaults,"" the agency says.The web page includes a pie chart tallying the criminal charges accumulated by the defendants:Source: Web page, "" Texas Criminal Alien Arrest Data,"" Texas Department of Public Safety (accessed July 21, 2014)The last line on the page says ""these are minimum figures as these numbers include only those aliens whose fingerprints were already in the federal system when they were booked and it does not necessarily include all those who are incarcerated in federal prison.""We asked Vinger for more detail about the homicide charges. We especially wondered how many charges had been leveled since the flow of children crossing the border started to escalate in 2011.Vinger replied by email, ""We don’t have any additional information.""Outside criminologistsNext, we explored whether Perry accurately cited the DPS information.To rehash, the governor told Beck more than 3,000 homicides had been committed by ""illegal aliens"" since 2008. However, the DPS web page doesn’t say that; it doesn’t even specify when (or where) the 3,070 homicide charges in the criminal histories of all the ""alien"" individuals arrested in Texas since October 2008 accumulated.Via the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, we reached criminologists who looked over the DPS presentation.Michael Walker, an adjunct John Jay professor and an expert in how the FBI gathers crime statistics, said the DPS information doesn’t demonstrate the 3,000-plus homicides were committed by any residents since 2008. Rather, Walker said by phone, the presentation telescoped the arrest histories of the 203,685 individuals put in county jails in the 69 months that were reviewed. ""Where did they offend--Texas? Oklahoma? Mississippi?"" Walker said, his point being such information isn’t on the web page.Walker and Ramiro Martinez, Jr., a Northeastern University professor, each suggested it’s highly unlikely unauthorized residents committed that many homicides in the years mentioned by Perry.Drawing on FBI Uniform Crime Statistics for Texas posted online by the DPS, Walker calculated that from 2008 through 2012, there were 3,903 persons arrested on homicide charges in the state. Walker said it’s not logical that residents in the state without legal permission accounted for most of the same deaths. He conceded, too, he wasn’t able to roll in homicide charges from 2013 and 2014; he didn’t see that data online nor were we successful in eliciting figures from DPS.Martinez offered up his own analysis, which started by averaging the FBI’s tally of a little more than 1,100 homicides in Texas in 2011 and 2012 and extrapolating that over six years to reach an estimated total of nearly 6,700 homicides over most of the period analyzed by DPS. By email, Martinez said Perry’s statement to Beck potentially would suggest 3,070, or 46 percent, of the estimated homicides were committed by ""illegal aliens."" But, he said, ""that makes no sense."" He said in a follow-up email: ""It just boggles the imagination that level of ‘aliens’ were involved to that extent over time and nobody noticed.""The criminologists noted another weakness; the DPS presentation mixes together recent homicide charges with those that might have been leveled decades ago. Also, they noted, the agency tallied arrests only, not homicide convictions.Martinez also raised an eyebrow at the mingling of criminal charges against legally authorized U.S. residents and individuals in the country without permission, risking conclusions irrelevant to border security today. By the state's approach, he said, it’s possible a homicide charge in the tally involves someone who reached the U.S. from Cuba in 1962 who was later charged with and/or committed a homicide. If so, he said, that charge would bear no relevance to criminal actions by people lately crossing the Rio Grande.Neither the DPS or Perry’s office offered more information.Our rulingPerry told Beck over 3,000 homicides were committed ""by illegal aliens over the"" last six years.This claim is unsupported by the presentation he relied on, which indicates that since 2008 in Texas, more than 200,000 arrested immigrants -- foreign nationals living here with or without legal permission -- had among them accumulated 3,070 homicide charges (not convictions) in their lives. Put another way, for this declaration to hold water, one would have to assume illegal immigrants committed nearly half of the state’s homicides since 2008; we found no such data.This statement is both incorrect and ridiculous.

Highlighted excerpts are below, and a full transcript is after the jump. LEW: You know, I have to tell you, as somebody who’s done budgets for a lot of years, usually when people say to me that something doesn’t cost money, I ask them, how could that be? This is the exception to the rule. If you priced two insurance plans, one of them with contraception and other without, the plan without contraception costs more than the one with it. So this will not cost the insurance companies money. It will not put religious institutions in a position (ph) where they have to violate their principles. CROWLEY: Why won’t it? Why — why is that? … CROWLEY: As far as the White House is concerned, is this done? LEW: … put out a pretty solid plan. CROWLEY: So no more compromising? LEW: We’ve put out the plan that reflects where the president intended to go. CROWLEY: So that means there is room for compromising or is not? LEW: No. This is our plan. LEW: I believe it should get solved. And I know there are people working hard even this weekend trying to solve it. CROWLEY: What are you doing — I mean, as far as the administration is concerned, is it all right for the Egyptian government to be holding these Americans inside the country? LEW: Well, let’s be clear. The situation in Egypt is quite serious. We have made clear we’re having conversations — General Dempsey is there this weekend — that it’s important to resolve this country to country. But to compare this to the Iranian hostage crisis really does a disservice to those Americans in Iran who truly were held hostage. This is a situation that can be resolved. There’s time to resolve it. And our government is working very hard. CROWLEY: Are you close to getting them out of the country? LEW: I don’t want to speak to where things are going, but all efforts are being made. LEW: Unless Republicans are willing to work with Democrats in the Senate, Harry Reid is not going to be able to get a budget passed. And I think he was reflecting the reality that that could be a challenge. But let’s be clear. There’s time and the desire to work together. You know, we’ve put a lot of things out there, ranging from authority to reorganize the government so that we have a government that’s the 21st century, not the 19th and the 20th century, home financing proposals so that Americans, Republicans and Democrats alike, can refinance homes that are underwater. CROWLEY: What’s the economy going to look like in September? What will the unemployment rate be? LEW: You know, we’ve been very heartened by the economic news of the last two, three months…. I can’t predict that each month will be as good as the last few, but we’re certainly headed in the right direction. What we need to make sure is that we don’t do anything to get in the way. Washington needs to get its work done. That’s why the payroll tax needs to be extended on time without a lot of drama. It’s why we need to do our business in a way that doesn’t create the kind of uncertainty that did harm to the economy over the summer. THIS IS A RUSH FDCH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CROWLEY: Joining me here in Washington, White House chief of staff Jacob Lew. Thanks for joining us. LEW: Good to be with you this morning. CROWLEY: I want to start out with what has roiled certainly some in the Catholic community, I know has really set (ph) the White House off in trying to get things situated, and that is this idea that Catholic universities, Catholic hospitals should have to pay for contraception for its employees as part of the health care plan. The president comes back with a compromise and says, well, the health care insurance will contact the women in these facilities and offer contraceptive services, and the women can accept or not accept, and the health care — the health care provider, Aetna, whatever, will pay for it. Is that where we are right now? LEW: Well, let me actually tell you where we are, Candy. The president’s had a consistent position throughout this. He has two principles that are very important. One is that all women have a right to all forms of (inaudible) health care, including contraception. Secondly, in the greatest tradition of this country, we have to respect the religious liberties of people with very different views. I think where this policy has come out is that the initial announcement of the policy said it would take some time to work through the details. Because of the concern that arose, we speeded up the process. And on Friday, what the president announced was we think a very good resolution of the problem. It’s gotten the support of a wide range of organizations, from Catholic charities and the Catholic Health Association to Planned Parenthood. It respects both of these core principles, and we think it’s a good solution. CROWLEY: Well, let me — it did not win the support of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which put out a statement Friday and said today’s proposal, being the compromise proposal, continues to involve needless government intrusion in the internal governance of religious institutions and to threaten government coercion of religious people and groups to violate their most deeply held convictions. You’re an observant Jew, I know. Was there anything about this that made you think twice when it first went out? LEW: No, you know, I have to say that the solution that we came up with puts no religious institution in a position where it either has to pay for or facilitate the provision of benefits they find objectionable. If the issue is, should women have access to all forms of preventive care, including contraception? We believe the answer to that is yes. CROWLEY: Can you say, though, with a straight face that the insurance company is going to pick up the cost of this? LEW: You know, I have to tell you, as somebody who’s done budgets for a lot of years, usually when people say to me that something doesn’t cost money, I ask them, how could that be? This is the exception to the rule. If you priced two insurance plans, one of them with contraception and other without, the plan without contraception costs more than the one with it. So this will not cost the insurance companies money. It will not put religious institutions in a position (ph) where they have to violate their principles. CROWLEY: Why won’t it? Why — why is that? LEW: Because the total cost of care for persons is higher without than it is with contraception. CROWLEY: Then why isn’t — why don’t health insurance companies everywhere just offer free contraceptive services? LEW: I actually think there won’t be as much resistance to this from insurance companies as people might think because of what I just said. If you look to examples in other states where it’s worked (ph), it’s worked pretty much the way I’ve described. There is an issue here. The issue is, do women have a right to contraception? And we think the answer is yes. Should religious institutions have their sensibilities protected? The answer is yes. You know, I am a person of faith. I care deeply that we’re a country that respects faith and that respects people’s rights to have different views. This was a challenge to reconcile two important principles, and the president found a way to reconcile those. There are others who don’t have the same objective, and they have to speak for themselves. CROWLEY: As far as the White House is concerned, is this done? LEW: … put out a pretty solid plan. CROWLEY: So no more compromising? LEW: We’ve put out the plan that reflects where the president intended to go. CROWLEY: So that means there is room for compromising or is not? LEW: No. This is our plan. CROWLEY: OK. Let me move you on to the payroll tax cut. We’re coming up to the end of the month. How certain are you that Congress is going to pass a year-long extension of this payroll tax cut and the other things that come with it, the doc fix and unemployment insurance? LEW: You know, I think that it’s clear that the economy is doing much better, but it needs to have that additional push that comes from this payroll tax. We saw in December that it didn’t work out so well to have a big, ugly fight over the payroll tax. We can avoid that. We have enough time for Congress to get its work done. You know, we all care about having the economic growth and having unemployment go down and employment go up. This payroll tax is important. There are — this can be solved. Congress needs to gets its work done. LEW: I believe it should get solved. And I know there are people working hard even this weekend trying to solve it. CROWLEY: Let me show you a recent ABC News poll about the president’s handling of the federal budget deficit, and we will get to the budget, which we know is coming out tomorrow, in a bit. But I want to ask you in general. This poll shows that 38 percent of Americans approve of the way the president’s handling the deficit, and 58 percent disapprove. Why is that, do you think? LEW: You know, we’ve just come through one of the worst economic periods in modern history. When the president took office, we were losing jobs at a rate of 750,000 a month. We’re now at a point where we’re gaining jobs at a rate of 250,000 a month, so it’s a swing of a million jobs from when we took office to now. CROWLEY: (inaudible) deficits specifically. LEW: In order to get to the point where we are, it has required us to do things that you wouldn’t have done under other circumstances. So the Recovery Act that did involve some spending, having federal programs that automatically kick in. Revenues were down because economic growth was lower. We share the concerns of the American people that we need to focus on the deficit, and we’ll talk about the president’s budget, which does $4 trillion of deficit reduction in a fair, balanced way, that asks everybody to do their fair share. So we have a plan. But it’s not surprising to me that the American people are looking at the deficit today and saying they’d like some action now. LEW: Yeah, we — we agree with them. CROWLEY: Let me — before we get to that — and it’ll be after the break — let me ask you about Egypt. Newt Gingrich said in a recent speech that there are Americans being held hostage in America. We do know there are Americans are not being allowed to leave, because the Egyptian military government has said it may want to prosecute them. He compared it to the Iranian hostage crisis. What are you doing — I mean, as far as the administration is concerned, is it all right for the Egyptian government to be holding these Americans inside the country? LEW: Well, let’s be clear. The situation in Egypt is quite serious. We have made clear we’re having conversations — General Dempsey is there this weekend — that it’s important to resolve this country to country. But to compare this to the Iranian hostage crisis really does a disservice to those Americans in Iran who truly were held hostage. This is a situation that can be resolved. There’s time to resolve it. And our government is working very hard. CROWLEY: Are you close to getting them out of the country? LEW: I don’t want to speak to where things are going, but all efforts are being made. CROWLEY: OK. Coming up, more with White House chief of staff Jacob Lew. And later, Rick Santorum got a rousing reception at CPAC, but lost the conservative straw poll vote to Mitt Romney. We’ll ask him why. CROWLEY: We are back with White House chief of staff Jacob Lew. I want to put up for our viewers what we know about some of the things that are coming out of this — the president’s budget plan tomorrow, and that is $350 billion in short-term jobs spending, $476 billion in spending on infrastructure, $60 billion for schools and retaining teachers, first responders. We just got finished talking about the deficit, and we saw the low numbers of the approval numbers for the president on dealing with the federal deficit. This looks like another stimulus plan. LEW: Well, this is a budget that takes both a short- and a long-term view. I think that there’s broad agreement from all of the commissions that were out doing work on the budget to most budget experts that, over this next period of time, we still need to pay attention to sustaining economic growth and creating jobs. That’s why it’s so important to pass the payroll tax before the end of February. It’s why it’s so important that we jump-start our investment in infrastructure. LEW: This is a budget that takes a look at the short and the long term. Over the long term, there’s $4 trillion of deficit reduction in this budget. It comes by adhering to the rules that were part of the budget agreement last year, which was $1 trillion of savings in the annual appropriation. It has another $1 trillion of savings that were part of the August debt agreement. And then there’s $2 trillion of additional savings on top of that. This comes from very tough policies in almost every area, from mandatory programs to revenues. CROWLEY: It also comes from more spending, some of this funding. LEW: The savings come from the tough decisions. The savings come from having a policy that’s based on the principles that the president outlined in Kansas and that he outlined in the State of the Union. CROWLEY: What’s the toughest cut (ph) of the whole thing? CROWLEY: Do you think that sounds like a tough cut, you know consolidating agriculture departments? LEW: I think that when you look at $1 trillion of savings over 10 years, that’s a lot of money; $1 trillion doesn’t have to come by — you know, we have to make sure that as we make these reductions, we do it in a smart way. So we cut some things, and we increase other things. So, for example, while we’re cutting the things that we can do without, we’re increasing what we put in over this period of time into research and development, so we can build the economy of the future and make sure that we have an economy that can last. CROWLEY: Do you think it looks like a stimulus plan? LEW: I think most Americans understand that a crumbling infrastructure is not the way to build an economy that can last. You know, we need to make sure that we have a manufacturing base in this country. We need to make sure that we have American workers with the skills for the jobs of the future. We need to make sure that we have an energy policy that will leave us in a place where we can generate our own energy and also not be dependent on overseas (ph). And we also need to have a policy that’s true to American values, and that means that everyone has to pay their fair share and have a fair shot. CROWLEY: I know we’ll want to talk about the tax hikes in a second, but I want to read for our viewers something that Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader in the U.S. Senate, who said, we do not need to bring a budget to the floor this year. It’s done. We don’t need to do it, talking about last year’s two-year agreement and saying that, you know, so it’s already done. This budget, I can assure you and you know, because you’ve been in this town for a long time, is going to be attacked as a political document. This is a budget that promises 2 million more jobs if it’s passed, so that come September the president can go out there and say, well, if they’d only passed by budget, we’d have 2 million more jobs, but those darn Republicans are standing in my way, when, in fact, even the Democratic leader in the Senate says, you know what, we don’t need a budget. LEW: Well, let’s be clear. What Senator Reid is talking about is a fairly narrow point. In order for the Senate to do its annual work on appropriation bills, they need to pass a certain piece of legislation which sets a limit. They did that last year. That’s what he’s talking about. He’s not saying that they shouldn’t pass a budget. But we also need to be honest. You can’t pass a budget in the Senate of the United States without 60 votes, and you can’t get 60 votes without bipartisan support. LEW: Unless Republicans are willing to work with Democrats in the Senate, Harry Reid is not going to be able to get a budget passed. And I think he was reflecting the reality that that could be a challenge. But let’s be clear. There’s time and the desire to work together. You know, we’ve put a lot of things out there, ranging from authority to reorganize the government so that we have a government that’s the 21st century, not the 19th and the 20th century, home financing proposals so that Americans, Republicans and Democrats alike, can refinance homes that are underwater. There’s a lot that we can and should do together on a bipartisan basis this year (ph). CROWLEY: Last question. What’s the economy going to look like in September? What will the unemployment rate be? LEW: You know, we’ve been very heartened by the economic news of the last two, three months. CROWLEY: (inaudible) keep falling? LEW: … that unemployment has been falling. Job growth is strong. CROWLEY: Do you think it will continue to fall and be lower in September than it is now? LEW: I can’t predict that each month will be as good as the last few, but we’re certainly headed in the right direction. What we need to make sure is that we don’t do anything to get in the way. Washington needs to get its work done. That’s why the payroll tax needs to be extended on time without a lot of drama. It’s why we need to do our business in a way that doesn’t create the kind of uncertainty that did harm to the economy over the summer. CROWLEY: White House chief of staff Jacob Lew, thanks for joining us. LEW: Good to be with you, Candy.	1.0

Bruce Rauner and primary challenger, state Rep. Jeanne Ives, debate abortion legislation during a meeting with the Chicago Tribune Editorial Board at Tribune Tower on Jan. 29, 2018. (Roger Tino Morales and Kayli Plotner / Chicago Tribune)Editorial BoardRepublican Gov. Bruce Rauner would love to spend these gray winter days focused on his November re-election bid against a Democrat opponent, but he can’t. First, he’s got to win the Republican primary on March 20, in which he will face off against former ally state Rep. Jeanne Ives of Wheaton.On Monday, Rauner and Ives made a joint appearance before the Tribune Editorial Board at which they sparred over who has the better strategy for addressing Illinois’ political dysfunction and creating jobs. This is their only scheduled debate; you can view it at chicagotribune.com/gopgov .Whenever an incumbent gets a serious primary challenge, that says something — that there’s uncertainty among party faithful, or dissatisfaction. Such is the case for Rauner, the former private equity executive who defeated Gov. Pat Quinn in 2014 as the unconquerable outsider.Turns out Rauner hasn’t been able to bend House Speaker Michael Madigan and the Democratic-run General Assembly to his will. The governor’s “turnaround agenda” stalled. Residents are fleeing high-tax Illinois. Employers are bailing, too, or choosing instead to invest in other states. We’ve begun to think about this election in dire terms. The Land of Lincoln has a festering pension crisis and a reputation as a loser. Job growth is weak. A lot of voters think Illinois must change or die.Ives, a social conservative, edged into the race after Rauner signed legislation expanding taxpayer-subsidized abortion for women covered by Medicaid or state employee health insurance. But now that she’s in, she’s running hard as a critic of the governor’s economic policy chops and his relentless public feuding with Madigan. One of Illinois’ problems is that Madigan actively blocks the governor’s job growth efforts.Before the primary, we will endorse a Republican and a Democratic candidate for governor. Today we reach only the conclusion that Ives, now in her third term in the Illinois House, makes a persuasive case as an alternative to Rauner. Especially on the question of who might work with, or work around, Madigan and colleagues, Ives presented herself as a Republican legislator who knows how to work with Democrats in Springfield.We said at the top of this editorial that the governor is eager to run against a Democrat, not another Republican. He made clear Monday he thinks his greatest adversary is Madigan, whom the governor attacked for being a property tax attorney in a state where many property owners challenge their assessments. “We need to focus on Speaker Madigan and his corruption,” Rauner told us. He then connected dots from Madigan to J.B. Pritzker, one of the Democrats running for governor. “Pritzker is Madigan’s handpicked candidate for governor. He’s in effect Madigan’s bagman for funding that whole corrupt culture.”One comment about such incendiary talk: We don’t see how it convinces employers such as Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who values a stable culture of governance, to invest money and hire in Illinois.Rauner wishes Madigan would just disappear. Rauner’s second wish is that the U.S. Supreme Court rules in Illinois’ favor in two cases that could weaken the role of unions and thus make the state appear more friendly and flexible to employers. Indeed that’s possible, but it’s bad policy to bet the farm on the deliberation of judges. Yet Rauner, as if he were quoting James Earl Jones in “Field of Dreams,” sounds convinced of his own good luck.“You watch us boom” after the court victories, Rauner promised. “Even if Madigan is still in power, which I hope he’s not after November, we will get changes through the courts that will allow us to compete. And the companies will come from Indiana. They’ll come from Wisconsin and Texas and Tennessee. We will be a rapid growth state.” (Remember that fantasy sequence from “Field of Dreams”? “People will come, Ray. They'll come to Iowa for reasons they can't even fathom.”)As a challenger rising from Springfield’s backbenches, Ives has a debating advantage because she can make fresh promises uncompromised by past performance or daunting realities. But she made a good point about having a track record of working across the aisle. She made another good point about targeting smaller victories to prove to employers and investors that Illinois can be more business-friendly. Her example: Address pension reform by shifting new state employees to 401(k)-style retirement plans. “It would have sent a strong signal to the bond market, to the business community, and to residents that we’re finally serious about doing something about not digging the hole deeper,” she said.Monday’s conversation was one moment in the campaign. The candidates have more time to differentiate themselves. Another debate or two would help. Bruce Rauner, with a strong polling and millions in his coffers, showed no interest. But he should capitalize on the chance to sell Republicans on himself. Because in Jeanne Ives they’ve got a legitimate alternative.Join the discussion on Twitter @ Trib_Ed_Board and on Facebook .	1.0

So why am I not more excited by the Gingrich surge? In the first place, Gingrich loves government more than I do. He has no Hayekian modesty to restrain his faith in statist endeavor. I’m for national greatness conservatism, but this is a little too great. Furthermore, he has an unconservative faith in his own innocence. The crossroads where government meets enterprise can be an exciting crossroads. It can also be a corrupt crossroads. It requires moral rectitude to separate public service from private gain. Gingrich was perfectly content to belly up to the Freddie Mac trough and then invent a Hamiltonian rationale to justify his own greed. Then there is his rhetorical style. He seems to have understood that a moderate Republican like himself can win so long as he adopts a bombastic style when taking on the liberal elites. Most people just want somebody who can articulate their hatreds, and Gingrich is demagogically happy to play the role. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

An error has occurred. Please try again later. You are already subscribed to this email. Most important, there is temperament and character. But they have very different temperaments. Romney, Levin observes, has an executive temperament — organization, discipline, calm and restraint. Gingrich has a revolutionary temperament — intensity, energy, disorganization and a tendency to see everything as a cataclysmic clash requiring a radical response. I’d make a slightly similar point more rudely. In the two main Republican contenders, we have one man, Romney, who seems to have walked straight out of the 1950s, and another, Gingrich, who seems to have walked straight out of the 1960s. He has every negative character trait that conservatives associate with ’60s excess: narcissism, self-righteousness, self-indulgence and intemperance. He just has those traits in Republican form. As nearly everyone who has ever worked with him knows, he would severely damage conservatism and the Republican Party if nominated. He would severely damage the Hamilton-Theodore Roosevelt strain in American life. It’s really too bad. We could have had a great debate about the progressive-conservative tradition. President Obama is now embracing Roosevelt. Gingrich has tried to modernize this tendency. But how you believe something is as important as what you believe. It doesn’t matter if a person shares your overall philosophy. If that person doesn’t have the right temperament and character, stay away. A version of this op-ed appears in print on December 9, 2011, on Page A39 of the New York edition with the headline: The Gingrich Tragedy.	1.0

He told Politico that his resignation was not in any way related to scandal. Not in any way shape or form. Ive been given more enemas by more people over the last eight years than you can possibly imagine. From the Secret Service to the Democratic Party. I am who I am. If they had something really scandalous, it wouldve come out a long, long time ago.Well, it would be true that it would have come out a long, long time ago had the FBI been investigating Russian money laundering by people involved in the American political process. But until Donald Trump came along, there werent really any major questions about such things in our political process. But we will get into that in a bit.The real scandal here is that somebody wanted to sleep with Jason ChaffetzAnother revelation is that Jason Chaffetz wants to spend more time with his family because he is allegedly having an affair.Latest from a well placed Congressional source is that @jasoninthehouse multi year affair with a woman was about to be revealed. https://t.co/Dg4hKCRtbZ Claude Taylor (@TrueFactsStated) April 20, 2017Just in case you arent familiar with Claude Taylor, he is a veteran of three presidential campaigns and was a White House staffer for the Clinton administration. He also served in the Obama administration. And this is just one piece of possible Russian kompromat on Jason Chaffetz.A 2nd source is claiming that the Russians knew about Chaffetz's affair and were blackmailing him. https://t.co/Dg4hKCzRNp Claude Taylor (@TrueFactsStated) April 20, 2017Chaffetz and Comeys leaked letterChaffetz is also the person responsible for leaking James Comeys letter to the public over the Clinton e-mail scandal. The press continually blamed Comey but the real culprit that used that information to interfere in the election was none other than Jason Chaffetz. This garnered Chaffetz a big fat ethics complaint from Scott Dworkin of the Democratic Coalition.According to a statement from Dworkin: Representative Chaffetz, in an ill-planned partisan attempt, released information that compromised the integrity of the FBI, when he irresponsibly tweeted out that the case investigating Secretary Clintons emails had been reopened, when in fact, it had not been. Members of Congress are elected to make our country a safer, better place  not to use their power to work with leaders such as Comey in a partisan fashion. I hope that both are held accountable for their actions.Some reports also allege that Chaffetz received a check from Trump for a whopping $10 million bucks for leaking the letter. Money that was likely obtained through nefarious means. Russian money laundering, anyone?Chaffetz and Russian Money LaunderingAnother scandal comes amid allegations that Chaffetz along with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell were working on ways to get Russian money into the American political process via dark super PACs that would hide the origin of the money received.According to an article from The Daily Kos:...The laundering of Russian money does make a great deal of sense. Why? Because just a few days ago there was a lot of chatter about an audio tape the FBI took into evidence. This pre-election tape purports to be a recording of Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell discussing how best to wash Russian money through House and senate campaigns via dark money superPACs. Paul Ryans name has already been linked with the Russian hacking of voter data from swing states so money laundering on behalf of the Russians is not a big leap from there and would be entirely in character for both men. Certainly both were desperate to hold onto the power they knew was slipping through their fingers so both would have grabbed at any opportunity for big money assistance without caring much where it came from.That would also explain Chaffetzs desires to gut the Office of Congressional Ethics. After all, with the complaints filed and a looming FBI investigation, that particular office could prove to be quite the thorn in the side of Republicans looking to cover up the crimes of the Trump campaign.According to a report from The Failing New York Times:House Republicans, overriding their top leaders, voted on Monday to significantly curtail the power of an independent ethics office set up in 2008 in the aftermath of corruption scandals that sent three members of Congress to jail.The move to effectively kill the Office of Congressional Ethics was not made public until late Monday, when Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, announced that the House Republican Conference had approved the change. There was no advance notice or debate on the measure.Of course, they failed to gut the OCE due to public outcry but Republicans may still win the day when a new budget passes.So actually, yeah Jason, youre resigning because of a massive scandal. Just not one massive scandal. Unless, of course, Chaffetz doesnt think Russian money laundering is a scandal. We look forward to seeing him do the perp walk with his cohorts in the House and Senate.

Domestic assets are moving into defensive positions. POSSIBLY RELATED MATERIAL (UPDATES CONTINUE BELOW FOLLOWING THIS RELATED MATERIAL)American and Russian fighter jets had a tense showdown in the skies above Syria as the Russians dropped bombs on U.S.-backed rebels.U.S. and Russian fighter jets bloodlessly tangled in the air over Syria on June 16 as the American pilots tried and failed to stop the Russians from bombing U.S.-backed rebels in southern Syria near the border with Jordan.The aerial close encounter underscores just how chaotic Syria’s skies have become as Russia and the U.S.-led coalition work at cross-purposes, each dropping bombs in support of separate factions in the five-year-old civil war.The near-clash also highlights the escalating risk of American and Russian forces actually coming to blows over Syria, potentially sparking a much wider conflict between the world’s leading nuclear powers.The incident began when at least two twin-engine Su-34 bombers, some of Moscow’s most advanced warplanes, struck what the Pentagon described as a “border garrison”  housing around 200 U.S.-supported rebels in At Tanf on the Syrian side of the Syria-Jordan border.The rebels had been “conducting counter-ISIL operations in the area,” the Pentagon stated on June 18, using an alternative acronym for ISIS.The United States and its allies in Syria clearly did not expect the air strike. The rebels in At Tanf are party to a shaky ceasefire agreement between rebel forces and the regime of Syrian president Bashar Al Assad—and, by extension, the Russian military contingent backing Al Assad. The Los Angeles Times reported that Russian planes had not previously been active over At Tanf. The Su-34s’ initial strike wounded, and perhaps killed, some of the rebels in At Tanf.The U.S. Navy scrambled F/A-18 fighters to intercept the Russians, the Los Angeles Times reported. The Navy has deployed two aircraft carriers to the region for strikes on ISIS. As the F/A-18s approached the Su-34s, officials with U.S. Central Command—which oversees America’s wars in the Middle East and Afghanistan—used a special hotline to contact their Russian counterparts directing Russia’s own intervention in Syria.Arriving over At Tanf, the American pilots apparently spoke directly to the Russian aviators. “Pilots CAN communicate with one another on a communications channel set up to avoid air accidents,” Central Command confirmed in a statement to The Daily Beast.Washington and Moscow had established the hotline as part of a so-called “Safety of Flight Memorandum of Understanding” that the two governments signed in October specifically in order to avoid the kind of aerial confrontation that occurred over Syria last week.With the American jets flying close enough to visually identify the Su-34s, the Russians departed the air space over At Tanf. Some time shortly thereafter, the F/A-18s ran low on fuel and left the area in order to link up with an aerial tanker. That’s when the Su-34s reportedly returned to At Tanf —and bombed the rebels again.According to the Los Angeles Times, the second strike killed first-responders assisting survivors of the first bombing run.The next day, senior U.S. Defense Department officials organized an “extraordinary” video conference with Russian counterparts to discuss the incident. The meeting included Acting Assistant Secretary for International Security Affairs Elissa Slotkin and U.S. Marine Corps Lt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, a strategic planner on the Pentagon’s joint staff, plus unspecified Russian Ministry of Defense officials.“Department officials expressed strong concerns about the attack on the coalition-supported counter-ISIL forces at the At Tanf garrison, which included forces that are participants in the cessation of hostilities in Syria, and emphasized that those concerns would be addressed through ongoing diplomatic discussions on the cessation of hostilities,” Defense Department spokesman Peter Cook explained in a statement.""Regarding safety, department officials conveyed that Russia’s continued strikes at At Tanf, even after U.S. attempts to inform Russian forces through proper channels of on-going coalition air support to the counter-ISIL forces, created safety concerns for U.S. and coalition forces,” Cook continued. “Department officials requested Russian responses to address those concerns.”Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov confirmed, via the country’s state-owned media, that the teleconference took place—but he did not specify the results of the “extraordinary” meeting.Russian warplanes had previously shadowed planes belonging to the U.S.-led coalition over Syria, but the coalition always described the Russians’ behavior as “professional.” By contrast, in April Russian Su-24 bombers repeatedly buzzed the U.S. Navy warship USS Donald Cook while the vessel sailed in international waters in the Black Sea. A Pentagon spokesman called the Russians’ actions in that incident “provocative and unprofessional.”The Kremlin should be keenly aware of the potential for unwanted—and potentially destabilizing—bloodshed that exists in the air over Syria. In November, a Russian Su-24 bomber flying a mission over Syria strayed over the Syria-Turkey border into Turkey—and a Turkish F-16 fighter promptly shot it down .The two Russian crew members ejected. One flier died when Syrian rebels on the ground opened fire on his parachute. Russian, Syrian and Iranian forces launched a complex rescue mission that ultimately retrieved the surviving pilot. One Russian marine died and a helicopter was destroyed during that operation.The fallout from the November incident continues, with Russia and Turkey exchanging threats—and Moscow imposing economic sanctions on Ankarra including limits on some food imports to Russia from Turkey.It’s not clear how close the U.S. fighters came to attacking and potentially shooting down the Su-34s over At Tanf. Central Command declined to say what the rules of engagement are for American pilots flying over Syria. “ROE are actually specifics that we don’t get into,” Central Command said in a statement.The last time a U.S. military warplane shot down a Russian—actually, Soviet—plane was in 1953, over Korea or China, depending on which historians you believe. The last time a Russian or Soviet warplane shot down an American aircraft was in 1970, when a U.S. Army plane strayed over Armenia.#### RESUMING UPDATES . . . .At 4:32 AM EDT -- A huge explosion has struck an ammunition depot at a military firing range in southern Russia. The Defense Ministry said around 600 people have been evacuated.The incident took place at Ashuluk testing range near the city of Astrakhan in southern Russia. As of 6:23 EDT this morning Currently NATO has an abnormal ammount of fighters and c-130s up over europe.x10 F-16"	1.0

After more than two decades following a “no testing on animals” policy, cosmetics giants Avon, Mary Kay, and Estee Lauder have resumed the practice without letting consumers know. In the late 1980s, PETA’s “Avon Killing” campaign eventually led to the company banning animal testing for their products, with Mary Kay and Estée Lauder following suit.According to a press release from Rush PR, the news was broken after animal rights organization PETA removed the companies from their cruelty-free list after discovering that they had returned to using testing on animals for their products. The three companies began the tests again in order to satisfy regulations from the Chinese government so they could sell their products in China. However, PETA contends that there are alternative testing methods that are just as effective and widely used in the US.Kathy Guillermo, the Vice President of PETA’s Laboratory Investigations was saddened by the move: “Avon, Estée Lauder, and Mary Kay have regressed a generation: Their products are once again being dripped into rabbits’ eyes and smeared onto animals’ abraded skin.” She’s urging customers to choose cruelty-free products instead.Avon spokeswoman Reese Witherspoon may be upset to learn about the new animal testing as well. Late last year she was “dismayed” to learn a bag she was spotted with was made from real python skin and agreed to throw it away. But perhaps she can use her star power to influence Avon to go back to their animal-friendly ways.Keep You Up To Date On All Our Doggie News!Join our mailing list to receive the latest news and updates from Dog Files.SUBMIT!Thank you so much for subscribing to Dog Files!Share:	1.0

It goes far and beyond organic versus nonorganic, gluten or hybridization because even conventional wheat triggers no symptoms for some who eat wheat in other parts of the world.What indeed is going on with wheat?For quite some time, I secretly harbored the notion that wheat in the United States must, in fact, be genetically modified.  GMO wheat secretly invading the North American food supply seemed the only thing that made sense and could account for the varied experiences I was hearing about.I reasoned that it couldn’t be the gluten or wheat hybridization. Gluten and wheat hybrids have been consumed for thousands of years. It just didn’t make sense that this could be the reason for so many people suddenly having problems with wheat and gluten in general in the past 5-10 years.Finally, the answer came over dinner a couple of months ago with a friend who was well versed in the wheat production process. I started researching the issue for myself, and was, quite frankly, horrified at what I discovered.The good news is that the reason wheat has become so toxic in the United States is not because it is secretly GMO as I had feared (thank goodness!).The bad news is that the problem lies with the manner in which wheat is grown and harvested by conventional wheat farmers.You’re going to want to sit down for this one.  I’ve had some folks burst into tears in horror when I passed along this information before.Common wheat harvest protocol in the United States is to drench the wheat fields with Roundup several days before the combine harvesters work through the fields as the practice allows for an earlier, easier and bigger harvest.Pre-harvest application of the herbicide Roundup or other herbicides containing the deadly active ingredient glyphosate to wheat and barley as a desiccant was suggested as early as 1980.  It has since become routine over the past 15 years and is used as a drying agent 7-10 days before harvest within the conventional farming community.According to Dr. Stephanie Seneff of MIT who has studied the issue in depth and who I recently saw present on the subject at a nutritional Conference in Indianapolis, desiccating non-organic wheat crops with glyphosate just before harvest came into vogue late in the 1990’s with the result that most of the non-organic wheat in the United States is now contaminated with it.  Seneff explains that when you expose wheat to a toxic chemical like glyphosate, it actually releases more seeds resulting in a slightly greater yield:   “It ‘goes to seed’ as it dies. At its last gasp, it releases the seed” says Dr. Seneff.According to the US Department of Agriculture, as of 2012, 99% of durum wheat, 97% of spring wheat, and 61% of winter wheat has been treated with herbicides. This is an increase from 88% for durum wheat, 91% for spring wheat and 47% for winter wheat since 1998.Here’s what wheat farmer Keith Lewis has to say about the practice:I have been a wheat farmer for 50 yrs and one wheat production practice that is very common is applying the herbicide Roundup (glyposate) just prior to harvest. Roundup is licensed for preharvest weed control. Monsanto, the manufacturer of Roundup claims that application to plants at over 30% kernel moisture result in roundup uptake by the plant into the kernels. Farmers like this practice because Roundup kills the wheat plant allowing an earlier harvest.A wheat field often ripens unevenly, thus applying Roundup preharvest evens up the greener parts of the field with the more mature. The result is on the less mature areas Roundup is translocated into the kernels and eventually harvested as such.This practice is not licensed. Farmers mistakenly call it “desiccation.” Consumers eating products made from wheat flour are undoubtedly consuming minute amounts of Roundup. An interesting aside, malt barley which is made into beer is not acceptable in the marketplace if it has been sprayed with preharvest Roundup. Lentils and peas are not accepted in the market place if it was sprayed with preharvest roundup….. but wheat is ok.. This farming practice greatly concerns me and it should further concern consumers of wheat products.Here’s what wheat farmer Seth Woodland of Woodland and Wheat in Idaho had to say about the practice of using herbicides for wheat dry down:That practice is bad . I have fellow farmers around me that do it and it is sad. Lucky for you not all of us farm that way. Being the farmer and also the president of a business, we are proud to say that we do not use round up on our wheat ever!This practice is not just widespread in the United States either. The Food Standards Agency in the United Kingdom reports that use of Roundup as a wheat desiccant results in glyphosate residues regularly showing up in bread samples. Other European countries are waking up to to the danger, however. In the Netherlands, use of Roundup is completely banned with France likely soon to follow.Using Roundup on wheat crops throughout the entire growing season and even as a desiccant just prior to harvest may save the farmer money and increase profits, but it is devastating to the health of the consumer who ultimately consumes the glyphosate residue laden wheat kernels.The chart below of skyrocketing applications of glyphosate to US wheat crops since 1990 and the incidence of celiac disease is from a December 2013 study published in the Journal Interdisciplinary Toxicology examining glyphosate pathways to autoimmune disease. Remember that wheat is not currently GMO or “Roundup Ready” meaning it is not resistant to its withering effects like GMO corn or GMO soy, so application of glyphosate to wheat would actually kill it.While the herbicide industry maintains that glyphosate is minimally toxic to humans,  research published in the Journal Entropy  strongly argues otherwise by shedding light on exactly how glyphosate disrupts mammalian physiology.Authored by Anthony Samsel and Stephanie Seneff of MIT, the paper investigates glyphosate’s inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, an overlooked component of lethal toxicity to mammals.The currently accepted view is that ghyphosate is not harmful to humans or any mammals.  This flawed view is so pervasive in the conventional farming community that Roundup salesmen have been known to foolishly drink it during presentations!However, just because Roundup doesn’t kill you immediately doesn’t make it nontoxic.  In fact, the active ingredient in Roundup lethally disrupts the all important shikimate pathway found in beneficial gut microbes which is responsible for synthesis of critical amino acids.Friendly gut bacteria, also called probiotics, play a critical role in human health. Gut bacteria aid digestion, prevent permeability of the gastointestinal tract (which discourages the development of autoimmune disease), synthesize vitamins and provide the foundation for robust immunity.  In essence:Roundup significantly disrupts the functioning of beneficial bacteria in the gut and contributes to permeability of the intestinal wall and consequent expression of autoimmune disease symptoms.In synergy with disruption of the biosynthesis of important amino acids via the shikimate pathway, glyphosate inhibits the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes produced by the gut microbiome.  CYP enzymes are critical to human biology because they detoxify the multitude of foreign chemical compounds, xenobiotics, that we are exposed to in our modern environment today.As a result, humans exposed to glyphosate through use of Roundup in their community or through ingestion of its residues on industrialized food products become even more vulnerable to the damaging effects of other chemicals and environmental toxins they encounter!What’s worse is that the negative impact of glyphosate exposure is slow and insidious over months and years as inflammation gradually gains a foothold in the cellular systems of the body.The consequences of this systemic inflammation are most of the diseases and conditions associated with the Western lifestyle:Gastrointestinal disorders	1.0

Several of the diplomats were recent arrivals at the embassy, which reopened in 2015 as part of former President Barack Obama's reestablishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba.Some of the diplomats' symptoms were so severe that they were forced to cancel their tours early and return to the United States, officials said. After months of investigation, U.S. officials concluded that the diplomats had been exposed to an advanced device that operated outside the range of audible sound and had been deployed either inside or outside their residences. It was not immediately clear if the device was a weapon used in a deliberate attack, or had some other purpose.The U.S. officials weren't authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the U.S. retaliated by expelling two Cuban diplomats from their embassy in Washington on May 23. She did not say how many U.S. diplomats were affected or confirm they had suffered hearing loss, saying only that they had ""a variety of physical symptoms.""The Cuban government said in a lengthy statement late Wednesday that ""Cuba has never permitted, nor will permit, that Cuban territory be used for any action against accredited diplomatic officials or their families, with no exception.""The statement from the Cuban Foreign Ministry said it had been informed of the incidents on Feb. 17 and had launched an ""exhaustive, high-priority, urgent investigation at the behest of the highest level of the Cuban government.""It said the decision to expel two Cuban diplomats was ""unjustified and baseless.""The ministry said it had created an expert committee to analyze the incidents and had reinforced security around the U.S. embassy and U.S. diplomatic residences.""Cuba is universally considered a safe destination for visitors and foreign diplomats, including U.S. citizens,"" the statement said.U.S. officials told The Associated Press that about five diplomats, several with spouses, had been affected and that no children had been involved. The FBI and Diplomatic Security Service are investigating.Cuba employs a state security apparatus that keeps many people under surveillance and U.S. diplomats are among the most closely monitored people on the island. Like virtually all foreign diplomats in Cuba, the victims of the incidents lived in housing owned and maintained by the Cuban government.However, officials familiar with the probe said investigators were looking into the possibilities that the incidents were carried out by a third country such as Russia, possibly operating without the knowledge of Cuba's formal chain of command.Nauert said investigators did not yet have a definitive explanation for the incidents but stressed they take them ""very seriously,"" as shown by the Cuban diplomats' expulsions.""We requested their departure as a reciprocal measure since some U.S. personnel's assignments in Havana had to be curtailed due to these incidents,"" she said. ""Under the Vienna Convention, Cuba has an obligation to take measures to protect diplomats.""U.S. diplomats in Cuba said they suffered occasional harassment for years after the restoration of limited ties with the communist government in the 1970s, harassment reciprocated by U.S. agents against Cuban diplomats in Washington. The use of sonic devices to intentionally harm diplomats would be unprecedented.___"	1.0

These attempts to distort Catholic teaching have weakened the Church’s witness to the truths of the natural and supernatural order and have threatened the well-being of the family, especially its weakest and most vulnerable members.The Apostolic Exhortation Amoris Laetitia is a very lengthy document, which discusses a wide variety of subjects related to the family. There are many passages that faithfully reflect Catholic teaching but this cannot, and does not, lessen the gravity of those passages which undermine the teaching and practice of the Catholic Church. Voice of the Family intends to present full analyses of the serious problems in the text over the coming days and weeks.Voice of the Family expresses the following initial concerns with the greatest reverence for the papal office and solely out of a sincere desire to assist the hierarchy in its proclamation of Catholic teaching on life, marriage and the family and to further the authentic good of the family and its most vulnerable members.We consider that in raising the following concerns we fulfil our duty as clearly laid out in the Code of Canon Law, which states:According to the knowledge, competence, and prestige which they possess, they have the right and even at times the duty to manifest to the sacred pastors their opinion on matters which pertain to the good of the Church and to make their opinion known to the rest of the Christian faithful, without prejudice to the integrity of faith and morals, with reverence toward their pastors, and attentive to common advantage and the dignity of persons. ( Canon 212 §3 )Admission of the “divorced and remarried” to Holy CommunionAmoris Laetitia, over the course of Chapter VIII (paragraphs 291-312), proposes a number of approaches that prepare the way for “divorced and remarried” Catholics to receive Holy Communion without true repentance and amendment of life. These paragraphs include:confused expositions of Catholic teaching on the nature and effects of mortal sin, on the imputability of sin, and on the nature of conscience;the use of ideological language in place of the Church’s traditional terminology;and the use of selective and misleading quotations from previous Church documents.A particularly troubling example of misquotation of previous teaching is found in paragraph 298 which quotes the statement of Pope John Paul II, made in Familiaris Consortio, that there exist situations “where, for serious reasons, such as the children’s upbringing, a man and woman cannot satisfy the obligation to separate.” However in Amoris Laetitia the second half of Pope John Paul II’s sentence, which states that such couples “take on themselves the duty to live in complete continence, that is, by abstinence from the acts proper to married couples” (Familiaris Consortio, No. 84),  is omitted.Furthermore, in the footnote to this misleading quotation, we read:In such situations, many people, knowing and accepting the possibility of living ‘as brothers and sisters’ which the Church offers them, point out that if certain expressions of intimacy are lacking, ‘it often happens that faithfulness is endangered and the good of the children suffers’ (Second Vatican Ecumenical Council, Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World Gaudium et Spes, 51).The document makes reference to this erroneous view but does not explain why it is a false approach, which is namely that: All sexual acts outside of a valid marriage are intrinsically evil and it is never justifiable to commit an intrinsically evil act, even in order to achieve a good end.“Faithfulness is endangered” by acts of sexual intimacy outside of marriage but faithfulness is lived when two individuals in an invalid union refrain from sexual intimacy in fidelity to their original union, which remains valid.The quotation implies that children will suffer because their parents, with the help of divine grace, live chastely. On the contrary, such parents are giving their children an example of fidelity, chastity and trust in the power of God’s grace.The document cites Gaudium et Spes but the passage is quoted out of context and does not support the argument made. The context makes clear that Gaudium et Spes is speaking of married Catholics, in the context of procreation, not those cohabiting in an invalid union. The full sentence is as follows:But where the intimacy of married life is broken off, its faithfulness can sometimes be imperilled and its quality of fruitfulness ruined, for then the upbringing of the children and the courage to accept new ones are both endangered (Gaudium et Spes, No. 51).It is therefore difficult to avoid the conclusion that the Apostolic Exhortation is at least raising the possibility that adulterous sexual acts might in some cases be justifiable and has misquoted Gaudium et Spes as if to provide grounds for this.Other approaches that undermine Catholic doctrine on reception of the sacraments will be discussed by Voice of the Family in due course.Parental rights and sex educationAmoris Laetitia includes a section entitled “The Need for Sex Education” (paragraphs 280-286). This section spans more than five pages without making even one reference to parents. On the other hand there is reference to “educational institutions”. Yet sex education is “a basic right and duty of parents” which “must always be carried out under their attentive guidance, whether at home or in educational centers chosen and controlled by them” (Pope John Paul II, Familiaris Consortio, No. 37). The omission of this teaching seriously fails parents at a time when parental rights regarding sex education are under serious and sustained attack in many nations of the world, and at the international institutions. In this section Amoris Laetitia does not cite any of the previous Church documents that clearly affirm this right; it does however cite a psychoanalyst, Erich Fromm, associated with the Frankfurt school. The document’s earlier references to parental rights (paragraph 84), while welcome, cannot compensate for the exclusion of parents from this section.Homosexual unionsAmoris Laetitia, following an approach similar to that previously adopted in synod documents, implies that “same-sex unions” may offer a “certain stability” and can have a kind of similarity or relation to marriage. It states that:We need to acknowledge the great variety of family situations that can offer a certain stability, but de facto or same-sex unions, for example, may not simply be equated with marriage. (Paragraph 53)There is great pressure at the international institutions for the rejection of the traditional understanding of the family through the adoption of language which refers to “variety” or “diversity” in the forms of the family. The implication that “same-sex unions” form part of the “great variety of family situations” is precisely what pro-family groups are fighting hard to oppose. By using such language the Apostolic Exhortation undermines the pro-family movement’s work to protect the true definition of the family and, consequently, to protect children who depend on the family structure willed by God for their well-being and healthy development.It should be noted that in paragraph 251 the authentic teaching of the Church, that “there are absolutely no grounds for considering homosexual unions to be in any way similar or even remotely analogous to God’s plan for marriage and family” is restated.“Gender ideology”Amoris Laetitia endorses a central aspect of “gender ideology” by asserting that it “needs to be emphasized” that biological sex and socio-cultural ‘gender’ can be “distinguished but not separated” (paragraph 56). This acceptance of the underlying principle of gender theory undermines the document’s otherwise welcome criticism of the ideology and its effects. The false notion that biological sex is distinguishable from so-called “gender” was first proposed in the 1950s and is the foundation of “gender ideology”. Opposition to the consequences of “gender ideology”will be impossible if its erroneous first principle is accepted.Attacks on innocent human lifeAmoris Laetitia fails to grapple with the scale of the threat to unborn children, the elderly and the disabled. Conservative estimates indicate that over one billion unborn lives have been destroyed by abortion over the last century. Yet in a document addressing challenges to the family, which is 264 pages long, there are only a small number of passing references to abortion. There is no mention of the destruction caused by artificial methods of reproduction, which have also resulted in the loss of millions of human lives. The absence of serious discussion of attacks on unborn life in this context is a grave omission.There is also minimal reference to euthanasia and assisted suicide despite the increasing pressure for their legalization across the world. Failure to adequately discuss this threat is likewise another very regrettable omission.ContraceptionAmoris Laetitia fails to adequately restate Catholic teaching on the use of contraception. This is a troubling oversight given that (i) the separation of the procreative and unitive ends of the sexual act is a major catalyst for the culture of death and that (ii) there is widespread disobedience and ignorance of the Church’s teaching in this area precisely because of the failure of the hierarchy to communicate this truth.  The document’s discussion of conscience is likewise flawed both in paragraph 222, which deals with “responsible parenthood”, and in Chapter VIII which deals with the admission to the sacraments of those in public adultery. Paragraph 303 is of particular concern, especially in the following assertion:Yet conscience can do more than recognize that a given situation does not correspond objectively to the overall demands of the Gospel. It can also recognize with sincerity and honesty what for now is the most generous response which can be given to God, and come to see with a certain moral security that it is what God himself is asking amid the concrete complexity of one’s limits, while yet not fully the objective ideal. In any event, let us recall that this discernment is dynamic; it must remain ever open to new stages of growth and to new decisions which can enable the ideal to be more fully realized.This statement seems to adopt a false understanding of the “law of gradualness” and suggest that there are certain occasions when sin is not only unavoidable but even actively willed by God for that person. This would clearly be unacceptable.ConclusionsThis is only a brief introduction to the very numerous problems found within Amoris Laetitia. It will take further study to fully draw out all the implications of the text but it is already abundantly clear that the document fails to give a clear and faithful exposition of Catholic doctrine and leads inescapably to conclusions that could result in violations of the immutable teaching of the Catholic Church, and those disciplines which are inextricably founded upon it. Our initial overview provides sufficient cause to regard this document as a threat to the integrity of the Catholic faith and the authentic good of the family.We reiterate once again that we make these criticisms with great reverence for the office of the papacy but with the consciousness of our duties as lay Catholics towards the good of the Church, and our duties as pro-life/pro-family campaigners to work to protect the family and its most vulnerable members.	1.0

It has recently come to the attention of the College that one of the recommended vaccines could possibly be associated with the very rare but serious condition of premature ovarian failure (POF), also known as premature menopause. There have been two case report series (3 cases each) published since 2013 in which post-menarcheal adolescent girls developed laboratory documented POF within weeks to several years of receiving Gardasil, a four-strain human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV4).1,2 Adverse events that occur after vaccines are frequently not caused by the vaccine and there has not been a noticeable rise in POF cases in the last 9 years since HPV4 vaccine has been widely used.Nevertheless there are legitimate concerns that should be addressed: (1) long-term ovarian function was not assessed in either the original rat safety studies3,4 or in the human vaccine trials, (2) most primary care physicians are probably unaware of a possible association between HPV4 and POF and may not consider reporting POF cases or prolonged amenorrhea (missing menstrual periods) to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), (3) potential mechanisms of action have been postulated based on autoimmune associations with the aluminum adjuvant used1 and previously documented ovarian toxicity in rats from another component, polysorbate 80,2 and (4) since licensure of Gardasil® in 2006, there have been about 213 VAERS reports (per the publicly available CDC WONDER VAERS database) involving amenorrhea, POF or premature menopause, 88% of which have been associated with Gardasil®.5 The two-strain HPV2, CervarixTM, was licensed late in 2009 and accounts for 4.7 % of VAERS amenorrhea reports since 2006, and 8.5% of those reports from February 2010 through May 2015. This compares to the pre-HPV vaccine period from 1990 to 2006 during which no cases of POF or premature menopause and 32 cases of amenorrhea were reported to VAERS.Many adolescent females are vaccinated with influenza, meningococcal, and tetanus vaccines without getting Gardasil®, and yet only 5.6% of reports related to ovarian dysfunction since 2006 are associated with such vaccines in the absence of simultaneous Gardasil® administration. The overwhelming majority (76%) of VAERS reports since 2006 with ovarian failure, premature menopause, and/or amenorrhea are associated solely with Gardasil®. When VAERS reports since 2006 are restricted to cases in which amenorrhea occurred for at least 4 months and is not associated with other known causes like polycystic ovary syndrome or pregnancy, 86/89 cases are associated with Gardasil®, 3/89 with CervarixTM, and 0/89 with other vaccines administered independently of an HPV vaccine.5 Using the same criteria, there are only 7 reports of amenorrhea from 1990 through 2005 and no more than 2 of those associated with any one vaccine type.Few other vaccines besides Gardasil® that are administered in adolescence contain polysorbate 80.6 Pre-licensure safety trials for Gardasil® used placebo that contained polysorbate 80 as well as aluminum adjuvant.2,7 Therefore, if such ingredients could cause ovarian dysfunction, an increase in amenorrhea probably would not have been detected in the placebo controlled trials. Furthermore, a large number of girls in the original trials were taking hormonal contraceptives which can mask ovarian dysfunction including amenorrhea and ovarian failure.2 Thus a causal relationship between human papillomavirus vaccines (if not Gardasil® specifically) and ovarian dysfunction cannot be ruled out at this time.Numerous Gardasil safety studies, including one released recently,8 have looked at demyelinating and autoimmune diseases and have not found any significant problems. Unfortunately, none of them except clinical safety pre-licensure studies totaling 11,778 vaccinees9 specifically addressed post-vaccination ovarian dysfunction. While data from those studies do not indicate an increased rate of amenorrhea after vaccination, the essential lack of saline placebos and the majority of participants taking hormonal contraceptives in those studies preclude meaningful data to rule out an effect on ovarian function.A Vaccine Safety Datalink POF study is planned to address an association between these vaccines and POF, but it may be years before results will be determined. Plus, POF within a few years of vaccination could be the tip of the iceberg since ovarian dysfunction manifested by months of amenorrhea may later progress to POF. Meanwhile, the author of this statement has contacted the maker of Gardasil, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to make known the above concerns and request that (1) more rat studies be done to look at long-term ovarian function after HPV4 injections, (2) the 89 VAERS reports identified with at least 4 months amenorrhea be reviewed by the CDC for further clarification since the publicly available WONDER VAERS database only contains initial reports, and (3) primary care providers be notified of a possible association between HPV and amenorrhea. A U.S. Government Representative responded that they “will continue to conduct studies and monitor the safety of HPV vaccines. Should the weight of the evidence from VAERS or VSD and other sources indicate a likely causal association between POF and HPV vaccines, appropriate action will be taken in terms of communication and public health response.”The College is posting this statement so that individuals considering the use of human papillomavirus vaccines could be made aware of these concerns pending further action by the regulatory agencies and manufacturers. While there is no strong evidence of a causal relationship between HPV4 and ovarian dysfunction, this information should be public knowledge for physicians and patients considering these vaccines.Primary author: Scott S.

In that, we feel there is significant commonality in all of us that allows our community to be so special. That commonality should include aspirations for social justice, freedom of speech in its many forms, and equal opportunity for education and economic advancement regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation or religion.”—Manu Ginobili, in a tweet on Thursday, according to the San Antonio Express-News . Before Wednesday’s game, Spurs players—along with retired legends Tim Duncan and David Robinson—locked arms as the above message was displayed on screens inside the AT&T Center.BIG NEWSChris Gaspard helps remove ruined items from his friend Bryan Parson’s home brought on by flooding in the wake of Hurricane Harvey in Dickinson, Texas.Photo by Win McNamee/Getty ImagesBad DealThe city of Dickinson, in Galveston County, was among the hardest-hit places when Hurricane Harvey’s torrential rains slammed Texas . Residents now seeking Harvey relief face a strange ultimatum: agree not to boycott Israel, or your application for aid will be denied. According to the Houston Chronicle , the city’s hurricane repair grant application , which allows residents to apply for funds to help rebuild a home or business impacted by Hurricane Harvey, includes a surprising stipulation. “By executing this Agreement below, the Applicant verifies that the Applicant: (1) does not boycott Israel; and (2) will not boycott Israel during the term of this Agreement,” it states. The application has gotten the attention of the American Civil Liberties Union, which called the prohibition unconstitutional on Thursday. “The First Amendment protects Americans’ right to boycott, and the government cannot condition hurricane relief or any other public benefit on a commitment to refrain from protected political expression,” Andre Segura, the legal director of the ACLU of Texas, told the Chronicle. “Dickinson’s requirement is an egregious violation of the First Amendment, reminiscent of McCarthy-era loyalty oaths requiring Americans to disavow membership in the Communist party and other forms of ‘subversive’ activity.”MEANWHILE, IN TEXASReal TalkFormer President George W. Bush delivered a harshly worded speech on Thursday. He condemned the divisive actions of President Donald Trump , though he stopped short of actually calling out the president by name. “We’ve seen our discourse degraded by casual cruelty,” Bush said during a sixteen-minute address at “The Spirit of Liberty” event in New York, sponsored by his presidential center. “Bullying and prejudice in our public life sets a national tone and provides permission for cruelty and bigotry. The only way to pass along civic values is to first live up to them.” Bush said our political system has been corrupted by “conspiracy theories and outright fabrication,” and cautioned against the U.S. turning inward under Trump. “We’ve seen nationalism distorted into nativism, forgotten the dynamism that immigration has always brought to America,” Bush said. “We see a fading confidence in the value of free markets and international trade, forgetting that conflict, instability and poverty follow in the wake of protectionism. We’ve seen the return of isolationist sentiments, forgetting that American security is directly threatened by the chaos and despair of distant places.” He took aim at white supremacy too. “Our identity as a nation—unlike many other nations—is not determined by geography or ethnicity, by soil or blood,” Bush said. “This means that people of every race, religion, and ethnicity can be fully and equally American. It means that bigotry or white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the American creed.”On the BrinkThe Houston Astros face a must-win situation Friday night in game six of the American League Championship Series against the New York Yankees. If they win, they live another day, forcing a series-deciding game seven in Houston on Saturday. If they lose, their season is done. As ESPN notes, this is an unusual spot for the ‘Stros to be in. They’ve held onto first place in the American League West for 178 of 183 days during the regular season, every day since April 12, and they held a lead at the end of 25 of 36 innings in the previous round of the playoffs. Even in the ALCS, they were leading or tied through the series’s first nineteen innings, jumping out to a 2-0 series lead. On Friday, the team will turn to starting pitcher Justin Verlander, who dominated the Yankees in the second game of the series, striking out thirteen batters while allowing one run over nine spectacular innings. They’ll also have the support of their home crowd. “Our backs are against the wall,” catcher Brian McCann told ESPN. “We’ll be ready. This team, we’ve played extremely well all season long, and nothing’s going to change. We’ll be ready for game six. We’ve responded all year long.”Fast Food BeefWhataburger is typically considered the undisputed champ of the fast food scene here in Texas, but according to a new ranking by Business Insider , Texans actually prefer California-based chain In-N-Out. Yes, we know, this is truly a travesty. Business Insider’s methodology here is hardly scientific, as it relies solely the publication data from Foursquare, a social media app which lets users “check in” at certain locations, to determine which fast food restaurant was most popular in each state. “For the study, we looked at which chains received the most visits on average in every state based on the total number of visits to each chain divided by the number of locations in that state,” Business Insider wrote. Somehow, that research showed In-N-Out as the top choice among Texans. As the Houston Chronicle notes, In-N-Out only has 35 restaurants in Texas, while Whataburger has nearly 200 locations in the Houston area alone. We think Whataburger still has a leg up on In-N-Out, regardless of what Business Insider says.WHAT WE’RE READINGSome links are paywalled or subscription-only.Laura Bush will appear as a guest in the final season of Fixer Upper  Dallas Morning NewsAustin’s Richard Overton, the oldest living World War II veteran in the U.S., has new digs Austin American-StatesmanA Killeen ISD teacher duct-taped the mouths of ten fifth-graders Killeen Daily HeraldAmazon just opened a giant wind farm in Scurry County CNBCThe death of a pet dog gave a Texan woman “broken-heart syndrome” Washington PostGet Texas Monthly.

It’s why he calls his lab manager, Wade Sanders, “Walter,” after the show’s protagonist, Walter White.And like the famously pure and powerful blue meth White cooked up on Breaking Bad, the product produced by 710 Labs’ fancy equipment is extremely concentrated, powerful, and coveted: butane-extracted hash oil (BHO). The lab’s finished BHO might not look like much—a thin, hard, and shiny brown slab, like peanut brittle without the peanuts—but when a piece of this “shatter,” as it’s called, is placed on the nail of a specially designed pipe that’s been superheated by a blowtorch, it vaporizes and delivers a direct hit of 70 to 90 percent THC, three times the potency of the strongest marijuana strains. As Melshenker puts it, if smoking regular pot is like drinking a beer, “dabbing,” as this process is known, is a shot of hard liquor. Vice calls the result , “The smoothest slow-motion smack in the face of clean, serene stonedness that you’ve ever experienced.” Rolling Stone reports , “Your head spins, your eyes get fluttery, a few beads of sweat surface on your forehead and, suddenly, you're cosmically baked.” Some pot aficionados vow to never smoke the old way again.Gucci Earwax, a butane extraction, made by Mahatma Extreme Concentrates for Karmaceuticals in Denver. It won the first-place medical concentrate trophy at the High Times 2013 Denver U.S. Cannabis Cup.Courtesy of Ry Prichard/CannabisEncyclopedia.comHash, in other words, is no longer just a way to make use of leftover marijuana trim. It’s now becoming the main attraction. (Butane isn’t the only way to extract hash oil from marijuana, either; some concentrate-makers use carbon dioxide– or water-based extraction methods.) At Greenest Green , Melshenker’s Boulder dispensary, the inventory used to be 60 percent marijuana flower, 30 percent BHO, and 10 percent edibles. Now it’s the opposite: 60 percent BHO, 30 percent flower, and 10 percent edibles. And roughly 40 dispensaries statewide contract with 710 Labs to turn their marijuana into shatter or “budder,” a gloopier version. (Because of delays in Boulder’s regulation process, 710 Labs won’t be able to produce recreational BHO until Feb. 17.)AdvertisementHash oil is even fueling its own subculture. Forget 4:20; “dab heads” or “oil kids” light up at 7:10. (Turn the digits upside down and you have “OIL.”) Connoisseurs sport specially designed blowtorches and incredibly pricey “oil rig” pipes; a top-of-the-line rig from Melshenker’s Faulty Pelican glass company sets you back $14,000. There’s even dab gear, made by companies like Grassroots .“There’s a whole industry here,” says Melshenker, whose business card doubles as a stainless-steel dabber, the tool used to apply BHO to an oil rig’s superheated nail.A production process laden with volatile chemicals; a highly concentrated, easily transportable final product; incredibly stoned kids with blowtorches …Colorado’s thriving dabbing scene could just be one more bit of proof that the state is becoming a global mecca for marijuana. After all, the state’s legalized marijuana experiment has so far been an unqualified success. Despite the surprisingly limited number of recreational pot shops that opened their doors on Jan. 1—and the hefty crowds waiting in line to patronize them—the state hasn’t experienced widespread product shortages or weed prices high enough to trigger an Uber-style backlash . Yes, there was that story about 37 deadly marijuana overdoses on the first day of sales , but it turned out to be an obvious hoax. The few pundits who’ve complained about Colorado’s legalized pot, like David Brooks and Nancy Grace, have found their arguments blasted full of holes , not to mention lambasted on Saturday Night Live . The Justice Department is looking into ways to help banks play nice with marijuana businesses — a very serious problem —and even President Obama in a recent New Yorker profile conceded it’s important for the experiment to go forward .Soon enough, then, Colorado’s small-scale experiment should spread far and wide, with controversial drug laws getting the boot, millions of clandestine tokers coming out of the closet, and governments reaping the benefits in taxes and fees. That is unless something goes terribly wrong, derailing the whole legalization movement.AdvertisementSuch a gloomy outcome isn’t out of the question. The only reason that Colorado is enjoying fame as the first place to legalize pot is thanks to a combination of fortunate timing, plucky advocates, forward-thinking lawmakers, and a remarkable lack of snafus. Colorado’s 2012 legalization attempt very well could have floundered if the effort hadn’t enjoyed remarkably positive media coverage. Considering the precipitous rise of the state’s medical marijuana industry and lawmakers’ keen efforts to moderate it, all it could have taken was the right bad headline—a high-profile crime or a boneheaded political move—to set the endeavor back considerably. Recall that alcohol prohibition was built on the temperance movement’s carefully crafted tales of woe and violence. As Salvation Army Commander Evangeline Booth once put it :Drink has drained more blood …Dishonored more womanhood,Blasted more lives,Driven more to suicide, andDug more graves than any other poisoned scourge that ever swept its death-dealing waves across the world.Mixed shatter slab by TC Labs. The product is broken prior to packaging to fit into the 1 gram or less packaging requirements.Courtesy of Ry Prichard/CannabisEncyclopedia.comIn Colorado, however, there have been very few sordid marijuana tales that could be used to demonize the drug—so far. Weed-fueled horror stories could still emerge in the state—and with the world watching, such calamities could have an international impact. So what are the biggest potential risks? A major concern is diversion, taking Colorado’s legal pot and offloading it to the black market or selling it out of state. While Colorado has established an extensive tracking system to prevent this from happening, there will always be tourists trying to take home a pot-infused souvenir. Beyond diversion, there’s the menace of crime—not just the threat of burglaries and organized crime in a largely cash-based industry, but also the distant possibility of banks or other financial institutions getting slapped with federal money laundering charges if they accept any of that free-flowing marijuana cash. Finally, there’s the prospective collateral damage, such as kids accidentally eating pot brownies— something that’s already in the news —or a violent pot-related car crash.If any of these calamities do occur, Colorado’s red-hot dabbing scene could in fact be the source of the problem. Dabbing certainly appears on the surface to be dangerous: Kids are freebasing marijuana! It looks like they’re smoking crack! But it’s important to remember that there’s no evidence that it’s possible to overdose on pot. (Compared to say, acetaminophen, overdoses of which killed more than 1,500 Americans during the past decade.) So you can smoke the strongest dab imaginable—or even, if you’re a showboat, smoke 50 dabs in a row —and science says it won’t kill you. It will just get you really, really high.Mars OG ISO dab, an isopropyl alcohol extraction made by Pink House Labs in Denver.Courtesy of Ry Prichard/CannabisEncyclopedia.comAdvertisementBut just because something won’t poison you the way alcohol can doesn’t mean it can’t lead you to do something stupid enough that will kill you. And there seem to be enough disconcerting variables associated with dabbing culture—a production process laden with volatile chemicals; a highly concentrated, easily transportable final product; and incredibly stoned kids with blowtorches—it seems only a matter of time until somebody in the scene does something very stupid and possibly fatal.Yes, dabbing might not be as inherently dangerous as, say, a bar full of binge-drinkers. But it’s important to remember that recreational marijuana isn’t necessarily replacing alcohol use—it’s just adding a new legal vice to the options people already have. While some researchers predict legalized marijuana will decrease alcohol use , others predict it could lead to “heavy drinking” and “carnage on our highways.” So will folks really reach for a dabbing pipe instead of a shot glass—or will they reach for both?Top CommentNobody tell these fellows about vaporizers. They're going to worry about them detonating the atmosphere, or causing glaciers to melt, or something.   More...-J P McMahonJoin InQuestions like this have led California and Washington to outlaw the production of smokeable marijuana concentrates. Colorado, however, has gone the opposite route: In November it released a draft of proposed concentrate production rules , positioning itself to become the only place in the world where marijuana concentrate production is both legal and regulated. The idea is to police the blooming subculture, to stay on top of it, so it ends up more akin to tattooing than meth. “If we outlaw concentrates, people will make them in their basements and blow themselves up,” says Norton Arbelaez, co-owner of the Denver dispensary RiverRock Wellness , which operates a concentrate production facility. But just because a concentrate extraction system is certified by a third-party industrial hygienist, as will likely be required by Colorado’s concentrate rules, doesn’t mean that system can’t still accidentally blow up.It makes sense that Colorado is at the vanguard of legalized dabbing. It’s made a habit of taking risks when it comes to marijuana. Colorado can’t regulate away the chance that dabbing or some other marijuana-related endeavor will lead to a spectacular accident, either industrial or personal. But so far its legalization effort has taken pains to thoughtfully minimize such risks—and so far, it’s working.	1.0

Center for Biological DiversityThis story was updated at 6:33 p.m. EST.Looking for some Trump wine for the holiday?Head no farther than Shenandoah National Park, where you can pick it up at the Skyland Resort.That's according to Bill Snape, senior counsel at the Center for Biological Diversity, who wants to get to the bottom of why it's sold there.""Even as we sit down for Thanksgiving dinner on Thursday, Trump wine is everywhere — how?"" Snape said in an interview today.AdvertisementHoping to find answers, Snape filed a request under the federal Freedom of Information Act, asking the National Park Service to provide records regarding the sale of wine and other alcoholic beverages at Shenandoah and other national parks.The request also asks NPS to produce any records or documents that mention Trump, his family members or Trump merchandise.Snape said the discovery of the wine at Shenandoah was first made by one of the center's members, who took photos of the bottles but wants to remain anonymous.""She just stumbled across it and obviously got a little fired up and upset. I checked it out and confirmed it,"" Snape said.Snape added that the issue raises more questions on the extent to which Trump's role as commander in chief collides with his role ""as chief of the Trump empire ... with no understanding of where it begins and where it ends.""""If this is the level of Trumpism at national parks, what other policy issues have that level of Trumpism?"" Snape said. ""It just raises a number of disturbing and intriguing conflict-of-interest issues.""Jeremy Barnum, spokesman for the National Park Service, said the wine is not being sold by Shenandoah National Park, but rather by Delaware North Cos. Inc., the park's licensed concessioner.""The National Park Service authorizes concessioners to sell categories of retail goods and products like t-shirts, baseball hats, and in this case wine. However, the NPS does not specify what brands of these products should be sold,"" Barnum said. ""The concessioner has been selling wine from the distributor of this particular winery in Virginia for years."""	1.0

https://www.snopes.com/hillary-bill-clinton-russia-sanctions-speech/	Did Hillary Clinton Side With Kremlin on Sanctions Due to a $500,000 Payment to Bill?	unverified	['dnc hack', ' donald trump', ' fox news', ' hillary clinton', ' magnitsky act', ' russia investigation', ' sanctions', ' sergei magnitsky', ' wikileaks']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/hRd2u	2017/07/20	Now PlayingEmails show Bill Clinton paid thousands for speech in RussiaThe Russian lawyer who landed a meeting with Donald Trump Jr. during last year’s presidential campaign with the promise of dirt on Hillary Clinton had one big thing in common with the Democratic candidate: Both had opposed Russia sanctions targeting human-rights abusers. Further, former Secretary of State Clinton’s initial opposition coincided with a $500,000 speech her husband gave in Moscow – a link her 2016 campaign fought to downplay in the press, according to WikiLeaks-released documents.Trump White House officials now are trying to draw attention to that speech and the Clintons’ ties to Russia in a bid to counter criticism over Trump Jr.’s now-infamous meeting. “If you want to talk about having relationships with Russia, I'd look no further than the Clintons,” Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at a briefing last week. “Bill Clinton was paid half a million dollars to give a speech to a Russian bank, personally thanked by President Putin.”“With the help of the research team, we killed a Bloomberg story trying to link HRC’s opposition to the Magnitsky bill a $500,000 speech that WJC gave in Moscow.”- May, 2015 email from Clinton campaign stafferThe former president indeed had received a personal call from then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin expressing his appreciation for the speech. According to Mrs. Clinton’s ethics disclosure form filed while she was secretary of State, Bill Clinton was paid $500,000 by the Russia-based finance company Renaissance Capital for his June 29, 2010, speech in Moscow to its employees and guests attending the company's annual conference. The speech is now coming back to haunt the Clintons, considering the company that cut the check was allegedly tied to the scandal that spurred the Global Magnitsky Act, a bill that imposed sanctions on Russians designated as human-rights abusers and eventually would become law in 2012.Related ImageExpand / CollapseFormer President Bill Clinton with his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton  (AP)This was the same law Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya was lobbying against during her sit-down with Trump Jr. last year. And back in 2010, it would have put the Clintons on her side. Shortly before Bill Clinton’s speech in 2010, when members of Congress pushing the sanctions bill had asked Hillary Clinton to refuse visas to Russian officials implicated under the policy, the State Department denied the request. The Obama administration initially was opposed to the Magnitsky Act because then-President Barack Obama was seeking a “reset” with Russia and did not want to deepen the divide between the two countries.Former President Bill Clinton’s speech to Renaissance just weeks later was all the more curious, considering Renaissance’s Russian investment bank executives would have been banned from the U.S. under the law. Fast-forward to 2015, and the timeline apparently had caught the attention of Bloomberg News. Related ImageExpand / CollapsePortrait of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky held by his mother Nataliya Magnitskaya during 2009 press conference in Moscow.  (The Associated Press)According to a memo from Clinton’s presidential campaign team later published by WikiLeaks , however, the Clinton campaign was able to stop the presses.“With the help of the research team, we killed a Bloomberg story trying to link HRC’s opposition to the Magnitsky bill a $500,000 speech that WJC gave in Moscow,” Jesse Lehrich, on the Rapid Response Communications team for Hillary For America, boasted on May 21, 2015. The Global Magnitsky Act was named for 36-year-old tax attorney Sergei Magnitsky, who died in the custody of the Russian government after accusing the government and organized crime of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from a foreign company, Hermitage Capital Management. Magnitsky, hired by foreign investor and Hermitage owner William Browder, had tracked what turned out to be hundreds of millions of dollars in tax fraud. He reported the fraud to the Russian authorities, but instead of pursuing charges against the alleged offender, Russian authorities jailed Magnitsky.After Magnitsky died in November 2009, Browder said Magnitsky proved Renaissance officials were among those orchestrating the scheme. The State Department finally reversed its position in 2011 and refused visas to some Russians purportedly involved in the financial fraud seeking to enter the country.The Magnitsky Act passed with bipartisan support in 2012.Russia retaliated against the U.S., ending any possibility for Americans to adopt Russian orphans and also banning 18 U.S. officials from entering their country.Malia Zimmerman is an award-winning investigative reporter focusing on crime, homeland security, illegal immigration crime, terrorism and political corruption.

That decision, to play both sides and continue the divisiveness of Barack Obama, has now cost them dearly.Nike, the largest athletic company and number one sponsor of professional sports in the world, has canceled all dealings with the Dallas Cowboys. Company CEO Isaac P. Freely told Fox Sports:“To come out on the field and kneel to thugs and criminals just before saluting the flag was a reprehensible move our company won’t easily forgive. The Dallas Cowboys are no longer licensed to wear, display or sell merchandise with the Nike name or logo on it.”Owner Jerry Jones says he will fight the move, stating that he was showing his players that he was with them but still managed to see that every one of them stood for the National Anthem.Sorry, Jerry, but it isn’t about the National Anthem anymore, it’s about respect.

Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, told Fox News host Sean Hannity on Friday that he discovered Friday that it fell to him to shut down the government — “which is kind of cool.”Welcome to the whatever shutdown.The attitude permeating the Trump administration reflects, to some degree, the confidence that comes from finding that the world keeps spinning every time they do something they’ve been warned would have dire consequences, like withdrawing from the Paris climate accord or announcing plans to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.According to a half-dozen White House officials and outside advisers, Trump is viewing the shutdown through a similar lens, a view encouraged by White House aides, including senior adviser Stephen Miller and congressional liaison Marc Short, who urged him on Friday not to give in to Democratic demands, particularly on immigration.Several presidential advisers expressed confidence that Democrats, who offered no philosophical objections to the 30-day continuing resolution approved by House Republicans, wanted to make a statement but don’t want to hurt federal workers, tens of thousands of whom will be staying home from work without pay if government funding isn’t restored by Monday morning.Two presidential aides said they expect the current crisis to be resolved by the end of the weekend.But Democrats themselves are sending a different message, at least publicly — giving no indication they are ready to buckle to pressure. “It’s important,” Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said of the shutdown’s impact on federal workers. “But I was just at the women’s march this morning, and there are a lot of federal workers there and … they were basically: ‘You need to stand up to this guy.’”One House Democrat said he was relieved his party had finally “grown a spine.”The most reliable politics newsletter.Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning — in your inbox.EmailSign UpBy signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.The White House has responded by shrugging it off, hewing to a consistent message: This shutdown won’t hurt as much as the one President Barack Obama oversaw five years ago.Mulvaney drew the comparison repeatedly on Saturday, telling reporters that national parks and monuments would remain open, though they were closed in 2013; that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would continue to protect Americans from this year’s flu outbreak; and that, in another departure from five years ago, the activities of the Environmental Protection Agency would continue uninterrupted.He also argued that Democrats today are being more unreasonable than were Republicans in 2013. “We were asked to vote for something in 2013 that we did not approve of,” said Mulvaney, who, as a South Carolina congressman, supported the 2013 shutdown because the government-funding bill required lawmakers to approve funding for Obamacare, a federal program to which they vehemently objected.Other West Wing aides were playing it cool as well.Whose Fault Is the Shutdown?By POLITICO STAFF“This seems so banal compared to 2013, when the two sides were actually fired up and there was a cause,” said a senior presidential aide. The 2013 shutdown, precipitated by Republican attempts to prevent funds from flowing to the Affordable Care Act, lasted 17 days. “Everybody figures this is going to resolve itself by the end of the weekend,” the aide said.“It will be nothing compared to Obama’s shutdown,” said another senior White House official, though the 2013 shutdown was roundly blamed on Republicans.Trump himself, who has yet to appear in public since the shutdown early Saturday morning, is sticking with the message that Democrats will take most of the heat, though he privately joked to staff that he knows he’ll get blamed — because he always does.Though he hasn’t appeared before the cameras, he was active on Twitter throughout the day on Saturday, writing: “This is the One Year Anniversary of my Presidency and the Democrats wanted to give me a nice present. #DemocratShutdown .”In photos released late Saturday by the White House, Trump and top staff appeared relaxed and smiling.Joyce N. Boghosian/Official White House photoWhite House aides said that they think Trump’s Twitter microphone is enough, and they don’t believe the president needs to make official remarks to bring the shutdown to a close.Indeed, Trump’s own erratic behavior in negotiations last week — including his remarks to lawmakers that many immigrants come from “shithole” countries — helped precipitate the breakdown in spending talks on the Hill by hardening the positions among party rank-and-file on both sides and giving Democrats a ready-made excuse to walk away from the negotiating table on immigration.Since then, he’s been a bit player in the shutdown drama — the absence of his direction and leadership driving events more than their presence.By BRENT D. GRIFFITHSThe irony is that while many had high hopes that Trump’s election augured a new era of bipartisanship in the country, the government shutdown is the clearest evidence yet that that hasn’t materialized.Instead, a year into his first term, the president — who won the election railing against the political system — finds himself trapped inside it, waiting for the political leaders he holds in contempt to set him free.Annie Karni and Seung Min Kim contributed to this report.	1.0

Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco), who said the current law discriminated against those who have human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, the precursor to AIDS, because exposure to other communicable diseases is a misdemeanor.The same reduction in crime level would apply to people who donate blood or semen without disclosing that they have tested positive for HIV or AIDS.Read More— Phil Willon (@philwillon) October 19, 2017AdvertisementOct. 2, 2017, 3:23 p.m.California LegislatureCalifornia farmworkers will have to undergo sexual assault prevention trainingGov.

(Associated Press / AFP/Getty Images)One-third of  Californian taxpayers could be forced to pay thousands more in federal taxes  from the repeal of one deduction under a GOP proposal released Wednesday, setting up another political dilemma for California Republicans facing tough reelection battles next year as Democrats work to win back the House of Representatives.The potential repeal of the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, which allows taxpayers to write off those taxes on their federal returns, would hit especially hard in wealthier areas, some of which are on the exact turf Democrats are trying to win over in Southern California.Details of the overall tax reform plan have yet to be worked out, but so far, vulnerable California Republicans are not joining GOP colleagues in other states who have said they won’t accept the repeal of the deduction, and some of them seem willing to negotiate."	1.0

The contamination has also resulting in the closure of fishing industries.Worryingly, new studies reveal that fish caught off the West coast of the United States and in Canada are also being tested positive for radiation poisoning.This page is forcing your browser to use legacy mode, which is not compatible with Disqus.

Portlands city council on Wednesday voted 3 to 1 in favor of the Equal Use Act, a new resolution granting individuals who identify as furries the same rights afforded to dogs and their respective owners who frequent popular off-leash areas and dog parks in the greater Portland area.The decision comes on the heels of a four-day sit-in organized by PDX Furs, a regional furry community based in the Portland metro area, which staged the protest at Portlands city council offices on Milwaukie Avenue last weekend. This is a huge victory, said Bo Kirkman. Not just for furries here in Portland but furries living all across the United States.Bo, a former kindergarten teacher and self-described furry rights advocate, told the Portland Tribune that he identifies as a dog. Its one thing to say you cant bring your cat or your ferret or whatever to the off-leash areas because obviously theyre not dogs. But if I want to go to the park and play with my owner, well as a canine, that should be my right.Now, thanks to the City of Portland, Bo and his fellow furries can take advantage of the citys designated off-leash areas. Provided they respect and adhere to the posted rules and regulations at our city parks, said Public Affairs commissioner Dan Saltzman who sits on the city council and voted in favor of the resolution.According to the City of Portlands official website, dog park visitors are expected to pick up and dispose of their pets waste and are advised to leave sick animals at home. In an effort to prevent the spread of disease, we ask that owners refrain from allowing their dogs  or furries  drink from standing water, Saltzman said.However, not everyone is celebrating the new resolution.. I think its rediculous, said council-member Amanda Fritz who sits on the Portland Parks Board and voted against the proposal. Were allowing people in costumes to frolic about and fornicate to their hearts content in our public parks.Mrs. Fritz may be alone in her sentiments. Portland mayor Charlie Hales told the Daily Journal of Commerce that the Equal Use Act is synonymous with Portlands unofficial slogan.

It’s a double standard. There shouldn’t be a black history month. We’re Americans, period.” Well, she definitely started a conversation… and has agreement in unexpected places:1.  Listen to what famous rapper Waka Flocka said:He said:“But honestly, I always felt like that. Like why the f**k we got BET? BET is for black people and MTV is for white people? Think about it. Why the f**k we got Black History Month only in February?

The explosion, which appears to have originated in the basement, was heard nearly three miles away. The closest neighbor, a farm nearly a mile away, felt what they thought was a “mild earthquake. When first-responders arrived on site, they found a huge hole in the center of the ranch and bodies strewn about the surrounding area.Fire Marshall Sandy Batternofski said that the blast looked like the product of some sort of illegal activity:“There was a massive amount of pressure built up from something before it ignited. Then it burned so fast it incinerated everything in its path. The victims look like overcooked chicken wings. Gonna be tough to ID them.”We asked Police Chief Matt Schmidt what he thought and he never skipped a beat when he said:“Meth. No doubt about it. Al’s got some explaining to do.”Ex-Senator Franken, who lives in a penthouse in Minneapolis with his mistress, told police he hadn’t been to the ranch in over a year and that his brother Randy was looking after it for him. When asked about the obvious existence of a meth lab, Franken snorted and hung up the phone.We’ll update the story when the bodies are identified.     .About Flagg Eagleton  44 ArticlesFlagg Eagleton is the son of an American potato farmer and a patriot.

He was taking summer classes at his high school and left the classroom for what was supposed to be a quick call to a documentary crew preparing a feature on the rivalry with De La Salle High School in Northern California.“I stepped outside to make the phone call and I ran into a classmate of mine,” Banks says.Her name was Wanetta Gibson. She was a friend. She was 15.“We met, hugged, started talking and agreed to go to an area on our campus that was known as a make-out area,” Banks says. “We went to this area and made out. We never had sex.”By the end of the day, Banks was in custody, accused of raping Gibson on the school’s campus. But we never had sex, Banks pleaded. Nobody believed him.“I was being arrested and accused of kidnapping and rape,” he says. “I was taken into custody that same day and the judge put a bail on me that was too high for me to post bond. It was over $1 million.”He languished in juvenile hall for an entire year before his case came up. He was to be tried as an adult and if found guilty, faced 41 years to life. His football dreams effectively died that summer day in the stairwell of his school.Life isn’t fair.Brian Banks was an innocent man.Brian Banks weeps upon hearing judge clear his name in May of 2012.(Brittany Murray/ASSOCIATED PRESS)***After turning down three plea deals that would have put him in prison for 25, 18 or nine years, Banks was told on the day of jury selection “that I had no chance in trial because I was a big, black teenager and the jury would be an all-white jury and they would automatically assume me as guilty because of that,” Banks says.Gibson was also black, as was Banks’ attorney. As the jury was about to be selected, Banks was offered a deal to plead guilty to one count of rape under the condition that the other charges would be dropped. He would then undergo a 90-day observation at Chino State prison and would be interviewed and evaluated by psychologists and counselors “who would determine on a ladder system whether I would receive probation or three or six years prison,” Banks says. “I was promised and guaranteed by my attorney that I would get probation if I took the plea. I was also told that if I didn’t take it, I would more than likely be found guilty and receive life in prison.”He was 17 years old. “Do I plead to a crime that I did not commit and receive a small sentence or do I roll the dice, risk my entire life behind bars for a crime I didn’t commit?” he says. “I realized that day, regardless of whatever my decision was, neither one of them was going home an innocent man.”All he could think about was getting his life back, going home, playing football, finishing his high school education, enrolling at USC. They put him in a room and gave him 10 minutes to make his decision. He sat there crying. “I was unable to speak to my mom. I was denied that right,” he says. “At the age of 17, I felt like 90 days was doable after already spending a year behind bars.”He underwent the 90-day observation. The psychologist and counselor recommended probation. The judge gave him six years. He had never been in trouble before, not even a speeding ticket. He sat in the holding cell, held both hands up, shaking uncontrollably as he figured out that he would have to serve 85% of the six years. He had already served one year. That meant he still had just over four years remaining.“Just the trauma and the stress that I had already dealt with that first year, it was unimaginable how I was going to do another four years,” he says.He went to jail with career criminals. He was angry, depressed, hostile. He saw fights, stabbings, killings right in front of him, riots, lockdowns.He saw hell.Banks lost 10 years of his life, a frightful five years and two months in prison followed by five years of high custody parole.After his release in 2007, he moved back in with his mother, a second-grade schoolteacher who had sold her house and car to pay his attorney fees. At 22 he tried to resume his football career at Long Beach City College. He played in a game two days after his release, a good way to take out aggression. But after playing a handful of games before the season ended, a new law went into effect in California requiring sex offenders to wear an ankle GPS tracking device, making it impossible for him to play football.He had already registered as a sex offender and couldn’t live within 2,000 yards of a school or park. He had trouble finding work.“I wanted revenge,” Banks says. “I wanted people to be held accountable for the things that happened to me.”The past is the past. It already happened. Tomorrow is a mystery.Life’s not fair, Banks thought. I’m an innocent man.***Three years ago, Banks was checking his Facebook account and got a start. He had been home for four years working odd jobs, still carrying the label of sex offender. But there, staring him in the face, was a friend request.“It was her,” Banks says, “the girl who had accused me nine years ago.”Banks still doesn’t know her reasoning for selling him down the river when she knew they never had sex and there was no DNA trace on her underwear. Maybe it was the $1.5 million she collected from the Long Beach school system, claiming it was an unsafe environment (the city is trying to recoup $2.6 million from her now). Banks thinks maybe Gibson was afraid her older sister, who went to the same high school, would find out she made out with him and tell her mother. Or that he would brag to friends. Maybe she thought he would just be suspended. He doesn’t think she was trying to put him in jail. He also thinks perhaps a school security guard saw her leaving the stairwell with him, asked what she was doing and if she wanted to do it.“Oh well, then he raped you,” Banks surmises the guard said.“We don’t really know what the truth really is as to why she lied,” he says. “I never really got a clear reason.”Banks never had contact with her from the day they made out until that day on Facebook in 2011.He asked why she would request him.“I was hoping we could let bygones be bygones,” Banks says Gibson wrote. “I was immature back in the day, but I’m much more mature now. Let’s hang out. I’d love to see you. I’ve seen your picture on Facebook. You look real good. I would love to hook up.”Banks obviously had no interest.His parole agreement didn’t allow him any contact with her. Banks called a private investigator and said he felt there was an opportunity for her to tell the truth and he wanted it recorded.“In the event that I violated my parole conditions coming into contact with her and was sent back to prison, I wanted them to at least know what was said,” Banks says. “I took a big risk. I knew this was the only opportunity to prove my innocence by her admitting she lied.”In 2013, Atlanta's Brian Banks faces Cincinnati.(Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images)He invited Wanetta Gibson to the investigator’s office. They spoke with the investigator monitoring in another room. Banks wanted her to understand what she did to his life. He asked her to come back the second day to speak to the investigator.“Did he rape you? Did he kidnap you?” the investigator asked.Banks said she laughed it off and said, “Of course not. If he raped me, I wouldn’t be here right now. We were just young and having a good time, being curious, then all these other people got involved and blew it out of proportion.”It was all on tape. Banks took it to the California Innocence Project, which took his case and appealed it.One year later, three months before he was to come off parole, Banks was cleared.On May 24, 2012, the same Los Angeles Superior Court judge who had sentenced Banks to six years in prison when he begrudgingly accepted a plea bargain for a crime he did not commit after he was led to believe he would get probation, took less than one minute to dismiss his conviction.He was already a free man. But now he had his freedom.“My record is cleaner than yours,” he says.He’s not bitter, he’s not looking for an apology. He didn’t sue anybody.“When you put yourself in position where you have to make a decision whether you forgive somebody or you don’t, that means you are still dealing with it,” Banks says. “I’m not dealing with it anymore. The past is the past. It already happened. Tomorrow is a mystery.”***Banks tried football again after gaining back his full freedom. Carroll, the coach Banks wanted to play for at Southern Cal and the first coach to give him a tryout once he was exonerated in 2012, and who will be coaching in his second consecutive Super Bowl next Sunday, brought him to Seattle for a tryout the day after all charges were dropped.Banks remembers when his cell phone rang.Brian Banks has a moment with his mother, Leomia Myers and father, Jonathan Banks, outside courthouse.(Nick Ut/ASSOCIATED PRESS)“I’m looking for a linebacker. You know where I can find one?” the caller says.“You got the right number. Who is this?” Banks says.“Pete Carroll,” he says. “You’ve been out of the game 10 years. I don’t know what the hell you can do. But I’m going to fly you out here because I know how hard you work. I just want to see what you can do.”One year before he was exonerated, Banks had been up to 290 pounds. He then started training and within three months was down to 245 pounds when he went to Seattle.“It was a terrible tragedy in a young man’s life, to be falsely accused like that and have to give up years of his life,” Carroll said in an e-mail to the Daily News. “I don’t think anyone could’ve handled something like that any better. He was strong, gracious and compassionate, and he exhibited great character and integrity.”Banks was thrilled to hear from Carroll.“We reconnected and it was like we were back on that same path to where we left off recruiting,” he says. “Here we were once again.”But the football part didn’t work out. It had been too long.“I tried out. They were impressed,” Banks says. “They invited me back to camp. I trained in camp with them. They decided it was a little premature and they decided not to roll with me.”He had tryouts with the 49ers, Chiefs, Vikings, Chargers, Eagles and Falcons.Nobody signed him. It had been 10 years since he had really played.“You could tell he had missed some years of ball,” Carroll says. “He missed out on the physical development a college athlete gets and all that comes with that process. He missed the opportunity to hone his physical and mental skills as it relates to football, but his competitiveness shined through and he battled so hard for that chance, and did a phenomenal job with his opportunity.”Former Giants coach Jim Fassel then signed Banks for the Las Vegas Locomotives of the United Football League. He played linebacker and special teams before the league folded during the 2012 season after Banks had played in just a couple of games.Brian Banks exits court after his kidnap-rape conviction was dismissed.(Brittany Murray/AP)“I heard about his story and as a coach, you just say ‘Gosh sakes, what this man has gone through and his attitude is still positive,’ ” Fassel says by phone last week. “This guy deserved somebody to give him a chance. It was amazing he wasn’t bitter, but he was really, really raw.”The Falcons reached out again in 2013, signed him in the offseason, brought him to camp. He played in all four preseason games, but was let go on the final cut from 75 players to 53.Banks, officially, was done. He was just 28 years old. His formative years in football were spent shuttling between adult prisons in California.“He was an all-star player and set himself apart in high school, so if he had gotten the chance, it’s clear he definitely could’ve been a legitimate NFL prospect,” Carroll said.***Who knows what would have happened to Banks if his life had not been derailed?“I don’t really wonder. I know,” Banks says. “I know I would have been a force to be reckoned with in the NFL.""Banks is 29 now and dressed in a dark suit sitting in the office of Troy Vincent, the NFL’s executive vice president of football operations, in the league’s Park Avenue headquarters. He began working for the NFL in the football operations department at the beginning of the 2014 season. On game days, he helps out in the officiating department with replays.Vincent and Roger Goodell brought him in because he’s a bright and eager guy. He also has a riveting message that might make an impact on some of the players in the NFL.“Very few people could even endure what happened to Brian, much less emerge with such resilience and determination,” Vincent says. “I saw a young man who was dealt a bad hand, but he refused to allow it to deter him from pursuing his dream to be part of the NFL.""Now he might be on his way to becoming a star in the NFL office.“He’s a great guy,” Goodell says.For Banks, the dream is once again alive.“If you ask me, I made an NFL roster and that’s here in the front office in New York,” he says. “I still wear the shield. I accomplished a dream that was taken away from me.”He now does volunteer work for the California Innocence Project. A movie is being made about his life. Banks also has developed a business speaking to schools all over the country. He has a strong message and an appropriate T-shirt.It’s a California license plate that says, XONR8. Sign up for BREAKING NEWS Emails"	1.0

https://www.snopes.com/cashews-equivalent-to-a-dose-of-prozac/	Are Two Handfuls of Cashews Equivalent to a Dose of Prozac for Depression?	false	['antidepressants', ' dangerous memes', ' david avocado wolfe', ' depression', ' newz magazine']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/9n36j	2016/12/30	SEND Pinterest Google Skype Reddit-Cashew nuts are one of the healthiest foods in the world. Unfortunately, not many of you know the numerous benefits they offer, and only a very small percentage of the natural medicines comprehensive database is dedicated to them.Countries like Nigeria, Tanzania, Mozambique and Brazil are the biggest producers of cashew nuts, mostly due to the fact that they need hot and humid climate in order to grow.Health Benefits of Cashew NutsCashew nuts are rich in vitamins, soluble dietary fiber, minerals and many phytochemicals that prevent diseases, including cancers. Cashews are also rich in calories, about 50 grams of these favorable foods contain 275 calories.These beneficial nuts provide numerous essential vitamins, including pantothenic acid or vitamin B5, pyridoxine or vitamin B6, thiamin or vitamin B11 and riboflavinThe aforementioned vitamins are crucial for metabolism of fat, protein and carbs at a cellular level. On the other hand, niacin improves the protection against pellagra or dermatitis.Furthermore, B6 is extremely beneficial for our health for it significantly lowers the chances of developing sideroblastic anemia and homocystinuria. Only 3.5 Oz (100 gr) of these nuts provide about 30% of daily recommended levels of B6 (that’s about 0.147 mg).Moreover, cashews are also rich in essential minerals. Some of the most useful minerals found in cashew nuts are potassium, manganese, copper, selenium, magnesium, zinc and iron. Only a handful of these nuts on a daily basis can provide the necessary amount of these extremely needed minerals and protect you from deficiency- related diseases.For instance, copper acts as a co-factor for many important enzymes, like superoxide dismutase and cytochrome c- oxidase. Zinc, on the other hand, plays the same role together with enzymes that are responsible for the regulation of the growth and progress of digestion, gonadal function and DNA synthesis. Selenium is a very important micronutrient and it works as a co-factor for antioxidant enzymes like Glutathione peroxides, known as one of the strongest antioxidants in human body.Monounsaturated fatty acids which are in high quantities in these nuts are extremely good for the heart health, as palmitoleic and oleic acids. They belong to the group of essential fatty acids that can increase the level of good HDL cholesterol and decrease the level of harmful LDLcholesterol in our blood. In addition, as shown by many scientific studies, the so-called Mediterranean diet which is mostly based on monounsaturated fatty acids supports the blood lipid profile, and protect our system from strokes and coronary artery diseases.Furthermore, cashews also contain a small quantity of one very important pigment of flavonoid antioxidants, called zeaxanthin, which is selectively absorbed inside the retinal macula in our eyes. This pigment provides protective and antioxidant UV ray filtering features, and it also protects from ARMD or age-related macular degeneration in old people.How Treat Depression Naturally – A Basic Guide to Cashew NutritionCashew nuts are more than great source of tryptophan, which is a vital amino acid our body needs to take it throughout the food. This amino acid helps children develop and grow, regulates mood, balances our behavior, improves sleep and can significantly lower the level of stress, anxiety and depression.Just two handfuls of cashews contain somewhere between 1.000 and 2.000 mg of tryptophan. This compound has been proven to be as equally successful as prescription antidepressants. The best thing about treating depression with cashews is that you will surely avoid side effects that are usually caused by antidepressants. Of course, this is yet another thing big pharma carefully hides from us.According to FDA Deputy Commissioner for Policy’s David Adams, who was part of the Drug Information Association Annual Meeting back in 1993, we need to pay close attention to the things happening around the legal arena and dietary supplements. If producers of natural remedies manage getting the support, there will most likely be a completely new class of products, which will be competing with the already existing drugs. This is why we need a special law that will have the function to regulate the supplements.In addition, back in 1993, FDA Dietary Task Force has released a report saying that the selling and existence of dietary supplements will not jeopardize efforts for creating new drugs.Sponsored by Revcontent	1.0

The 2003 painting by Simmie Knox shows a smiling Clinton sporting one of her signature pantsuits, standing by a table with her book, “It Takes a Village,” by her side.ADVERTISEMENTThe White House calls this year’s theme “The Gift of the Holidays,” one that “reflects on not only the joy of giving and receiving, but also the true gifts of life, such as service, friends and family, education, and good health.”Supersized versions of the presidential pooches, Bo and Sunny, greet guests in the East Wing Hallway. The first dog-inspired creations, which measured slightly taller than ITK’s towering 5’4” frame, were crafted from more than 25,000 yarn pom-poms.A tree adorned with gold stars represents “The Gift of Service,” which pays homage to first lady Michelle ObamaMichelle LeVaughn Robinson Obama Michelle Obama celebrates success of ‘Black Panther’ How textbooks shape teachers — not just their students Michelle Obama dedicates Valentine's Day playlist to Barack Obama MORE and Dr. Jill Biden’s Joining Forces initiative, aimed at supporting military service members and their families. Kiosks with touch screens can be used to pen a note to send to troops.Another snowy display might prove more controversial. Not only do snowmen occupy the space next to the Clinton portrait — they line the entire hall.Similar snowmen stoked fear among the Washington press corps last year, when ITK tweeted a picture of a countless number of ever-smiling figures peering into the White House from outside. Bloomberg White House correspondent Justin Sink dubbed the frozen creatures “nightmare fuel.”But everything is awesome in the State Dining Room, with 56 gingerbread houses — one for each state and territory — created out of Legos. South Dakota’s gingerbread house features a pretty impressive Lego version of Mount Rushmore. More than 200,000 of the colorful blocks were used to decorate the room, and Lego master builders spent 500 hours designing and crafting the structures.In the Green and Red rooms, visitors can find a seasonal ode to Michelle Obama’s “Let’s Move!” anti-childhood obesity initiative, with wreaths made of lemons and garlands created using limes. The fruit-filled rooms also feature gift boxes made out of cranberries.This year’s White House gingerbread house was whipped up using 150 pounds of gingerbread on the inside and 100 pounds of bread dough on the outside. The behemoth baked good also includes 20 pounds of gum paste, 20 pounds of icing and 20 pounds of sculpted sugar pieces.A sugary sweet Bo and Sunny stand outside the massive confection, along with a giant gingerbread man and woman. The gingerbread woman is seen holding a gingerbread baby.But even the spicy-sweet smell of the sugar-coated display couldn’t get one journalist salivating over the gigantic treat. “Can we all accept now that gingerbread is only good as a building material?” a photographer quipped. 	1.0

Brendan McDermid/ReutersShareU.S.Last week, Bill O’Reilly returned from a European vacation to find that he had been fired from Fox News for a history of alleged sexual misbehavior that is impressively wide-ranging, even for the Viagra warehouse that has functioned for near decades as the mouthpiece of the Republican Party.This week, O’Reilly left for vacation again; his destination this time was not Italy but the Isle of Unreality, a remote location favored by right-wingers seeking to escape lawsuits and facts.No longer will O’Reilly be a factor, so to speak, in the fortunes of the right-wing cable news channel that brought his visage, puckered with outrage, into the homes of millions. Even as advertisers fled his show over the past two months, he crushed the competition like a Republican congressman in Texas, drawing 3.8 million per night viewers in early April. Now, all he has is a measly podcast, No Spin News, and a website that does an excellent impression of 1999.Keep up with this story and more by subscribing nowO’Reilly’s first post-firing podcast went live on Monday. Television endowed O’Reilly with a kind of gleeful menace that was weirdly captivating for those of us who disagreed with him on everything, including the title of “journalist” he gave himself; unseen, he loses power—and seems to know it. Yet at heart, the project is the same, a promise of “no spin” bolstered by sturdy beams of vitriol and misinformation.O’Reilly began with pure, uncut, right-into-your-bloodstream spin, also known as damage control. “I am sad that I am not on television anymore,” he said. “I was surprised how it all turned out.” He may mean that he thought the $13 million he and Fox News paid out to various accusers ensured their silence. Or maybe he thought that a recent endorsement from Donald Trump—“I don't think Bill did anything wrong”—would save him.But O’Reilly really wasn’t going to spend all his podcast time talking about that unseemly business, not with the forces of liberalism amassing at the borders of Real America. There was much news to cover, many spins to un-spin or stop the spins from spinning or cause to the spins to spin in a countervailing motion, thereby creating a spin-neutral zone. He began by denouncing numbers, specifically those tied to President Trump’s approval ratings. If those numbers seem low, he explained, it’s not because Trump has been an ineffectual, easily distracted head of state but because the mainstream media “deceive” Americans “on a daily basis.”I can’t claim to be a regular Fox News viewer, but I’ve seen and heard enough of O’Reilly (Mom loves the guy…) to know that something was amiss on this podcast. The day’s news was a slab of red meat, but instead of tearing into it, O’Reilly timidly nibbled at the edges. When I hear the boredom in O’Reilly’s voice, I worry for the future of the Republic.“Don’t react to these polls,” he advised Trump, like a weary coach telling his charges to hustle. O’Reilly had to know that Trump had already reacted to those polls on Twitter (you can imagine how), so why offer political advice that’s not only hackneyed but outdated?Little else about the 20-minute show was remarkable—which was the most remarkable thing about it. Without much gusto, he covered the French election (“Marnie” Le Pen) and conservative commentator Ann Coulter’s feud with the University of California at Berkeley (“a place I would never in a million years go to”).“Interesting,” he said of the Berkeley issue. “Very, very interesting.” To show just how interesting it was, he followed with a long “um…”Frankly, I could have used a little, um, spin. In what I take as an ominous sign, the word of the day flashed in a banner atop the O’Reilly website. The word on Monday was sciolistic, which means “concerned with or comprehending only what is apparent or obvious; not deep or penetrating emotionally or intellectually.”Was some dastardly young web editor trolling O’Reilly? Or was O’Reilly nobly unspinning himself? The latter is unlikely. Like the man in the Oval Office, O’Reilly never backs down when presented with evidence of his own misconduct or deception. To the contrary, both men puff up their chests and grow indignant, mistakenly thinking that they stand on high ground, when they are in fact treading along the crumbling edge of a cliff.“I’m very confident the truth will come out,” O’Reilly said at the opening of his podcast.It already has, Bill."	1.0

Find more coverage here .Two decades ago, the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein invited Ashley Judd to the Peninsula Beverly Hills hotel for what the young actress expected to be a business breakfast meeting. Instead, he had her sent up to his room, where he appeared in a bathrobe and asked if he could give her a massage or she could watch him shower, she recalled in an interview.“How do I get out of the room as fast as possible without alienating Harvey Weinstein?” Ms. Judd said she remembers thinking.In 2014, Mr. Weinstein invited Emily Nestor, who had worked just one day as a temporary employee, to the same hotel and made another offer: If she accepted his sexual advances, he would boost her career, according to accounts she provided to colleagues who sent them to Weinstein Company executives. The following year, once again at the Peninsula, a female assistant said Mr. Weinstein badgered her into giving him a massage while he was naked, leaving her “crying and very distraught,” wrote a colleague, Lauren O’Connor, in a searing memo asserting sexual harassment and other misconduct by their boss.“There is a toxic environment for women at this company,” Ms. O’Connor said in the letter, addressed to several executives at the company run by Mr. Weinstein.An investigation by The New York Times found previously undisclosed allegations against Mr. Weinstein stretching over nearly three decades, documented through interviews with current and former employees and film industry workers, as well as legal records, emails and internal documents from the businesses he has run, Miramax and the Weinstein Company.During that time, after being confronted with allegations including sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact, Mr. Weinstein has reached at least eight settlements with women, according to two company officials speaking on the condition of anonymity. Among the recipients, The Times found, were a young assistant in New York in 1990, an actress in 1997, an assistant in London in 1998, an Italian model in 2015 and Ms. O’Connor shortly after, according to records and those familiar with the agreements.In a statement to The Times on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Weinstein said: “I appreciate the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it. Though I’m trying to do better, I know I have a long way to go.”He added that he was working with therapists and planning to take a leave of absence to “deal with this issue head on.”Lisa Bloom, a lawyer advising Mr. Weinstein, said in a statement that “he denies many of the accusations as patently false.” In comments to The Times earlier this week, Mr. Weinstein said that many claims in Ms. O’Connor’s memo were “off base” and that they had parted on good terms.ImageSome of Mr. Weinstein’s films include, from left to right, “Sex, Lies, and Videotape,” “Pulp Fiction” and “Good Will Hunting.”He and his representatives declined to comment on any of the settlements, including providing information about who paid them. But Mr. Weinstein said that in addressing employee concerns about workplace issues, “my motto is to keep the peace.”Ms. Bloom, who has been advising Mr. Weinstein over the last year on gender and power dynamics, called him “an old dinosaur learning new ways.” She said she had “explained to him that due to the power difference between a major studio head like him and most others in the industry, whatever his motives, some of his words and behaviors can be perceived as inappropriate, even intimidating.”Though Ms. O’Connor had been writing only about a two-year period, her memo echoed other women’s complaints. Mr. Weinstein required her to have casting discussions with aspiring actresses after they had private appointments in his hotel room, she said, her description matching those of other former employees. She suspected that she and other female Weinstein employees, she wrote, were being used to facilitate liaisons with “vulnerable women who hope he will get them work.”The allegations piled up even as Mr. Weinstein helped define popular culture. He has collected six best-picture Oscars and turned out a number of touchstones, from the films “ Sex, Lies, and Videotape ,” “ Pulp Fiction ” and “ Good Will Hunting ” to the television show “ Project Runway .” In public, he presents himself as a liberal lion, a champion of women and a winner of not just artistic but humanitarian awards.In 2015, the year Ms. O’Connor wrote her memo, his company distributed “ The Hunting Ground ,” a documentary about campus sexual assault. A longtime Democratic donor, he hosted a fund-raiser for Hillary Clinton in his Manhattan home last year. He employed Malia Obama, the oldest daughter of former President Barack Obama, as an intern this year, and recently helped endow a faculty chair at Rutgers University in Gloria Steinem’s name. During the Sundance Film Festival in January, when Park City, Utah, held its version of nationwide women’s marches, Mr. Weinstein joined the parade.ImageHarvey Weinstein and Hillary Clinton in 2012. Mr. Weinstein held a fund-raiser for Mrs. Clinton at his Manhattan home last year.CreditLarry Busacca/Getty Images“From the outside, it seemed golden — the Oscars, the success, the remarkable cultural impact,” said Mark Gill, former president of Miramax Los Angeles when the company was owned by Disney. “But behind the scenes, it was a mess, and this was the biggest mess of all,” he added, referring to Mr. Weinstein’s treatment of women.Dozens of Mr. Weinstein’s former and current employees, from assistants to top executives, said they knew of inappropriate conduct while they worked for him. Only a handful said they ever confronted him.Mr. Weinstein enforced a code of silence; employees of the Weinstein Company have contracts saying they will not criticize it or its leaders in a way that could harm its “business reputation” or “any employee’s personal reputation,” a recent document shows. And most of the women accepting payouts agreed to confidentiality clauses prohibiting them from speaking about the deals or the events that led to them.Charles Harder, a lawyer representing Mr. Weinstein, said it was not unusual to enter into settlements to avoid lengthy and costly litigation. He added, “It’s not evidence of anything.”At Fox News, where the conservative icons Roger E. Ailes and Bill O’Reilly were accused of harassment, women have received payouts well into the millions of dollars. But most of the women involved in the Weinstein agreements collected between roughly $80,000 and $150,000, according to people familiar with the negotiations.In the wake of Ms. O’Connor’s 2015 memo, some Weinstein Company board members and executives, including Mr. Weinstein’s brother and longtime partner, Bob , 62, were alarmed about the allegations, according to several people who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In the end, though, board members were assured there was no need to investigate. After reaching a settlement with Mr. Weinstein, Ms. O’Connor withdrew her complaint and thanked him for the career opportunity he had given her.“The parties made peace very quickly,” Ms. Bloom said.Through her lawyer, Nicole Page, Ms. O’Connor declined to be interviewed. In the memo, she explained how unnerved she was by what she witnessed or encountered while a literary scout and production executive at the company. “I am just starting out in my career, and have been and remain fearful about speaking up,” Ms. O’Connor wrote. “But remaining silent is causing me great distress.”In speaking out about her hotel episode, Ms. Judd said in a recent interview, “Women have been talking about Harvey amongst ourselves for a long time, and it’s simply beyond time to have the conversation publicly.”A Common NarrativeMs. Nestor, a law and business school student, accepted Mr. Weinstein’s breakfast invitation at the Peninsula because she did not want to miss an opportunity, she later told colleagues. After she arrived, he offered to help her career while boasting about a series of famous actresses he claimed to have slept with, according to accounts that colleagues compiled after hearing her story and then sent on to company executives.“She said he was very persistent and focused though she kept saying no for over an hour,” one internal document said. Ms. Nestor, who declined to comment for this article, refused his bargain, the records noted. “She was disappointed that he met with her and did not seem to be interested in her résumé or skill set.” The young woman chose not to report the episode to human resources personnel, but the allegations came to management’s attention through other employees.Across the years and continents, accounts of Mr. Weinstein’s conduct share a common narrative: Women reported to a hotel for what they thought were work reasons, only to discover that Mr. Weinstein, who has been married for most of three decades, sometimes seemed to have different interests. His home base was New York, but his rolling headquarters were luxury hotels: the Peninsula Beverly Hills and the Savoy in London, the Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc near the Cannes Film Festival in France and the Stein Eriksen Lodge near the Sundance Film Festival.ImageThe Peninsula Beverly Hills, a hotel where Mr. Weinstein has been accused of sexually harassing women in the entertainment industry.CreditFG/Bauer-Griffin, via Getty ImagesWorking for Mr. Weinstein could mean getting him out of bed in the morning and doing “turndown duty” late at night, preparing him for sleep. Like the colleague cited in Ms. O’Connor’s memo, some junior employees required to perform those tasks said they were disturbing.In interviews, eight women described varying behavior by Mr. Weinstein: appearing nearly or fully naked in front of them, requiring them to be present while he bathed or repeatedly asking for a massage or initiating one himself. The women, typically in their early or middle 20s and hoping to get a toehold in the film industry, said he could switch course quickly — meetings and clipboards one moment, intimate comments the next. One woman advised a peer to wear a parka when summoned for duty as a layer of protection against unwelcome advances.Laura Madden, a former employee who said Mr. Weinstein prodded her for massages at hotels in Dublin and London beginning in 1991, said he had a way of making anyone who objected feel like an outlier. “It was so manipulative,” she said in an interview. “You constantly question yourself — am I the one who is the problem?”Oct. 5, 2017“I don’t know anything about that,” Mr. Weinstein said.Most women who told The Times that they experienced misconduct by Mr. Weinstein had never met one another. They range in age from early 20s to late 40s and live in different cities. Some said they did not report the behavior because there were no witnesses and they feared retaliation by Mr. Weinstein. Others said they felt embarrassed. But most confided in co-workers.Ms. Madden later told Karen Katz, a friend and colleague in the acquisitions department, about Mr. Weinstein’s overtures, including a time she locked herself in the bathroom of his hotel room, sobbing. “We were so young at the time,” said Ms. Katz, now a documentary filmmaker. “We did not understand how wrong it was or how Laura should deal with it.”Others in the London office said the same. “I was pretty disturbed and angry,” said Sallie Hodges, another former employee, recalling the accounts she heard from colleagues. “That’s kind of the way things were.”The human resources operation was considered weak in New York and worse in London, so some employees banded together in solidarity. “If a female executive was asked to go to a meeting solo, she and a colleague would generally double up” so as not to be alone with Mr. Weinstein, recalled Mr. Gill, the former president of Miramax Los Angeles.Many women who worked with Mr. Weinstein said they never experienced sexual harassment or knew of anyone who did, and recalled him as a boss who gave them valuable opportunities at young ages. Some described long and satisfying careers with him, praising him as a mentor and advocate.But in interviews, some of the former employees who said they had troubling experiences with Mr. Weinstein asked a common question: How could allegations repeating the same pattern — young women, a powerful male producer, even some of the same hotels — have accumulated for almost three decades?“It wasn’t a secret to the inner circle,” said Kathy DeClesis, Bob Weinstein’s assistant in the early 1990s. She supervised a young woman who left the company abruptly after an encounter with Harvey Weinstein and who later received a settlement, according to several former employees.Speaking up could have been costly. A job with Mr. Weinstein was a privileged perch at the nexus of money, fame and art, and plenty of his former assistants have risen high in Hollywood. He could be charming and generous: gift baskets, flowers, personal or career help and cash. At the Cannes Film Festival, according to several former colleagues, he sometimes handed out thousands of dollars as impromptu bonuses.Mr. Weinstein was a volcanic personality, though, given to fits of rage and personal lashings of male and female employees alike. When a female guest of his had to wait for a hotel room upgrade, he yelled that Ms. O’Connor would be better off marrying a “fat, rich Jewish” man because she was probably just good for “being a wife” and “making babies,” she wrote in her memo. (He added some expletives, she said.) His treatment of women was sometimes written off as just another form of toxicity, according to multiple former employees.In the fall of 1998, a 25-year-old London assistant named Zelda Perkins confronted Mr. Weinstein. According to former colleagues, she and several co-workers had been regularly subjected to inappropriate requests or comments in hotel rooms, and she was particularly concerned about the treatment of another woman in the office. She told Mr. Weinstein that he had to stop, according to the former colleagues, and that she would go public or initiate legal action unless he changed his behavior.Steve Hutensky, one of Miramax’s entertainment lawyers, was dispatched to London to negotiate a settlement with Ms. Perkins and her lawyer. He declined to comment for this article.Ms. Perkins, now a theater producer in London, also declined to comment for this article, saying that she could not discuss her work at Miramax or whether she had entered into any agreements.Months after the settlement, Mr. Weinstein triumphed at the Oscars, with “ Life Is Beautiful ” and “ Shakespeare in Love ” winning 10 awards. A few years later, Mr. Weinstein, who had produced a series of British-themed movies, was made a Commander of the British Empire, an honorary title just short of knighthood.‘Coercive Bargaining’For actors, a meeting with Mr. Weinstein could yield dazzling rewards: scripts, parts, award campaigns, magazine coverage, influence on lucrative endorsement deals. He knew how to blast small films to box office success, and deliver polished dramas like “The King’s Speech” and popular attractions like the “Scary Movie” franchise. Mr. Weinstein’s films helped define femininity, sex and romance, from Catherine Zeta-Jones in “Chicago” to Jennifer Lawrence in “Silver Linings Playbook.”ImageThe actress Ashley Judd in the 1997 film “Kiss the Girls.” Ms. Judd said that Mr. Weinstein sexually harassed her two decades ago in his room at the Peninsula.CreditParamount Pictures, via PhotofestBut movies were also his private leverage. When Mr. Weinstein invited Ms. Judd to breakfast in Beverly Hills, she had been shooting the thriller “ Kiss the Girls ” all night, but the meeting seemed too important to miss. After arriving at the hotel lobby, she was surprised to learn that they would be talking in his suite; she decided to order cereal, she said, so the food would come quickly and she could leave.Mr. Weinstein soon issued invitation after invitation, she said. Could he give her a massage? When she refused, he suggested a shoulder rub. She rejected that too, she recalled. He steered her toward a closet, asking her to help pick out his clothing for the day, and then toward the bathroom. Would she watch him take a shower? she remembered him saying.“I said no, a lot of ways, a lot of times, and he always came back at me with some new ask,” Ms. Judd said. “It was all this bargaining, this coercive bargaining.”To get out of the room, she said, she quipped that if Mr. Weinstein wanted to touch her, she would first have to win an Oscar in one of his movies. She recalled feeling “panicky, trapped,” she said in the interview. “There’s a lot on the line, the cachet that came with Miramax.”Not long afterward, she related what had happened to her mother, the singer Naomi Judd, who confirmed their conversation to a Times reporter. Years later, Ashley Judd appeared in two Weinstein films without incident, she said. In 2015, she shared an account of the episode in the hotel room with “ Variety ” without naming the man involved.ImageIn 1997, Mr. Weinstein reached a settlement with the actor Rose McGowan after an episode in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival. She had just appeared in the movie “Scream,” above.CreditDimension Films, via PhotofestIn 1997, Mr. Weinstein reached a previously undisclosed settlement with Rose McGowan, then a 23-year-old-actress, after an episode in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival. The $100,000 settlement was “not to be construed as an admission” by Mr. Weinstein, but intended to “avoid litigation and buy peace,” according to the legal document, which was reviewed by The Times. Ms. McGowan had just appeared in the slasher film “ Scream ” and would later star in the television show “Charmed.” She declined to comment.Increased ScrutinyJust months before Ms. O’Connor wrote her memo, a young female employee quit after complaining of being forced to arrange what she believed to be assignations for Mr. Weinstein, according to two people familiar with her departure. The woman, who asked not to be identified to protect her privacy, said a nondisclosure agreement prevented her from commenting.Soon, complaints about Mr. Weinstein’s behavior prompted the board of his company to take notice.In March 2015, Mr. Weinstein had invited Ambra Battilana, an Italian model and aspiring actress, to his TriBeCa office on a Friday evening to discuss her career. Within hours, she called the police. Ms. Battilana told them that Mr. Weinstein had grabbed her breasts after asking if they were real and put his hands up her skirt, the police report says.The claims were taken up by the New York Police Department’s Special Victims Squad and splashed across the pages of tabloids, along with reports that the woman had worked with investigators to secretly record a confession from Mr. Weinstein. The Manhattan district attorney’s office later declined to bring charges.But Mr. Weinstein made a payment to Ms. Battilana, according to people familiar with the settlement, speaking on the condition of anonymity about the confidential agreement.The public nature of the episode concerned some executives and board members of the Weinstein Company. (Harvey and Bob Weinstein together own 42 percent of the privately held business.) When several board members pressed Mr. Weinstein about it, he insisted that the woman had set him up, colleagues recalled.Ms. Battilana had testified in court proceedings against associates of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy who are accused of procuring women for alleged sex parties, and the Italian news media also reported that, years ago, Ms. Battilana accused a septuagenarian boyfriend of sexual harassment, a complaint that was apparently dismissed. Ms. Battilana did not respond to requests for comment. Her lawyer, Mauro Rufini, could not be reached for comment.After the episode, Lance Maerov, a board member, said he successfully pushed for a code of behavior for the company that included detailed language about sexual harassment.Then Ms. O’Connor’s memo hit, with page after page of detailed accusations. In describing the experiences of women at the company, including her own, she wrote, “The balance of power is me: 0, Harvey Weinstein: 10.”She was a valued employee — Mr. Weinstein described her as “fantastic,” “a great person,” “a brilliant executive” — so the complaint rattled top executives, including Bob Weinstein. When the board was notified of it by email, Mr. Maerov insisted that an outside lawyer determine whether the allegations were true, he said in an interview.ImageMr. Weinstein in 1999 with the winners of the best-picture Oscar for “Shakespeare in Love.”CreditHector Mata/Agence France—PresseBut the inquiry never happened. Mr. Weinstein had reached a settlement with Ms. O’Connor, and there was no longer anything to investigate.“Because this matter has been resolved and no further action is required, I withdraw my complaint,” Ms. O’Connor wrote in an email to the head of human resources six days after sending her memo. She also wrote a letter to Mr. Weinstein thanking him for the opportunity to learn about the entertainment industry.Rachel Abrams and William K. Rashbaum contributed reporting.

Use of Bluetooth-equipped devices has stretched across the globe, yet the technologys origins and name can be traced to an engineer obsessed with making computers function using as little energy as possible.Power is one of the key attributes. Battery life is life. Its the life of the product. To ignore that is totally unacceptable. You have to design things to work efficiently, but more importantly, do nothing efficiently, said Jim Kardach, retired chief power architect at Intel.Originally intended as a wireless replacement for cables to connect phones, headsets, computers, keyboards and mice, Bluetooth technology has proliferated over the past decade, allowing devices in close proximity to connect while using very little battery power.The headsets are ubiquitous, but according to the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) they are only one of many product types that make up the 9 billion Bluetooth devices in the world today. That number keeps growing. Over the next 2 years, annual Bluetooth device shipments are expected to double from 2 to 4 billion, according to ABI Research.Intel mobile computing engineer Jim Kardach was instrumental in bringing together Ericsson, IBM, Intel, Nokia and Toshiba to form the Bluetooth SIG in 1998. That group created the universal standard that is used by more than 17,000 member companies.Kardach recalls playing the role of instigator and mediator among the founding companies, but says the group quickly agreed on a common goal to create a small, low-power consuming, low-cost, short-range radio with built-in security and the ability to connect ad hoc with other devices. Inspired by a book about Vikings that he was reading at the time, he came up with the Bluetooth name.Just days before he retired in December, Kardach reflected on his 27-year career at Intel, including the genesis of Bluetooth, the many low-power design breakthroughs that led to 100 patents and his work on the first notebook system-on-chip (SoC) sold in the 1980s by Intel called the 386SL/486SL.How did you get involved with the creation of Bluetooth?I got the assignment in 1997 when my boss at the time came up to me and said, Youre finishing up the ACPI stuff, can you figure out how to integrate wireless into the notebook?We got together Ericsson, Nokia, Toshiba and IBM. That probably represented 60 percent of both the cellphone and notebook markets at the time. The key was to define the goals of what we wanted to do. We formed a SIG, all agreeing that we wanted to build this universal, very low-cost, private, wireless cable.We did it under an open IP (intellectual property) policy, allowing us to take the best pieces from everywhere and put them together. We had goals on what we wanted this thing to cost and strategies for it being built on a bulk CMOS process, which hadnt been done before. It had security, privacy and had to work across the world, so we picked the ISM band, which required fixing some of the regulatory issues around it. We had a term sheet that everyone agreed to and we put it together. Intel became the leader simply because we had IBM and Toshiba who didnt trust each other, and Ericsson and Nokia who didnt trust each other, so we were kind of the Switzerland.How does a chief power architect look at things?The idea for the Bluetooth name came from Jim Kardach of Intel, who was reading a historical novel about Vikings and King Harald Bluetooth at the time.Power is one of the key attributes. Battery life is life. Its the life of the product. To ignore that is totally unacceptable. You have to design things to work efficiently, but more importantly, do nothing efficiently. Those are the two rules of power management.We rely on architectural designs to lower power use. We design chips to turn things off and back on only when theyre needed. We architect things to minimize latency and anticipate when something is needed so it gets turned on just in time.We used to rely on randomness, like when you drive to work and hope to miss all of the red lights, but more recently weve purposely tried to line up activities in order to create big idle gaps between these activities. If the idle gaps are long enough, we can shut off all of the power. For example, we now have special offloading accelerators that run to do specialized media loads and then be able to put the rest of the platform to a low-power state, which means 98 percent of it is powered off.Hardware not designed for power management can be like crying babies that wake up the whole house. They ping memory every couple of milliseconds or microseconds, keeping the CPU out of its low-power state. This can keep memory and the busses between them alive. A Bluetooth radio should require about a milliwatt of power, but when you put it on a USB plug, because of the way the bus was architected, it generates an extra 6 watts of power by pinging memory every millisecond. These are things we want to catch up front when architecting for good power management.The fourth-generation Intel Core processors that use an SoC design are coming out soon. Whats the advantage of SoCs over traditional CPU designs?SoC allows you to do things that arent possible if you have a handful of chips from different venders. We have the advantage of doing our own chipsets and CPUs, which allows us to design power management between them and the rest of the platform.In the 1980s I worked on the 3SL and 4SL SoCs. We were doing it in an era where we were cramming hundreds of thousands of transistors on a die and now we can fit billions. We can now take advantage of Moores Law and increased capacity that were getting from bigger wafers and smaller transistors. This lets us integrate more capabilities into a small chip. Having an SoC allows us to bring power management across the platform.With the 3SL, we added new operating modes to the CPU that pulled some power management underneath the operating system. This work is still used today. To design an SoC, sometimes you have to trade off time to market but you can really take advantage of them to manage power consumption.This content was originally published on the Intel Free Press website.'	1.0

If no winning tickets had been sold on Wednesday the jackpot would have rolled over again, pushing the annuitized prize to an estimated $2 billion, with a cash value of $1.24 billion.

They show a teacher demonstrating how to use a strap-on sex toy in a number of different positions.In one image, the teacher even shows how to insert the strap-on while her buttocks are in the air and her legs up over her head.In another image, the woman shows the children how to wear a harness to which the strap-on is attached.Clinton Middle School in Duval County hired 39-year-old Sharon Mercer to teach the sex education class but after the photos emerged she was suspended and the school refused further comment. Mercer claimed her suspension was an act of “bigotry” because she was a “proud member of the LGBTQ community.”Newly implemented Common Core educational standards have been assailed for their attempt to create a lowest common denominator form of teaching which many assert only works to dumb down lessons and prevent smart students from excelling.The teaching of so-called “alternative” sexual lifestyles is being practiced in many states under Common Core as a result of sexual content finding its way into other subjects. A school district in Arizona banned a Common Core-approved book last year after it was found to contain sexually explicit passages that described scenes of bondage.Common Core, which is being federally imposed on states across the nation, is a huge shift in teaching which opponents assert will eviscerate critical thinking and generally lower standards in the name of inclusiveness and political correctness. Numerous examples have emerged of Common Core style exam questions which only serve to cause more confusion and frustration.Perhaps the most infamous example of how Common Core will manifest itself in America’s schooling system was illustrated by a bizarre video in which a Common Core curriculum director said that 3 x 4 = 11 could be considered a correct answer so long as students could explain how they reached that number.Common Core’s sex education content has also faced fierce criticism, with one group even claiming that it represents “pornography” which serves to desensitize children to sexual contact and could lead to an increased chance of molestation within the schooling system.Common Core approved book aimed at 11th graders contains sexually explicit scenes of bondage.“What is taught includes teaching inappropriate sexuality skills, that shouldn’t even be taught in college,” writes Joseph R. John . “According to child psychologists, the children are not mentally equipped to understand the detailed sexual indoctrination starting in kindergarten, they are indoctrinated in sexual practices that they should never be exposed to.”“There is a heavy socio political content of sex throughout Common Core curriculum being taught in every grade and in every subject, the student is taught that there is a sameness of gender, there is no longer simply boys and girls according to Common Core,” notes John. “The sexual content of Common Core crosses into every curriculum taught, from teaching sexuality skills in sex education courses by specially skilled and trained sex education teachers. Sexual activities and content in included in every subject taught. Sex is taught in the English curriculum, is included in the language curriculum, sex is woven into the science curriculum, in the math curriculum, in the social studies curriculum, and of course in biology.”As the backlash grows, more and more states are considering abolishing Common Core altogether, with Indiana’s decision earlier this year to ditch the program seen as a victory for conservatives.FOLLOW Paul Joseph Watson @ https://twitter.com/PrisonPlanet*********************Paul Joseph Watson is the editor at large of Infowars.com and Prison Planet.com .  Print this page.	1.0

The area is known to be the home of several gators, although there have been few cases of anyone receiving serious injuries from gator attacks in the area. That said, approaching a wild gator to take a photo is definitely not recommended.“I’ve lived in Pensacola all my life,” said one witness, who was walking her dogs along the trail, “but never have I seen anyone take such a big risk, and for so little.” According to the witness, the New Zealand tourist, who is yet to be formally named, deviated from the trail despite being warned by several locals that the gator may attack. “She risked her life to take a photo with a gator? It’s madness, why would you do a thing like that?”Numerous onlookers were horrified as the woman approached a gator that was resting on the edge of the trail in a patch of sun. “I pleaded with her to get back onto the trail,” said one male witness, “but she said she was just going to take a selfie and told me not to worry about it.” The woman proceeded to take out her phone and prepare for the selfie, but moments later the alligator lashed out, covering the distance between itself and the tourist in seconds.Related Articles23 Women Inappropriately Dressed For Walmart?These content links are provided by Content.ad .

We saw the gator grab her between his jaws, and there was a sharp cry as he dragged her into the bushes, and then just a strange stillness.” The authorities were summoned almost immediately but nothing could be done. “A few hours later we found a purse which we believe belonged to the victim, but no sign of her body has been found.”The identity of the New Zealand woman who perished in the attack has not yet been revealed, although it is believed she was visiting relatives in Pensacola. Authorities have reminded tourists to the region to not take any risks and be aware of the dangers posed by alligators. “For some visitors who are unfamiliar with the strength and speed of these animals, they may be complacent and not appreciate how dangerous they can be. We want to urge tourists to take precautions, and don’t risk your life over getting a photo with an alligator, as it might just kill you.”In other news making headlines, a 29-year old Alabama woman has been hailed as a hero after she was able to fight off a man during an attempted rape. However, her story has sparked some controversy after it emerged that she cut off the rapist's genitals and forced him to eat them.Popular Stories"	1.0

His decision comes after a shooting at a high school in nearby Parkland, Fla. left 17 dead and others injured.Courtesy of Ben DickmannBen Dickmann has been hunting since he was a child. The 40-year-old Florida man enjoyed going out on the gun range to practice firing at targets and was the proud owner of an AR-57, a semi-automatic rifle.But, after 17 people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School by a former student using a semi-automatic rifle, Dickmann, who lives just over 30 minutes away in Fort Lauderdale, did something unexpected.Dickmann turned in his AR-57 to the sheriff's office and asked them to destroy it. He posted about it on Facebook, and that post has now gone viral. It's been shared more than 100,000 times.Dickmann spoke to NPR's Michel Martin about his love of the firearm and why he decided to give it up.Interview HighlightsOn the decision to turn in his AR-57It's come after a lot of soul searching. Everybody always says - you know, it's the big argument right now - everybody's offering thoughts and prayers but nothing else. And I thought, well, this is something I can do that I think is right. And it's something I can do that might spark a change. You know, my whole goal was maybe to inspire one friend on my Facebook page to do the same thing. And maybe that friend would inspire one other person. And who knows? I totally didn't expect for this to go the way it did and as fast as it did.On the issue of obtaining a concealed carry/weapon permitThe concealed weapons permit program here in the state of Florida, as far as I'm concerned, is a joke. Literally, it's three hours of PowerPoint, and then you go down to the range with a very, very low caliber handgun, and you have to put five out of 10 rounds on a paper plate at 5 feet. Probably half the class that I had are people that had never touched a gun before in their life.On the challenge to give up his AR-57After Las Vegas, I had thought long and hard about it, and thought, well, you know, it's not hurting anything sitting in my gun safe here. But it wasn't really until this last tragedy at Stoneman Douglas where it really hit home with us - and me.Actually, one of my friends on Facebook rather sarcastically said, well, if you really feel this way, why don't you go turn in your gun at Broward Sheriff's Office? I'll even drive you. And that's what spurred me to think. Even though he was being extremely sarcastic about it because he's a very staunch conservative, gun rights activist person, it kind of spurred me to say, you know what? Yeah, I'll do that.On what he plans to do nextFor me, to be honest, I'm not sure. It's a lot to process, and nothing that I had this grand master plan going into this for. So I'm happy that this sparked a debate and hopefully causes some action. I hope somebody - be it the students, be it the next generation - picks up the torch and does something.NPR's Digital News intern Asia Simone Burns produced this story for the Web.

https://www.snopes.com/amelia-bassano-william-shakespeare/	Amelia Bassano: The True Shakespeare?	false	['amelia bassano', ' bassano', ' literature', ' sonnets', ' william shakespeare', ' william shakespeare plays']	http://njjewishnews.com/	http://njjewishnews.com/njjn.com/022808/ltKosherBard.html	2015/08/20	Special to the NJJNFebruary 28, 2008John Hudson is a man with a mission. Seven years ago, the 54-year-old social theorist embarked on a literary adventure, following a long-nursed hunch about Shakespeare’s true identity.Hudson had spent most of his adult life grappling with complex questions that straddled the fields of social theory and cognitive science, creating high-level strategic redesign for the energy, telecommunications, Internet, and public sectors.“Most of my work involved helping media companies rethink their industries,” says Hudson. “Now I’ve moved on to rethinking the Shakespearean industry.” With his life and plays comprising a billion-dollar global industry, says Hudson, the Bard has managed to secure a sublime place in literary history as well as an omnipresence in pop culture and media. “But, like all industries, it rests on certain assumptions,” says Hudson. It is these very assumptions — primarily about who the author of the plays really was — that Hudson set about to reinvent.Hudson had an uneasy feeling that there was more beneath the plays’ surface than was brought to light by scholars and historians. His search began in earnest after he enrolled in a postgraduate program at the Shakespeare Institute at the University of Birmingham — in Stratford-upon-Avon, naturally — where he spent four years delving into the texts.He gradually devised the latest approach to Shakespearean authorship, the Amelia Bassano Theory — recently recognized by the Shakespearean Authorship Trust as one of the top eight authorship theories.The figure of Amelia Bassano Lanyer had turned up before in Shakespearean scholarship. In 1973, celebrated historian A.L. Rowse identified her as the actual “Dark Lady” of Shakespeare’s famed sonnets. Bassano — known as the first woman in England to have published a book of original poetry (Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum, 1611), which has been interpreted as an early feminist critique of the Christian Gospels — was part of a family of Italian court musicians of Moroccan/Semitic ancestry who lived as clandestine Jews.Hudson explains that the unusual circumstances of Amelia’s upbringing accounted for her extraordinary education and literary sensitivity. By age seven, she was adopted by the Countess of Kent, who provided her with a well-rounded education, including studies in Greek, Latin, and the Bible. By 13, she became mistress to Lord Henry Hunsdon, the man in charge of the English theater and patron of the Lord Chamberlain’s Men — the company that performed Shakespeare’s works.The plays certainly suggest that their author had access to scholarly training as well as exposure to certain specific environments — all of which coincide with Amelia’s biography. The 2,000 musical references, for example, were her birthright; the hundreds of references to plants, law, military life, and falconry could likely be the result of her involvement with Hunsdon. Other subject matter in the plays echoes her childhood experiences.But most important, Hudson discovered her key “literary signatures” — in which Amelia left her name spread across various plays. Her married name Lanier — meaning falcon in French — is spread across the two different versions of The Taming of the Shrew. It is in the form of the central figure who is tamed like a falcon, together with her name Emila; her father’s name, Baptista, and her husband’s name, Alphonso. An Emillius and a Bassianus appear in Titus Andronicus as well. But the most important “signatures” are those created after her husband’s death, between 1622-23, when her full maiden name — Aemilia Johnson Willough(by) Bassanio — was spread across three Shakespearean plays, associated in each case with the standard image of the Renaissance poet. Such a circumstance had little chance of being a mere coincidence. “She so badly wanted us to notice them,” says Hudson, “but nobody ever did.”Something revolutionaryThe next step for Hudson was to bring his case to the theater-going public. The first play he selected as a vehicle for his theory was A Midsummer Night’s Dream; with its staging he intended to present the allegorical plot revealing the key subtextual layers indicative of Bassano’s Jewish authorship. The challenge was to find the right people to do the job and convince them that he was on to something revolutionary.Hudson is British, married to an American, and the couple often shuttles between London and New York. It was there, in the fall of 2006, that he set out to put together a theater group that had both the dramatic training and mental muscle to actualize his theories. After a few months, Hudson had on board Mahayana Landowne, a Yale Drama School-educated director. Next he enrolled in a “Shakespeare Boot Camp” workshop at the New Perspectives Theatre Company, where he befriended Jenny Greeman, an experienced actress and theater educator who was to become his assistant director. “I found his theory compelling,” said Greeman, “and the figure of Amelia Bassano is absolutely fascinating…. She is someone who needs to be spoken about much more. I am thoroughly ready to believe that she could have written these plays….”Translating Hudson’s esoteric theory into concepts and then into practice involved hours of improvisation between actors, directors, and dramaturge (Hudson’s official title). “I was happy to adopt a hands-off management style when it came to staging the plays and leave it to those who truly understood the physicality of the theater,” he said. Yet, when it came to selecting actors for his new troupe, The Dark Lady Players, he made a point of meeting extensively with each actor to ensure that they were willing to think about the plays allegorically and took a proactive role at the dramatic workshops.Lila Dupree, who played Theseus, feels that the DLP achieved a group dynamic unlike any she had experienced before. “It is definitely a struggle at times to condense things so that they will be visually clear and clean. With something this high-concept, you risk alienating the audience, so a lot of our process involves finding ways to break down that fourth wall, so to speak.”Dupree is one of about 15 actors in the troupe, representing an eclectic ‘melting pot’ of theatrical backgrounds. What they all share is Shakespearean training buttressed by a voracious appetite for intellectually rigorous work.The DLP is now testing its version of As You Like It in workshops. Also in the pipeline is Hudson’s biography of Amelia Bassano, as well as a documentary film deal. With all the exciting attention on the horizon, the troupe feels wholly committed to its mission of presenting new and thought-provoking interpretations of Shakespeare’s (or Bassano’s) plays. “We’ve learned a lot from our experience with Midsummer,” says Dupree, “and with As You Like It, we are ready to take it to the next level.”To order a DVD of the Dark Lady Players’ Midsummer Night’s Dream, e-mail Dark Lady Players .Daniela Amini is a New York-based freelance writer specializing in theater, opera, dance, and local news.Comedy as revengeIn staging Midsummer Night’s Dream, John Hudson’s objective was, first and foremost, to reveal the play as a Jewish satire rife with pointed references to Christian idolatry. In other words, “comedy as revenge.”John Hudson carried out a literary adventure and brought it to the stage.In his findings, each character is revealed to have a connection with a character in religious allegory, i.e., a “double” in the Roman/Christian world. Stanford University professor Patricia Parker had already shown that Puck carries the name of two devils, that Bottom represents Jesus (and, in the course of the play, undergoes a kind of “Passion”), and that Thisbe represents the Church. Hudson completed the puzzle to show that Oberon is the figure of Yahweh (God of the Jews), who is embroiled in the Jewish-Roman war against Titus Caesar (embodied by Titania) over the abduction of the true Jewish Messiah (the Iudean or ‘Indian’ boy); the “flower, love in idleness” (a pun on idolatry), represents the Gospels; and the end of the play is a Jewish apocalypse characterized by the distribution of dew — as in the Zohar.The Dark Lady Players debuted Midsummer Night’s Dream in March 2007 at the Abingdon Theatre Arts Complex near Times Square. The staging was never heavy-handed and there were some uproariously funny moments, punctuated by scenes of violent carnage and deep, spiritual pathos. The overall tone was of a promising marriage between strict comedy and strict tragedy.— DANIELA AMINIDark Lady eventsFrom the Dark Lady Players’ A Midsummer Night’s Dream: A Comic Jewish Satire, Kirsta Peterson, top, as Bottom/Pyramus and Megan McGrath, left, and Amanda Bruton as soldiers.

https://www.snopes.com/disney/parks/club33.asp	Questions About Disneyland’s Club 33, Answered	true	['club 33', ' disney lawsuits', ' disney parks', ' disney rumors', ' disneyland', ' theme parks']	http://www.disneytouristblog.com/	http://www.disneytouristblog.com/disneyland-bar-crawl-guide/	2007/08/27	Pin ItAlthough no alcohol is sold in Disneyland itself (except in Club 33), locations in Disney California Adventure, the Disney-owned hotels, and Downtown Disney serve alcohol. Here’s our guide to the best beer and mixed drinks available throughout Disneyland Resort.While it’s not as popular as Drinking Around the World at Epcot in Walt Disney World, leisurely afternoon spent exploring the various Disneyland Resort bars is a lot of fun. Plus, all of these bars are within a short walk of one another given Disneyland’s condensed footprint, so it’s easy to hit them all in one day.Some of the mixed drinks here might be off-menu at some locations, but they’re listed because the bartenders at the given location do a great job with these drinks. We try to give a couple suggestions for each location so that you don’t have to order a random drink off what I “lovingly” prefer to as the Generic DisneyParks® Drink Menu® .I loathe this menu of sugar-water and vibrantly color concoctions meant to appeal only to vacationers who don’t regularly drink. It is the epitome of what is wrong with the contemporary Disney theme parks: homogenization that has replaced unique experiences in the name of saving a few bucks because bean-counters either don’t understand the “Disney Difference,” or think most guests won’t notice, anyway. More importantly, if you’re someone who has the mental and physical fortitude to partake in a bar crawl, you will be largely unimpressed by these drinks. Plus, consuming more than a couple will make you sick to your stomach from an overdose of sugar.Because of this, we make recommendations that are either unique to each specific stop on our tour, or are drinks most bartenders at the locations in question know how to make. Order these, or order something else you enjoy that the bartender knows how to make. You order drinks off the Generic DisneyParks® Drink Menu® at your own peril.Obviously you should use your head when consuming alcohol. Eat a big early-lunch before you start, make sure to stay hydrated, and spread out your drinking. This is enough fun that it should be an all day event, so take your time. We recommend starting at around noon and concluding late in the evening.Every good bar crawl needs a good name, and we’re fresh out. Epcot has “Drinking Around the World,” which is a very solid name, but nothing spectacular for Disneyland sticks out like that. In lieu of something better, I’m going to call this the Disneyland Drinking Debauchery. Sounds a little more risque than it actually is, but I like alliterations.It’s scientifically proven that the best place to start the Disneyland Drinking Debauchery is in Disney California Adventure. Laugh if you want, but there is a very good reason for this: Disney California Adventure has some attractions that are enhanced with alcohol. Seriously, it’s like adding 3D to the Lion King. It started out great, but 3D really adds an element of “wow.”These alcohol-enhanced attractions are California Screamin’, Silly Symphony Swings, Goofy’s Sky School, and the Golden Zephyr. In other words, the stuff on Paradise Pier. “Science” is needed here because you need to consume the perfect amount of alcohol to enhance these experiences. Drink too little, and they’re the same as they normally are. Drink too much, and it’s Upchuck-City. Population: everyone in your general vicinity. Not a pretty picture. However, if you hit that slightly-buzzed sweet spot, these attractions are a lot more fun.Okay, let’s get started with the fun!Disney California AdventureCarthay Circle Lounge – Part of the all-new Buena Vista Street, Carthay Circle contains a restaurant and two lounges. The first lounge, 1901, is available only to “upgraded” Club 33 members.  The other lounge is where you’ll be stopping, and there’s no reason to be down about this if you’re not a Club 33 member (as is the case with 99.99999999999999999% of the population), because this lounge is spectacular.The decor is classy and elegant, and most importantly, the lounge has its own unique menu. There are several great options on this menu, with different types of custom ice (seriously) to boot! My personal favorite is the Carthay Manhattan. Sarah enjoys the Carthay Club Mojito. The Aviator Cocktail is a good, strong drink, too. Be careful when you step into Carthay Circle Lounge, as this could be the first and last stop on your Disneyland Debauchery Drinking tour. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, as the drinks here are seriously good.Al Fresco Tasting Terrace – This location can be difficult to find. It’s a secluded area upstairs from Wine Country Trattoria. If you can’t find the staircase leading here, ask a Cast Member. It’s easier to find than it used to be, since changing over from the Al Fresco Lounge to the Tasting Terrace. Now featuring more tasting plates and a robust drink menu, things have improved, as you can read in our Al Fresco Tasting Terrace Review .Moreover, the views from this terrace into Cars Land are phenomenal. Here, we recommend one of the cheaper wine flights or the Widmer Hefeweizen . This is a wine bar, so I’d caution against straying from wines and beers. We’ve never had a good mixed drink here. In fact, the Irish Coffee Sarah once ordered here was about the most disgusting thing I’ve ever tasted, and was nothing like a traditional Irish Coffee. Fortunately, Al Fresco Tasting Terrace has come a long way since then, and it’s now one of our favorite spots in DCA.Bayside Brews – Bayside Brews is located near the Silly Symphony Swings, Golden Zephyr, and Goofy’s Sky School. Unsurprisingly, it serves beer. Although it’s just a little stand (if we stopped at every little beer kiosk in DCA, you’d end up in the hospital–fear not, this is one of only two that we hit), it is notable because it serves good beer as compared to other beer stands in Disneyland. We recommend grabbing a Sierra Nevada Torpedo IPA or whatever the Karl Strauss seasonal beer happens to be. The Torpedo IPA is definitely your best bet, and possibly the best beer you can find at Disneyland Resort.We highly recommend grabbing your brew from Bayside Brews, and then heading over to the actual bayside, to the secluded seating area under Silly Symphony Swings. Enjoy your beer there in peace while looking out over the water, and then head upstairs for the ride of your life on the swings!Cove Bar – The next stop is Cove Bar. Ahh, Cove Bar. In the original version of this Drinking Guide that we published in 2012, we regaled readers with tales of Cove Bar and its glorious Lobster Nachos. Prior to that post, we never had to wait to be seated at Cove Bar, always walking up and having our choice of seats.Shortly after that post, Cove Bar exploded in popularity. Now, we aren’t taking credit for that…nor are we taking blame. Irrespective of the reason, Cove Bar exploded in popularity, and a contributing factor was undoubtedly viral images of Lobster Nachos and colorful drinks on Instagram and Pinterest.Cove Bar began drawing lines rivaling those of Radiator Springs Races. The Lobster Nacho Revolution had begun. Fortunately, in early 2016, Disney opened an expanded seating area for Cove Bar, and now the waits have been reduced to more manageable times on most days (10-20 minutes).The bartenders are usually very entertaining and fun at the Cove Bar, so sitting at the bar can also be a good time. This should be your second food stop of the day (you should’ve eaten lunch before commencing the Disneyland Drinking Debauchery) and there is one thing you should absolutely order here: the Lobster Nachos. As we wrote in our Cove Bar Review , the Lobster Nachos are “a zen-like experience that makes you feel like there are little angels massaging your taste buds and tickling your stomach…a religious experience.”These are the most expensive thing on the bar menu, but they are so, so delicious. My drink of choice here is the Zombie , which can be made a few different ways. The bartenders here usually make it a dark green color, but don’t be surprised if it’s light. It does have some fruit juices in it, but it also is heavy on the rum (light, dark, and 151).The Cove Bar also has around 10 beers on tap, so pick one of those if you’re not down with the undead concoction.***Intermission***During the intermission, enjoy the Golden Zephyr, Silly Symphony Swings, and, if your stomach can handle it, California Screamin’ and Goofy’s Sky School. Return to the Disneyland Drinking Debauchery after enjoying these attractions.***Intermission***The Karl Strauss Beer Truck – This beer truck tucked away in Pacific Wharf at Disney California Adventure is our second of two kiosk style stops. As the name suggests, this truck serves Karl Strauss beer. As Disneyland Resort, for some reason, is very lacking on good craft beers, we recommend making a stop here. This should not be read as an endorsement of Karl Strauss beer, but comparatively speaking, it is fairly good. Tower 10 IPA and Red Trolley Ale are both good, or go for the seasonal option. This is one step we’d recommend skipping if you want to drink less and/or don’t care for beer. Alternatively, you can also stop at the nearby Rita’s Baja Blenders, Cocina Cucamonga, or Lucky Fortune Cookie for different options.Flo’s V8 Cafe – The latest addition to our list is quite possibly the best stop of all. If you’ve paced things really slowly, you might be here around sunset. That’s the perfect time to drink at Flo’s! Grab a Racer 5 IPA and head back to the outdoor seating area at the back of the restaurant. Here, you have a perfect view of the Cadillac Mountain Range and Radiator Springs Racers. There’s nothing quite like an early evening enjoying a beer and watching the cars fly by one of Imagineering’s masterpieces. You might just find yourself ending your debauchery here, as you get “stuck” at this spot for a couple of hours. Make no mistake–even though you’re not missing the mission, this is a noble feat.On your way to the next stops at Disney’s Grand Californian Hotel & Spa, pick up FastPasses for (hopefully) the late show of World of Color.Grand CalifornianHearthstone Lounge – Hearthstone Lounge has a pretty good selection of beers, with a lot of the standard choices available elsewhere from Karl Strauss and Sierra Nevada. You can also find some choices from Sam Adams and New Castle, among others, here. Here, we definitely recommend sitting at the bar or at least ordering from the bar. We’ve had inexperienced servers here in the general seating area who simply recommend “any of the good drinks on the menu” with the menu being the Generic DisneyParks® Drink Menu®. I typically opt for a Sierra Nevada here, whereas Sarah usually experiments with whatever “bartender’s choice.” These drinks have always tasted great, but beware, they can pack a punch!Napa Rose – Napa Rose is the best non-club restaurant at Disneyland Resort . It also has a pretty nice bar. Luckily, you don’t have to drop $50 on some filet to grab a beer here (although if you see or smell one, you might find yourself doing just that). I recommend the Franziskaner Hefe-Weisses here. It’s creamy and moderately thick, with a nutty flavor and slight banana undertone to it. Napa Rose is more well known for its world class wine collection, so if you’re into wine, you might go that route. Rather than taking my advice on that, ask the bartender or a server. All of the servers here are sommeliers, meaning they know a heck of a lot more about wine than me!Here, the plan offers some wild-card options. See the below “Other Stops” section if you have time in your crawl and want to make an additional stop.Hollywood Land Dance Party [Insert Name] Club – There is a drink station set-up each night for Mad T Party. It was previously End of Line Club, now it’s “Drink Me.” Who knows what it will be next. Regardless of the name, the idea remains the same: pricey light up drinks for clubin’. While the drinks are fairly expensive (over $10 for the light-up specialties) here to capitalize on the party-oriented audience, ours have always been surprisingly good. This is surprising because, given the location and target, we figured these would be watered-down sugar-drinks. The Glowjito Mojito and Digitini Martini are both good and offer light-up fun. To be fair, they are somewhat sugar-y, but the ones we’ve had (on several different nights) have always had some kick. I don’t know if this is just great luck or if it’s always this way. After grabbing a drink, join the other programs…or…tweedle dums(?) at elecTRONica or Mad T Party . Once the dance party concludes, use your FastPass for the late show of World of Color.Trader Sam’s – Enchanted Tiki Bar – After World of Color, the perfect way to cap off the evening is at the best bar in all of Disneyland Resort, Trader Sam’s. If you want a thorough review of Trader Sam’s, read this review where I offer heaping amounts of praise to Trader Sam’s . The CliffNotes version: Trader Sam’s is the coolest bar in Disneyland, with an intimate (47 person capacity) location that is packed with an astonishing amount of detail, interactive elements, and some fantastic drinks.Some of these drinks include the Adventurers Club Kungaloosh (a Walt Disney World classic), the HippopotoMai-Tai, Shrunken Zombie Head, Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Rum, Shipwreck on the Rocks, and the Uh Oa! The Uh Oa! can be shared by 2-4 people, has a cool tableside presentation, and is our favorite drink at Trader Sam’s. Trader Sam’s does serve some good beers as well, but this is one location where you should stick to mixed drinks because they’re really that good. If you stay for only one drink, you can add items in from the “Other Stops” list below, but we recommend spending a couple hours here soaking up the ambiance and ending your night here. It’s the perfect conclusion to Disneyland Drinking Debauchery.Other Stops – There are other places you can stop, but chances are, even with taking it slow and spreading out the festivities over the course of the entire day, eight stops will be the limit (or even too much) for most people. The stops above are our picks for the best drinking spots in Disneyland. However, since we heavily weigh ambiance, there might be some additional or alternative places that might appeal more to you personally, depending upon your preferences. Here’s our list of the best of the rest:	1.0
https://www.snopes.com/did-a-new-jersey-town-forbid-residents-from-criticizing-islam/	Did a New Jersey Town Forbid Residents From Criticizing Islam?	mfalse	['islamophobia', ' mosque', ' new jersey', ' sharia']	http://americannews.com/	http://americannews.com/us-town-forbids-citizens-criticizing-islam-muslims-residents-furious/	2017/08/08	ago 10According to reports from World Net Daily, a New Jersey township that was sued by a group of Muslims for refusing to approve a massive mosque project is now returning to court because of a settlement agreement that restricts anyone from commenting on “Islam” or “Muslims.”It’s important to note that a key tenet of Shariah bans any negative comments about the religion. According to the Thomas More Law Center who sued the township on behalf of two residents whose home is within 200 feet of the proposed mega-mosque, the settlement “reads more like an instrument of surrender.”The Islamic Society of Basking Ridge won a decision in federal court after its mosque proposal was rejected based on traffic and other concerns. The Township agreed on a $3.5. million payment and a “public hearing to approve the settlement.”Residents Christopher and Loretta Quick challenged the agreement, arguing it restricts speech and violates the Establishment Clause.“The Quicks reside within 200 feet of the proposed mosque construction in a zoned residential area,” Thomas More explained. “Yet, the settlement agreement prohibits them from describing the many unique features of Islamic worship which will impact the design of the building, traffic density, water and sewage, traffic control problems, road construction, and parking arrangements. According to the settlement agreement, ISBR is permitted to make statements concerning Christians and Jews and their places of worship, but in contrast, the agreement prohibits commentary relating to Islam or Muslims. In fact, ISBR has previously discussed the Christian and Jewish religions and their places of worship.”Richard Thompson, chief counsel for Thomas More, said the Islamic center “has taken the extraordinary step of concealing significant links on their website to a radical group named by the federal government as an unindicted co-conspirator in the largest terrorism financing trial in America history, the Islamic Society of North America (‘ISNA’).”Thompson said that while “claiming that the township had a religious animus against Muslims, ISBR hid from the public view its animus toward Christians and Jews, by not only hiding anti-Christian and anti-Semitic verses published on its website but also hiding its significant ties to ISNA. Instead of standing up to defend its citizens against ISBR’s hate-filled anti-Semitic and anti-Christian bias, the township colluded with ISBR’s ‘Civilization Jihad’ by capitulating to payment of millions of dollars to ISBR, allowing the construction of the new mosque and Islamic center in violation“ISBR is setting a dangerous unconstitutional precedent by abusing a court process to chill and trample on the First Amendment rights of private citizens whose only involvement was to speak out against the mosque at public hearings,” Thompson said earlier this year.He asked for the subpoenas to be thrown out “because the U.S. Supreme Court has held that speech at a public place on a matter of public concern is entitled to special protection.”0	1.0
https://www.snopes.com/newsweek-report-trump-impeachment/	Did Newsweek Report That Trump Will Be Impeached and Replaced by Hillary Clinton?	false	['2016 presidential election', ' donald trump', ' hillary clinton']	http://www.newsweek.com/	http://www.newsweek.com/hillary-clinton-president-lawrence-lessig-post-686077	2018/01/23	"On 10/16/17 at 4:00 PMYes, we're (still) rehashing the 2016 election. Timothy A. Clary/AFP/GettyShareUpdated | Sure, it's been more than 340 days since Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton, but there's still one very narrow, highly unlikely and entirely unprecedented way that Clinton could become president.But you never know...In light of the ongoing probe into Russia collusion, Harvard University professor Lawrence Lessig posted on  Medium  a series of ""if/then"" scenarios that would lead to House Speaker Paul Ryan handing the White House keys to Clinton.Related: Hillary Clinton losing to Trump was like Jesus's crucifixionTo be clear, constitutional law expert Lessig is not calling for a Clinton ascendancy, but was merely playing out a hypothetical chain of events should a conspiracy be proven:If number 1: If Trump is definitively found to have colluded directly with Russia, he would be forced to resign or be impeached.If number 2: If Trump is removed, Vice President Mike Pence would become president.If number 3: If Pence becomes president, he should resign too, given that he benefited from the same help from Mother Russia.If number 4: If Pence resigns before appointing a vice president, Ryan would become president.If number 5: If Ryan becomes president, he should do the right thing  and choose Clinton for vice president. Then he should resign.""The answer seems unavoidable: He should nominate the person defeated by the treason of his own party, and then step aside and let her become the president,"" Lessig writes. ""Without doubt, if Ryan did the right thing, that would be the most extraordinary event in the history of America since the Confederate Army fired on Fort Sumter. But unlike that, this event would build the union, not divide it.""Lessig, who briefly ran for the Democratic nomination in 2015, adds that Clinton would then appoint Ryan to be veep out of political goodwill. Americans can only assume that while busy being a president who can read policy documents longer than one page , she'd stop her endless press tour and figure out how to keep the nation from getting nuked.Lessig apparently isn't the only one with Clinton on the brain. Clinton has made it clear she won't run for office again, telling CBS Sunday Morning that she's ""done with being a candidate."" But Trump himself tweeted about the possibility Monday.""I was recently asked if Crooked Hillary Clinton is going to run in 2020?"" he wrote . ""My answer was, 'I hope so!'""Only time will tell if the Russia cloud clears up by then.Story was updated to clarify that Lessig was not advocating for the ""if/then"" scenario, but merely laying it out."	1.0

The bodies and money trace back to an armored car robbery in Southeast New Mexico. He had the unit on an autopay contract but his credit card expired and due to a juxtoposed number…he never got the notice in the mail.”According to his secretary, John Lewis Prager, he first he heard of it was when it came over the police scanner in the Mayor’s office. “He suddenly had to go,” said Prager, visibly upset, “It’s the last time I’ve seen or heard from him. I’m guessing he knew what was about to happen and went to some other evil storage locker to cash out and escape.”The FBI thinks Prager is right. Foreman reportedly has more than a dozen storage units spread across Missouri and possibly hundreds around the country. He was spotted on surveillance cameras in Hamilton leaving a unit with a bag from an armored car:A bag that size could contain millions in $100 bills or bearer bonds. The FBI also suspects that Foreman has fake passports and various pre-planned escape routes. “Finding him won’t be easy,” said Slurryman, “but we won’t stop until we do.”The mayor’s job in Goose Rapids will revert to Foreman’s Deputy Mayor.	1.0
https://www.snopes.com/white-house-comment-shutdown/	Did President Trump Shut Down the White House Phone-In Comment Line?	mfalse	['barack obama', ' donald trump', ' white house']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/sN88i	2017/01/24	on January 23, 2017 4:56 pm·In another attempt to stifle freedom of expression, President Trump and his administration have dismantled the White House switchboard comment operating system. Instead, callers will be told to take their complaints and comments to Facebook and other White House social media platforms.When called, the White House switchboard states:“Thank you for calling the White House comments line. The comment line is currently closed but your comment is important to the President and we urge you to send us a comment online at www.WhiteHouse.gov/contact or send us a message through Facebook messenger.”Trump really is becoming the social-media president.Since the end of the transition, when the lines were apparently shut off, the Trump administration has been purging the White House website off all things that generally resemble the Obama White House — and thus anything that has to do with equality and inclusion. So this is just another instance of curtailing the openness of the people’s house.It seems that the 15 percent of American households without internet will not be able to have Trump hear their concerns, who promised to be a champion of all people and listen to their needs.There is no indication yet from the White House whether this is permanent or temporary, as the incoming administration settles into their positions.Still, there was no downtime for this crucial line of democracy when the Obama administration took over in 2009.Given the Trump administration’s penchant for lying and ignoring the people, this should come as no surprise. However, it should worry the public if no future action is taken to address this. The people’s house should be readily available at all times, in all fashions.It’s only day three, and Donald Trump and his team are showing a brazen disregard for the little things that make us great. When studying authoritarians, one must look at how the littlest of things change before their eyes.This might be one of them — a White House that doesn’t want to be bombarded with calls from an outraged public.Featured image by Ron Sachs via Getty ImagesShare this Article!	1.0
http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/aug/19/united-care/medical-grade-marijuana-wont-get-you-high-cannabis/	"""Medical-grade marijuana alone will not get that patient ‘high,’ no matter what level of THC, CBD or any other compound is found in the plant."""	mfalse	['Marijuana', 'Public Health']	http://www.sfltimes.com/	http://www.sfltimes.com/news/politics/local-politics/amendment-2-supports-healthcare	2016/08/19	Staff Report — August 11, 2016By KIM MCCRAYOur Health Matters. And when you vote for Amendment 2, not only are you voting for a medication that is proven to help people with cancer, HIV & AIDS, glaucoma, PTSD, MS and more, but you’re also voting for positive change in the community.Now, the opponents of Amendment 2 have taken on a tone similar to Donald Trump…instilling fear through saturating the media with misinformation. For example, the opponents to this amendment have touted that states like Colorado (who successfully passed a similar bill) have experienced a higher use of marijuana among 10th graders.But if you look at studies from noteworthy organizations such as the International Journal of Drug Policy, Colorado Department of Public Safety and Lancet Psychiatry to see the difference between adolescent use before and after passing a medical marijuana law, the level of misuse for that demographic went down. Therefore I would strongly encourage you not to get caught up by those types of scare tactics while considering the many benefits that passing this bill will bring to people you deeply care about.What is also important to know is that although some debilitated patients may require higher levels of THC than others based on their specific medical condition, medical-grade marijuana alone, will not get that patient“high,” no matter what level of THC, CBD or any other compound is found in the plant. And unlike the rumors floating around, medical-grade marijuana does not have to be smoked to be effective. It also comes in various other forms such as an ointment, oil, pill and skin patch.I’m reminded of Bridgette Wilkie from Orlando. Bridgette is a mother, wife and entrepreneur. She suffers from sickle cell anemia and lives with chronic pain that most people cannot imagine. Bridgette is taking “elephant doses” of Oxycontin and Oxycodone and still, there are days when she cannot get out of bed to see her daughter off to school because the pain is just too unbearable.The narcotics that are prescribed for Bridgette have terrible side effects on her organs that make her overall condition worse.It would be great if she could have access to other effective and safer alternative treatments like medical-grade marijuana, without making her high. Doctors should not be restricted from utilizing other safer and well-proven treatment methods when patients like Bridgette have such painful reactions to the narcotics typically prescribed for people in her condition.As you may know, current state regulations in Florida do not necessarily prevent doctors from prescribing (or over-prescribing) other drugs such as Morphine, Xanax, Oxycontin and other potentially deadly medications that are much more likely to be habit-forming. By supporting Amendment 2, you will help to ensure the right level of oversight in how medical-grade marijuana will be prescribed and distributed. In fact, one of the key provisions of this amendment is that only licensed physicians can recommend medical-grade marijuana and will be held accountable if they are found to be negligent.Think about the people in your life, your church or community who will begin to finally find comfort and relief when Amendment 2 passes. Furthermore,history shows that when a state enacts a medical marijuana law, first-time (and ongoing) use among teens in that state goes down.So when we go to the ballot box, we need to vote “YES” to prevent Florida politics from over-reaching at the expense of people like Bridgette (or our veterans, cancer patients, those suffering from AIDS and others) who could benefit greatly from a safer, more effective and more controlled medical alternative.Kim McCray is the Outreach Director for United For Care.

We sit here in the great battleground state of Ohio. 63 days to go. How badly do you need to win Ohio to win that White House?TRUMP: Well we’re up in Ohio and you see the kind of crowds we’re having in Ohio and I think we’re going to win it and certainly I think it will be very important to win Ohio. We’re going to do very well in Pennsylvania. We’re leading in Florida. We’re doing well pretty much all over but winning Ohio. First of all, I worked here for a long period of time and I loved this state and I love the people and I think we’re going to win Ohio.MUIR: You’ve heard what people have said. Republicans do not win the White House without Ohio.TRUMP: Well I’ve heard that and certainly we intend to win Ohio. We should win Ohio.MUIR: Twenty days until the first big debate. Are you ready?TRUMP: You never know, but I think so.MUIR: Are you prepping?TRUMP: Yeah sure. I’m prepping, maybe not in the traditional way. When I had the debates, I had 11 debates with the -- as you know -- in the primaries, and I was very satisfied. Everybody else was very satisfied with the way I did. And I think I’m working the same way I did there.MUIR: But this will be a lot different. I mean there will be two candidates on that stage. It won’t be, you know, the list that was there during the primary.TRUMP: Well we started off with 17 and in the end we had just a few left so, it’s not that much different. But I look forward to the debates. I think it’s gonna be very revealing.MUIR: Any mock debates?TRUMP: Haven’t thought about it much. It could happen. But haven’t really given it much thought.MUIR: I read somewhere that when you were asked about the debate. You were asked about the debates and you said, ‘I know how to handle Hillary.’TRUMP: I don’t think I’d ever say that about anybody. I don’t know how to handle you. I don’t know how to handle anybody. I’m me. I just do what I have to do. And what we’re going to be doing -- and you see it from outside when you look at those Ohio crowds we have 60 or 70,000 people right outside the door. That’s, nobody’s ever had that and what I know how to do is create jobs and that’s what I'm going to do.I’m bringing jobs back to Ohio and Pennsylvania and all of the states and they know my stance on immigration and it’s the proper stance. But we’re going to bring jobs back. We’re gonna give jobs back in these states because we are being drained, our country’s being drained of its jobs. And we can’t have that. I see people today, they want hope, they’re desperate, they’re desperate. We had 15,000 people working in a factory and now they’re down to 500 people. From 15,000 they’re down to 500 and the jobs have all left and the companies have gone to Mexico and other places. We’re not going to stand for that.MUIR: We couldn’t help but to notice that the Trump Pence plane is at the airport and so is Hillary Clinton’s new plane. Does that signal to you that it’s game on?PENCE: Well I think it’s been game on with Donald Trump since the very beginning and that’s the reason why everyday he’s been winning more hearts and minds all across this country with a simple message that we can make America great again. I mean you saw thousands of people out at this county fair today. And they’re responding to a strong leader but even beyond that he’d be the first to say this is a movement of people that know that the leadership of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton has weakened America’s place in the world, stifled America’s economy and Donald Trump has the qualities of leadership and he has the vision to strengthen America at home and abroad.MUIR: Let me ask you Mr. Trump you just traveled to Mexico and you said shortly after that you and the Mexican president did not discuss who would pay for the wall. And then afterward the president of Mexico said it was discussed and that he said Mexico will not pay for it. Hillary Clinton, who’s also here in Ohio, as you know, told us a short time ago that you choked, that the idea of Mexico paying for this wall has been central to your campaign. Did you choke?TRUMP: So let me just tell you about choking. I don’t choke. She chokes. Look at the deals she’s made. She’s responsible for so many bad things that have happened to our country including the signing by her husband of NAFTA, which has drained our country of its jobs. I’ve been given A plus, including by you people, but I’ve been given A pluses for the job I did in Mexico. All that is is a Madison Avenue soundbite. Whether I did phenomenally or not they would have said that. That was a tremendous success for me. You know that virtually everybody including my biggest critics have said that when I went down to Mexico it was a tremendous success. Mike called me and said, ‘I’ve never seen anybody look so presidential.’ Many people have said that.PENCE: It’s true.TRUMP: And the fact is Mexico will pay for the wall, it was discussed that it wouldn't be discussed but they know my stance and I know their stance. And until I’m president I’m not going to press anything very much, but they fully know my stance. My stance is we’re going to build a wall and Mexico’s going to pay for the wall. It’s very simple.MUIR: Did the Mexican president break his word in talking about it?TRUMP: They all know the ground rules and the ground rules were there. Rudy Giuliani said it, in fact Rudy was surprised. Rudy Giuliani spoke very eloquently about it. The ground rules. And we had ground rules and that’s OK. They know my stance and I know their stance. See who wins in the end. We’ll win, 100 percent, they’re going to pay for the wall.We’re going to build a wall, they’re going to pay for the wall, we’re going to keep drugs out, we’re going to keep the people that-- we have gangs, we have gang leaders. We have drug kings. We have all of these people flowing into our country, all of those people are going to get out. We’re gonna get ‘em out. We’re gonna stop the flow of drugs into our country.Our country is being poisoned. Our youth are being destroyed. We have cities over the weekend 20 people are overdosed on drugs. Twenty people from one city and dying. They’re dying all over our country and it’s coming, mostly, from that section of the world. We’re gonna stop it.PENCE: Other than Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine, Donald Trump’s visit to Mexico City was universally praised. You remember that Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine have basically tried to paint a picture of Donald Trump that, just because you’re a strong leader at home and you have a strong vision about America’s place in the world that you don’t have the ability to sit down in a diplomatic setting and build relationships with world leaders. Last Wednesday what the American people saw, and frankly, what the world saw, was a gracious man who will represent America great on a world stage, but also will do it in a way that will command the respect of the world.MUIR: Governor, you know what the Clinton team will say though. That Mr. Trump is talking often about Mexico paying for that wall and that this campaign returned with Mexico saying, ‘we’re not paying for it.’PENCE: You know what you have in Donald Trump is not-TRUMP: Oh, he didn’t say that. He tweeted that long after the meeting was over. He didn’t say that.MUIR: You tweet a lot too though.TRUMP: I doMUIR: And we take you at your word.TRUMP: You have 25 million people with Facebook, why wouldn’t I take advantage of something. But the fact is he didn’t say that, he tweeted that after I left and then in the speech I made in Arizona -- which was also a really respected speech on immigration -- I said, ‘And by the way, Mexico will pay for the wall.’ I also said they might not even know it yet. But Mexico will pay for the wall, 100 percent and it’s easy because they’re making so much money. They’re taking our jobs. Drugs are pouring across the border. They make a fortune off the United States. Both at the border and with jobs.And I like them very much, I get along very well with the president. Very, very well. I think we’ll have a very good relationship, but Mexico will pay for the wall.MUIR: You talk about the speech. The central premise of the speech was immigration and let me just ask you about what one of your top surrogates, in the last 24 hours, Rudy Giuliani said that Donald Trump would ‘find it very difficult to throw a family that's been here in the United States for 15 years with kids who are now American citizens out of this country.’ That that’s not the America that Donald Trump wants. So will some of these families be allowed to stay?TRUMP: First of all he’s 100 percent right. It’s very difficult. It’s a very difficult thing to do. Here’s what we’re going to do. It’s very simple. It was put out in the speech and most people understood it but the crowd -- we had 15,000 people and they’re going wild and a lot of people I guess didn’t hear it or they just were watching the reaction. What we’re going to do is we’re going to build a tremendously strong and powerful boarder. People are going to come in, but they’re going to come in legally. We’re going to get rid of all of the bads: the gang members, the drug lords and all of the different people that are here and that shouldn’t be here. We’re gonna clean things up.Once we have a secure border -- totally secure -- we’re going to take a look at the people that you’re talking about. We're going to look at it from where our country is, from where we stand in the world, from how we’re doing as a country. We’re going to take a very good, strong, hard look at the people that remained.MUIR: When you take a good, strong hard look, does that mean some of those 11 million undocumented immigrants will be allowed to stay?TRUMP: It could be, but what’s going to happen is, if you’re going to be a citizen, you’re going to leave and you're going to have to come back. We’re going to do something -- you know we have thousands and thousands of people waiting on line. It’s very, very unfair to put people ahead of the line. We have right now thousands -- they’ve been waiting ten years, David, to come into the country. It’s very unfair to take people and have them circumvent the line. We’re going to speed up the line because I want people to come into the country, but they have to do it through a legal process. Tthey have to do it legallyPENCE: David, what you’re hearing here is--MUIR: But people want to know the answer to this question. Those who are here who are undocumented who did not break the law, who are coming--TRUMP: Well they broke the law in coming into the country.MUIR: Right.TRUMP: Is that a correct statement?MUIR: If they want to be a citizen, they will have to go home?TRUMP: If they want to be a citizen, they have to go home, get on line. Now, the line will be much more efficient. Like everything with this government, the line is a disaster right now. People are waiting for many many years and people are-- the only people that come into this country are the people that pour in. They just pour in. and many of these people are now member of the gangs and they’re now selling drugs all over the country.A lot of people are on line. It’s very unfair to have them waiting for four years, for six years, for ten years and other people just walk into the country. We can’t do that, but we’re gonna have a very efficient process because we want people to come into the country. They have to go through the system.PENCE: David, what Donald Trump is calling for is a fundamental reform of our immigration system. In that speech in Arizona, he said that if people want to achieve citizenship, they have to go back in line, they have to leave the country but they won’t be operating under the same visa caps of the past.We’re gonna be working with the Congress a new commission that our new president will establish to revise and reform our immigration laws, but all with the load star on what’s in the best interest of the American people now and going forward. That, to me, was the most refreshing part of Donald Trump’s messageTRUMP: And at the time, because you're talking about building a wall, securing our border, getting all of the criminals out -- because we have perhaps millions of people who have records, criminals. We’re going to end sanctuary cities where they see people are protected. They’re swaddled, they’re protected. We can’t do that anymore. I look at the families who have been destroyed by illegal immigrants killing their daughters, their sons, their husband, their wives. We’re not gonna have that any more, David. We’re not going to have that. So we will see, at the end of the process, where we are as a country and what we'll do.MUIR: So when those families do ultimately go home, the ones who have no record who are here, once you get the wall and the criminals out of here, as you say. Is it self-deportation?TRUMP: No.MUIR: Or will you deport them?TRUMP: No.MURI: How does it work?TRUMP: They will-- If they want to become a citizen, they’ll go out and they’ll come back in through a process, but they have to get on line,MUIR: But what is that called? I mean, most people call it--TRUMP: They don’t call it anythingMUIR: Will they have to go--TRUMP: They don’t call it anything, OK? They don’t call it anything. They will get on line, they’ll go behind people that have been waiting for four, five years. By that time the line, I’m sure, will be much more efficient because we do things efficiently -- right now it’s a bureaucratic mess. It’s a total mess. You know a lot of people don’t come in legally because of the fact that people are just pouring across the border. That’s the way they come into the country, right. So they will get on line and they will come in through an efficient process if they want to become a citizen.MUIR: And if they don’t want to become a citizen?TRUMP: They have to make a determination what happens when the border is secureMUIR: So you’re open to them staying here undocumented?TRUMP: I’m going to make a decision, or somebody will. Whether it’s me or somebody else because, perhaps, depending on the time -- by that time we’ll have a secure border, we’ll have a wall. We will have stopped the drugs pouring into the country. I mean, you look at states like Ohio you look at states like Pennsylvania or New Hampshire, the biggest thing on their minds is drugs. I say, ‘What’s your biggest problem?’ It’s jobs and it’s drugs. We’re gonna stop the drugs and we’re gonna bring jobs back to our states. We’re going to bring jobs back to our country.PENCE: And Donald Trump has laid out a plan to end illegal immigration once and for all, which has a direct relationship to the struggling economy that we face. The fact is that, here in Ohio and all over the country, illegal immigration now, for more than a generation, has cost Americans jobs, it has suppressed wages and it’s had all the other affects that he’s talked about so clearly and openly across the country.I think what the American people are seeing is a leader that knows how to put first things first. Whether it be in a meeting in Mexico City with the president where they focused on first building a relationship, talking about the five things they agreed on: ending illegal immigration, human trafficking, ending the flow of illicit drugs and other issues. And also in this area, what people heard from Arizona last week was Donald Trump saying we’re going to put border security and internal enforcement and removing criminal aliens and those who have overstayed their visas, we’re going to deal with all of that, and for those that remain we’ll have that discussion in the future.TRUMP: David, we have to stop the illegal flow of drugs into our country. Our country is a disaster, our youth is being poisoned, and I’m not talking about small numbers, I’m talking about massive numbers of young people whose lives are going to be destroyed and are destroyed in many cases because they’re hooked and they can’t get off it. Heroin, in particular, is so hard to get off, they’re hooked.We are going to stop the illegal flow of drugs and, as you know, 16,500 border patrol agents endorsed me. They know better than anybody what’s happening. They endorsed me. I said to them, ‘How important is the wall?’ They said, ‘Mr. Trump, it is absolutely imperative, especially for the stopping of the drugs that are pouring in.’MUIR: I do want to ask one more question on something you said a moment ago about people who are undocumented. You are open to the possibility that ultimately they might simply stay?TRUMP: We’re going to make that determination at the time. Once we have a secure border and we stop the drugs and stop the bad ones and get the bad ones out, those are going to be gone immediately. Day one, first hour, I”m going to give a mandate to everybody, including the local police because they know. You know the local police know every one of the bad ones, it’s not like, ‘Oh gee, let’s figure out who it is.’ They know every bad gang member, drug kingpin, they know all of them. As soon as I will be in office for one hour and that order will go out. We’re getting them the hell out of the country.PENCE: But David, let me also say it’s very appropriate to have lots of interest in what a President Donald Trump will do on illegal immigration. Donald Trump put the issue of illegal immigration at the center of the national debate. But what I’d also like to see, and I think millions of Americans would like to see, is more clarity about HIllary Clinton’s plan.Hillary Clinton is presumably for open borders. She intends to impose the unconstitutional executive amnesty that the supreme court rejected. I mean, she actually wants to increase the Syrian refugee program by 550 percent. I think as much attention that’s being paid to my running mate and our position on illegal immigration, the American people deserve to know that Hillary Clinton will advocate the policies of amnesty that the American people want to reject and it will continue the flow of illegal immigration that’s costing jobs in this country and too often resulting in tragedy.MUIR: And when it comes to Syrian refugees you still--TRUMP: Over.MUIR: Done, right now?TRUMP: Done. No more. Done. We have no idea who they are, we have no idea are they ISIS-related, we have absolutely no clue. And you see what happens with just one person. You take a look, all over the world, not just here, not just San Bernadino or Orlando, or any of the other places. You take a look at what one person does, the destruction that one person can do. And it is interesting with Hillary Clinton she wants to let the Syrian refugees, or whoever they are, pour into our country. We don’t even know where they’re putting them. You know the governors of states don’t even know who’s coming into their own states.MUIR: Have you met any of the Syrian refugees who live here now already in communities in California, Idaho?PENCE: David, that’s really not the issue. The issue is that we live in such uncertain times and what Donald Trump has put at the center of the national debate is there simply are countries, and even territories of the world, that are so torn asunder by civil war and so compromised by terrorism that our own homeland security and FBI director said we can’t know who these people are. So the only thing that a president of the United States should do is to suspend that program immediately, put the safety and security of the American people first and initiate safe zones in the region for those that are fleeing from those war torn areas.But secondly, Donald Trump is also calling for an extreme vetting to ensure that people who are coming into this country don’t represent a threat to ourselves and our families.TRUMP: Extreme vetting. Let me tell you, Hillary Clinton doesn’t talk about illegal immigration. It’s a very complex subject and it’s a subject that a lot of people don’t like to get into, even though everyone knows it’s a tremendous, massive problem and basically her definition of illegal immigrant is: come on in, folks, welcome to the country. She doesn’t get who they are, where they come from, what their record is. If they’re killers they’re killers. Doesn't make any difference to her. It’s open borders, it’s take everybody’s jobs, and it’s a disaster.And nobody can tell me that’s a popular thing, nobody can tell me it’s the right thing because it’s not the right thing. And you ever notice -- you’re talking to us about illegal immigration, which is fine with me -- but do you ever notice she never talks about it? She never brings it up. Because basically it’s an open border policy where people are going to flow into our country.MUIR: Let me ask you about something you said recently. You said that you have regretted moments along the way to your candidacy where your words have caused personal pain. And I’m curious, who are you talking about?TRUMP: Anybody.MUIR: Can you just give us one example?TRUMP: No, it’s no specifics, just anybody. Look--MUIR: Your campaign--TRUMP: I went through, David, I went through 16 people, we had 17. It was a very harsh, very harsh primary. People say the most in history. The most number of people, but it was the harshest in history. I was rough, they were rough on me, but you know a lot of feelings were hurt, some still, even though they signed a pledge. They haven’t been able to endorse me because they haven’t gotten over what took place. Number one, they lost, and number two, it was a tough primary.MUIR: So you were primarily talking about the other candidates?TRUMP: I’m talking about anybody that was offended or hurt. It’s OK. Now I have to go into the future, but I said that. And I mean it. I don’t want to hurt anybody, I don’t want to offend anybody. But if anybody was hurt. But, if you just look at the 16 people that I-- we had a total of 17 and I’m last standing.And now you see what’s happening with Hillary. You see what’s going on with her emails. It’s a disgrace. It’s a disgusting situation where she pretends like she doesn’t know. I mean, she had her emails -- 33,000 emails -- acid washed. The most sophisticated person never heard about acid washing. Acid washing is a very expensive process and that’s to really get rid of them. Really, and these emails pertain to her wedding or her yoga classes? What’s gone on here is very serious, and I’ll be honest, I think that the FBI is having a very, very hard time. I don’t think they’ve ever been through a period where so many people are so disappointed in them.MUIR: Do you think the FBI failed on this?TRUMP: It’s not a question of thinking. You know what-- you cover it every night. What she did is a series of lies, gross negligence, carelessness. I mean, your document said carelessness. This is worse, this is gross negligence. They put a young man in prison, or they’re going to put him in prison, because he used the wrong Xerox machine on something. What’s going on is horrible.MUIR: So when the director recommended no criminal charges--TRUMP: I was shocked. Especially after he read, for a fairly long period of time, just a few of the many things that she did that were illegal.MUIR: So is that a failure of the FBI?TRUMP: Well it’s certainly not a moment to be proud of, I can tell you that. I can tell you that I have so many people, both legal experts and civilians, regular people that cannot believe-- you see it outside. You see the people outside, how angry.Now I just heard that we have close to 100,000 people standing outside. They’re all for Trump. We’re in Ohio. They’re all for Trump. And you see the Hillary signs with bars on them. Look what she did is illegal. Now were the laws wrong, maybe they’re very tough, but a lot of people’s lives were ruined for doing two percent of what she did. Two percent.You look at General Petraeus. You look at this young person whose mother is absolutely devastated because they’re going to put her son in prison and what he did is nothing compared to what she did. It’s a horrible thing. It’s a horrible, horrible thing. And our country is not very proud right now, I can tell you.MUIR: Governor Pence, you’re making news this week in revealing that you’ll release your tax returns.PENCE: Sure. Will be a pretty quick read.MUIR: Pretty quick read. I’m curious, do you think the American voter has the right to see the tax returns of Donald Trump before they vote on election day?PENCE: You know I’m very pleased to provide our tax returns. You’re going to find out my family’s a middle class family and that there will be pretty clear evidence that we haven’t profited from our 16 years in and around public life.MUIR: Governor, I’m asking about Donald Trump and every presidential candidate going back four years--PENCE: Look I’m releasing my tax returns. Donald Trump will release his tax returns. I’ll give mine to y’all this week and he’s going to provide his after a routine audit is done.But it’s important for your viewers to know that both of us have filed what the law requires in the form of financial disclosure statements and I have to tell you, Donald Trump filed over a 100 pages of personal financial information. People have an opportunity to review that. But I do think an awful lot of this is a bit of a distraction. I actually was asked over the weekend on another network, making some comparison between the fact that Hillary Clinton made efforts to delete 17,500 emails and refused to turn those over to the FBI and authorities, with whether or not we had, in fact, yet released our tax returns. I just think that’s an absurd comparison, to say the least.Both of us believe in the the public’s right to know. We’ve both been transparent, as the laws require and will continue to be. But the simple fact is that Hillary Clinton needs to step forward. Donald Trump has had more press conferences in Mexico this year than Hillary Clinton has in the United States. It's time for her to come forward, start answering questions, start coming clean about what was nothing short of a pay-to-play program when major foreign donors were able to give millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation. And now we know from these emails -- that she refused to turn over, that now have come to light -- that those individuals were given access, and who knows what else, at the state department while she was secretary of state.MUIR: Let me ask you, Governor, because you said something a moment ago You think the talk about Donald Trump and his taxes, and whether or not he’ll release his returns before Election Day, you think that's a distraction?PENCE: I think-- I have never seen, in my lifetime in and around politics, the level of media attacks on a public figure, the likes of which I’ve seen on my running mate.MUIR: I guess I’m asking-- you think people ought to have the right to see--PENCE: You have a level of dishonesty, you have a level of dishonesty in the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton, while she was secretary of state, the likes of which the American people have never seen. The FBI released their notes from their interview on a Friday afternoon before Labor Day weekend. But fortunately, still the press covered it very thoroughly. And we found out that she actually made classified information available through her private server that could have been hacked and exposed by enemies of this county. That had sensitive information, including information about drone strikes.The real scandal is that we’re finding out more and more every day that Hillary Clinton, while she was secretary of state, and her husband, were operating a foundation that allowed foreign donors to contribute millions of dollars that wouldn’t otherwise be able to contribute to American politics. And, you know, this wasn't unknown.When Indiana Senator Richard Luger was questioning Secretary of State Clinton during her confirmation hearings, he warned her about the potential that foreign individuals would try to take advantage of the Clinton Foundation. I’m told that President Obama and his team actually asked her create a firewall, and now more emails that come out -- David, I just have to tell you, we’ll release all the information on our tax records, Donald Trump will release his tax returns when his audit is done -- but I believe this is all a distraction by many in the media who simple don’t want to focus on this widening scandal around the Clinton Foundation and this pay-to-play program that happened during Hillary Clinton’s years as secretary of state.MUIR: I do want to let you both know that we pressed her on the Clinton Foundation before we sat down with the two of you.TRUMP: That’s fine. But, by the way, the FBI interviewed her during a major holiday, maybe it was the Fourth of July. Nobody ever heard of a thing like that. Then they released her papers late just prior to Labor Day weekend where people were away and not watching you show as much et cetera, et cetera. You need to say, what’s going on?Now, as far as my taxes are concerned, the only one that cares is the press, I will tell you. And even the press, I tell you, it’s not a big deal.MUIR: You don't think there are voters out there who--TRUMP: I don’t think so. I think people don't care. But for two reasons: Number one, I released the most extensive financial review of anybody in the history of politics. It’s either 100 or maybe more pages of names of companies, locations of companies, et cetera, et cetera, and it's a very impressive list and everybody says that. But I released a massive list, far more than you-- you don't learn much in a tax return.Number two, when this routine audit is done -- and I’ve been audited, I think, for 15 straight years -- when the audit is done, I’ll release them. I don't know when that's gonna be, it could be soon, it could be not. But every lawyer will tell you -- I was watching one of your competitors who happens to be a lawyer and said, well, nobody will release during what's called a routine audit. And that’s it. I don't think anybody cares, except some members of the press. I really don’t.MUIR: Tax returns do reveal how much someone has paid in taxes. And how much they've given in charitable giving.TRUMP: Well that's OK. But i've given a list on things that are given to charity. I have given that list. In fact, I made that list available. I’ve made a list available.MUIR: But you won’t reveal what you’ve paid in taxes unless the audit is done?TRUMP: When the audit is done, it will happen. I mean, I’ve gone through audits almost my whole adult life.MUIR: Before we head out into the crowd that’s waiting outside. We sit here in Ohio, very popular governor, John Kasich, you've stood on that debate stage against him. I’m curious, Governor Pence, do you believe that Mr. Trump is getting the support that’s expected for a Republican nominee from leaders of the Republican party. Is it adequate?PENCE: Well I think were earning more support each and every day.MUIR: But what about Governor Kasich here in Ohio?PENCE: Well we've been in contact with him. I hold Governor Kasich in high regard. Look, these two went through a tough competition together. I respect that, these things sometimes take time. But you know, I was in Utah just the other day with Governor Gary Herbert and Senator Orrin Hatch, I think we're seeing members of Congress, we’re seeing governors around the country coming alongside Donald Trump. But what gets me even more excited by a lot is the thousands of people at the county fair today. It's the thousands of people that turn out on very short notice for rallies for Donald Trump or with Donald Trump.I mean, this is a man who has spoken into the heart of the American people, who know we can do better. Who know that seven and a half years of the kind of leadership that Barack Obama, what Hillary Clinton will continue, has weakened America's place in the world, it’s stifled America’s economy, and walked away from the constitutional framework our founders enshrined. And the Supreme Court is an enormously important issue.With all due respect, David, as you’ve talked about a couple of issues in this interview, what I hear about, when I’m campaigning with Donald Trump or for Donald Trump are the security of the American people, the prosperity of the American people, the Supreme Court of the United States and ensuring that we have the highest standards of integrity in the highest office in the land and on every one of those issues Donald Trump is the clear choice.MUIR: And you’ll make that case on that debate stage?TRUMP: Well I think so and you know I'm disappointed that people signed a pledge -- and they signed it so I would sign it, just so you remember. The pledges were signed by everybody so that I would sign it because they didn’t want me to be out there as a free agent, so to speak. But I’m disappointed-- and most of them came through, Ben Carson, Mike Huckabee, we have so much-- Chris Christie, I have so much support. People don’t talk about the support.MUIR: But as you sit here in Ohio, are you upset with Governor Kasich?TRUMP: I would say I’m disappointed because we are winning Ohio, we’re doing great nationally, as you understand. I mean, we’re doing very well, I think we’re going to win. I don’t think the American people are going to allow four more years of Barack Obama and that’s what they’ll get with Hillary Clinton except I think it’ll be even worse.MUIR: Thank you, Mr. Trump. Governor Pence. Thank you.TRUMP: Thank you."	1.0

(The Washington Post)The final debate of the 2016 presidential race came as Hillary Clinton threatened to shut the door on Donald Trump and as Donald Trump threatened to unleash a torrent of attacks and accusations about the ""rigged"" election process.As the two met in Las Vegas on Wednesday night, we posted the transcript below, along with our analysis, fact checks and comments via annotation. To see an annotation, click on the highlighted text. To make your own, sign up for a Genius account .WALLACE: Good evening from the Thomas and Mack Center at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. I'm Chris Wallace of Fox News, and I welcome you to the third and final of the 2016 presidential debates between Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.WALLACE: This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The commission has designed the format: Six roughly 15-minute segments with two-minute answers to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment. Both campaigns have agreed to those rules.For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic. None of those questions has been shared with the commission or the two candidates. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, boos, or other interruptions so we and you can focus on what the candidates have to say.WALLACE: No noise, except right now, as we welcome the Democratic nominee for president, Secretary Clinton, and the Republican nominee for president, Mr. Trump.(APPLAUSE)Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump, welcome. Let's get right to it. The first topic is the Supreme Court.You both talked briefly about the court in the last debate, but I want to drill down on this, because the next president will almost certainly have at least one appointment and likely or possibly two or three appointments.WALLACE: Which means that you will, in effect, determine the balance of the court for what could be the next quarter century.First of all, where do you want to see the court take the country? And secondly, what's your view on how the Constitution should be interpreted? Do the founders' words mean what they say or is it a living document to be applied flexibly according to changing circumstances? In this segment, Secretary Clinton, you go first. You have two minutes.CLINTON: Thank you very much, Chris. And thanks to UNLV for hosting us.You know, I think when we talk about the Supreme Court, it really raises the central issue in this election, namely, what kind of country are we going to be? What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens? What kind of rights will Americans have?And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy. For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women's rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system.I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court. But I feel that at this point in our country's history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v. Wade, that we stand up against Citizens United, we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say: The Supreme Court should represent all of us.That's how I see the court, and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans.And I look forward to having that opportunity. I would hope that the Senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that President Obama has sent to them. That's the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate. The president nominates, and then the Senate advises and consents, or not, but they go forward with the process.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, thank you.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, same question. Where do you want to see the court take the country? And how do you believe the Constitution should be interpreted?TRUMP: Well, first of all, it's great to be with you, and thank you, everybody. The Supreme Court: It's what it's all about. Our country is so, so -- it's just so imperative that we have the right justices.Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent. And she was forced to apologize. And apologize she did. But these were statements that should never, ever have been made.We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the Second Amendment, and all amendments, but the Second Amendment, which is under absolute siege. I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don't think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now. But I feel that it's absolutely important that we uphold, because of the fact that it is under such trauma.I feel that the justices that I am going to appoint -- and I've named 20 of them -- the justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life. They will have a conservative bent. They will be protecting the Second Amendment. They are great scholars in all cases, and they're people of tremendous respect. They will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted. And I believe that's very, very important.I don't think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear. It's all about the Constitution of -- of -- and so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be. And those are the people that I will appoint.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, thank you.WALLACE: We now have about 10 minutes for an open discussion. I want to focus on two issues that, in fact, by the justices that you name could end up changing the existing law of the land. First is one that you mentioned, Mr. Trump, and that is guns.Secretary Clinton, you said last year, let me quote, ""The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment."" And now, in fact, in the 2008 Heller case, the court ruled that there is a constitutional right to bear arms, but a right that is reasonably limited. Those were the words of the Judge Antonin Scalia who wrote the decision. What's wrong with that?CLINTON: Well, first of all, I support the Second Amendment. I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years. I represented upstate New York. I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership. It goes back to the founding of our country.But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation. Because I support the Second Amendment doesn't mean that I want people who shouldn't have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family.And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns. I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole. There's other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment.You mentioned the Heller decision. And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them. And the court didn't accept that reasonable regulation, but they've accepted many others. So I see no conflict between saving people's lives and defending the Second Amendment.WALLACE: Let me bring Mr. Trump in here. The bipartisan Open Debate Coalition got millions of votes on questions to ask here, and this was, in fact, one of the top questions that they got. How will you ensure the Second Amendment is protected? You just heard Secretary Clinton's answer. Does she persuade you that, while you may disagree on regulation, that, in fact, she supports a Second Amendment right to bear arms? TRUMP: Well, the D.C. vs. Heller decision was very strongly -- and she was extremely angry about it. I watched. I mean, she was very, very angry when upheld. And Justice Scalia was so involved. And it was a well-crafted decision. But Hillary was extremely upset, extremely angry. And people that believe in the Second Amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say.WALLACE: Well, let me bring in Secretary Clinton. Were you extremely upset?CLINTON: Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions.But there's no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment, that I also believe there's an individual right to bear arms. That is not in conflict with sensible, commonsense regulation.And, you know, look, I understand that Donald's been strongly supported by the NRA. The gun lobby's on his side. They're running millions of dollars of ads against me. And I regret that, because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say: Of course we're going to protect and defend the Second Amendment. But we're going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year.WALLACE: Let me bring Mr. Trump back into this, because, in fact, you oppose any limits on assault weapons, any limits on high- capacity magazines. You support a national right to carry law. Why, sir?TRUMP: Well, let me just tell you before we go any further. In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city. So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence.I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment. And I am -- I don't know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but I'm very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA. And it's the earliest endorsement they've ever given to anybody who ran for president. So I'm very honored by all of that.We are going to appoint justices -- this is the best way to help the Second Amendment. We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment, that will not do damage to the Second Amendment.WALLACE: Well, let's pick up on another issue which divides you and the justices that whoever ends up winning this election appoints could have a dramatic effect there, and that's the issue of abortion.TRUMP: Right.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, you're pro-life. But I want to ask you specifically: Do you want the court, including the justices that you will name, to overturn Roe v. Wade, which includes -- in fact, states -- a woman's right to abortion?TRUMP: Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states.WALLACE: But I'm asking you specifically. Would you like to...TRUMP: If they overturned it, it will go back to the states.WALLACE: But what I'm asking you, sir, is, do you want to see the court overturn -- you just said you want to see the court protect the Second Amendment. Do you want to see the court overturn Roe v. Wade?TRUMP: Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justice on, that's really what's going to be -- that will happen. And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court. I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, I strongly support Roe v. Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine. And in this case, it's not only about Roe v. Wade. It is about what's happening right now in America.So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood, which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country.Donald has said he's in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood. He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood. I will defend Planned Parenthood. I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women's rights to make their own health care decisions.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton... CLINTON: And we have come too far to have that turned back now. And, indeed, he said women should be punished, that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions. And I could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking.WALLACE: I'm going to give you a chance to respond, but I want to ask you, Secretary Clinton, I want to explore how far you believe the right to abortion goes. You have been quoted as saying that the fetus has no constitutional rights. You also voted against a ban on late-term, partial-birth abortions. Why?CLINTON: Because Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account. And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case.The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make. I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy. I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions. So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, your reaction? And particularly on this issue of late-term, partial-birth abortions.TRUMP: Well, I think it's terrible. If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.Now, you can say that that's OK and Hillary can say that that's OK. But it's not OK with me, because based on what she's saying, and based on where she's going, and where she's been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day. And that's not acceptable.CLINTON: Well, that is not what happens in these cases. And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate. You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life. This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make. And I do not believe the government should be making it.You know, I've had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country. I've been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania. And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice. And I will stand up for that right.WALLACE: All right. But just briefly, I want to move on to another segment...TRUMP: And, honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that, as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth. Nobody has that.WALLACE: All right. Let's move on to the subject of immigration. And there is almost no issue that separates the two of you more than the issue of immigration. Actually, there are a lot of issues that separate the two of you.Mr. Trump, you want to build a wall. Secretary Clinton, you have offered no specific plan for how you want to secure our southern border. Mr. Trump, you are calling for major deportations. Secretary Clinton, you say that within your first 100 days as president you're going to offer a package that includes a pathway to citizenship. The question, really, is, why are you right and your opponent wrong?Mr. Trump, you go first in this segment. You have two minutes.TRUMP: Well, first of all, she wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many, many years. We need strong borders.In the audience tonight, we have four mothers of -- I mean, these are unbelievable people that I've gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed, brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally. You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country. They're coming in illegally. Drugs are pouring in through the border. We have no country if we have no border.Hillary wants to give amnesty. She wants to have open borders. The border -- as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus ICE last week, endorsed me. First time they've ever endorsed a candidate. It means their job is tougher. But they know what's going on. They know it better than anybody. They want strong borders. They feel we have to have strong borders.I was up in New Hampshire the other day. The biggest complaint they have -- it's with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama. All of the problems -- the single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border. It's just pouring and destroying their youth. It's poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people. We have to have strong borders. We have to keep the drugs out of our country. We are -- right now, we're getting the drugs, they're getting the cash. We need strong borders. We need absolute -- we cannot give amnesty.Now, I want to build the wall. We need the wall. And the Border Patrol, ICE, they all want the wall. We stop the drugs. We shore up the border. One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones -- we have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out. We're going to get them out; we're going to secure the border. And once the border is secured, at a later date, we'll make a determination as to the rest. But we have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, thank you. Same question to you, Secretary Clinton. Basically, why are you right and Mr. Trump is wrong?CLINTON: Well, as he was talking, I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas, Carla, who is very worried that her parents might be deported, because she was born in this country but they were not. They work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life.And you're right. I don't want to rip families apart. I don't want to be sending parents away from children. I don't want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country.We have 11 million undocumented people. They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people. He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation. Now, here's what that means. It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented. And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country.I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation. I think it's an idea that would rip our country apart.I have been for border security for years. I voted for border security in the United States Senate. And my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security. But I want to put our resources where I think they're most needed: Getting rid of any violent person. Anybody who should be deported, we should deport them.When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president. Didn't even raise it. He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we're not paying for that wall.So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly. And that's why I'm introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with the path to citizenship.WALLACE: Thank you, Secretary Clinton. I want to follow up...TRUMP: Chris, I think it's...WALLACE: OK.TRUMP: I think I should respond to that. First of all, I had a very good meeting with the president of Mexico. Very nice man. We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals. Believe me. The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind, signed by anybody. It's a disaster.Hillary Clinton wanted the wall. Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts. Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn't built. But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.WALLACE: Well, let me -- wait, wait, sir, let me...TRUMP: We are a country of laws. We either have -- and by the way...WALLACE: Now, wait. I'd like to hear from...TRUMP: Well -- well, but she said one thing.WALLACE: I'd like to hear -- I'd like to hear from Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: I voted for border security, and there are...TRUMP: And the wall.CLINTON: There are some limited places where that was appropriate. There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that.But it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants.Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good, because then employers can't exploit them and undercut Americans' wages.And Donald knows a lot about this. He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower. He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: ""You complain, I'll get you deported.""I want to get everybody out of the shadows, get the economy working, and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers, which hurts them, but also hurts American workers.WALLACE: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: President Obama has moved millions of people out. Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it. But under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country. They've been deported. She doesn't want to say that, but that's what's happened, and that's what happened big league.As far as moving these people out and moving -- we either have a country or we don't. We're a country of laws. We either have a border or we don't.Now, you can come back in and you can become a citizen. But it's very unfair. We have millions of people that did it the right way. They're on line. They're waiting. We're going to speed up the process, big league, because it's very inefficient. But they're on line and they're waiting to become citizens.Very unfair that somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen, under her plan, you have open borders. You would have a disaster on trade, and you will have a disaster with your open borders.WALLACE: I want to...TRUMP: But what she doesn't say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, I want to...CLINTON: We will not have open borders. That is...WALLACE: Well, let me -- Secretary...CLINTON: That is a rank mischaracterization.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton...CLINTON: We will have secure borders, but we'll also have reform. And this used to be a bipartisan issue. Ronald Reagan was the last president...WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, excuse me. Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: ... to sign immigration reform, and George W. Bush supported it, as well.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, I want to clear up your position on this issue, because in a speech you gave to a Brazilian bank, for which you were paid $225,000, we've learned from the WikiLeaks, that you said this, and I want to quote. ""My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders."" So that's the question...TRUMP: Thank you.WALLACE: That's the question. Please quiet, everybody. Is that your dream, open borders? CLINTON: Well, if you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy. You know, we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined. And I do want us to have an electric grid, an energy system that crosses borders. I think that would be a great benefit to us.But you are very clearly quoting from WikiLeaks. And what's really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans. They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions. Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the Internet.This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly, from Putin himself, in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election.CLINTON: So I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is, finally, will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in in this election, that he rejects Russian espionage against Americans, which he actually encouraged in the past? Those are the questions we need answered. We've never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before.WALLACE: Well?TRUMP: That was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders, OK? How did we get on to Putin?WALLACE: Hold on -- hold on, wait. Hold on, folks. Because we -- this is going to end up getting out of control. Let's try to keep it quiet so -- for the candidates and for the American people.TRUMP: So just to finish on the borders...WALLACE: Yes?TRUMP: She wants open borders. People are going to pour into our country. People are going to come in from Syria. She wants 550 percent more people than Barack Obama, and he has thousands and thousands of people. They have no idea where they come from.And you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country. She won't even mention the words, and neither will President Obama. So I just want to tell you, she wants open borders.Now we can talk about Putin. I don't know Putin. He said nice things about me. If we got along well, that would be good. If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good.He has no respect for her. He has no respect for our president. And I'll tell you what: We're in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads -- 1,800, by the way -- where they expanded and we didn't, 1,800 nuclear warheads. And she's playing chicken. Look, Putin...WALLACE: Wait, but...TRUMP: ... from everything I see, has no respect for this person.CLINTON: Well, that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States.TRUMP: No puppet. No puppet.CLINTON: And it's pretty clear...TRUMP: You're the puppet!CLINTON: It's pretty clear you won't admit...TRUMP: No, you're the puppet.CLINTON: ... that the Russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do, and that you continue to get help from him, because he has a very clear favorite in this race.So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation. We've never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election. We have 17 -- 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our election. I find that deeply disturbing.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton...CLINTON: And I think it's time you take a stand...TRUMP: She has no idea whether it's Russia, China, or anybody else.CLINTON: I am not quoting myself.TRUMP: She has no idea.CLINTON: I am quoting 17...TRUMP: Hillary, you have no idea.CLINTON: ... 17 intelligence -- do you doubt 17 military and civilian...TRUMP: And our country has no idea.CLINTON: ... agencies.TRUMP: Yeah, I doubt it. I doubt it.CLINTON: Well, he'd rather believe Vladimir Putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us. I find that just absolutely...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: She doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.WALLACE: Mr. Trump...TRUMP: Excuse me. Putin has outsmarted her in Syria.WALLACE: Mr. Trump...TRUMP: He's outsmarted her every step of the way.WALLACE: I do get to ask some questions.TRUMP: Yes, that's fine.WALLACE: And I would like to ask you this direct question. The top national security officials of this country do believe that Russia has been behind these hacks. Even if you don't know for sure whether they are, do you condemn any interference by Russia in the American election?TRUMP: By Russia or anybody else.WALLACE: You condemn their interference?TRUMP: Of course I condemn. Of course I -- I don't know Putin. I have no idea.WALLACE: I'm not asking -- I'm asking do you condemn?TRUMP: I never met Putin. This is not my best friend. But if the United States got along with Russia, wouldn't be so bad.Let me tell you, Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way. Whether it's Syria, you name it. Missiles. Take a look at the ""start up"" that they signed. The Russians have said, according to many, many reports, I can't believe they allowed us to do this. They create warheads, and we can't. The Russians can't believe it. She has been outsmarted by Putin.And all you have to do is look at the Middle East. They've taken over. We've spent $6 trillion. They've taken over the Middle East. She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I've ever seen in any government whatsoever.WALLACE: We're a long way away from immigration, but I'm going to let you finish this topic. You got about 45 seconds.TRUMP: And she always will be.CLINTON: I -- I find it ironic that he's raising nuclear weapons. This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons. He's...TRUMP: Wrong. CLINTON: ... advocated more countries getting them, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia. He said, well, if we have them, why don't we use them, which I think is terrifying.But here's the deal. The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed. There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so. And that's why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and, in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button.TRUMP: I have 200 generals...WALLACE: Very quickly.TRUMP: ... and admirals, 21 endorsing me, 21 congressional Medal of Honor recipients. As far as Japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody in the -- we're defending other countries. We are spending a fortune doing it. They have the bargain of the century.All I said is, we have to renegotiate these agreements, because our country cannot afford to defend Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, and many other places. We cannot continue to afford -- she took that as saying nuclear weapons.WALLACE: OK.TRUMP: Look, she's been proven to be a liar on so many different ways. This is just another lie.CLINTON: Well, I'm just quoting you when you were asked...TRUMP: There's no quote. You're not going to find a quote from me.CLINTON: ... about a potential nuclear -- nuclear competition in Asia, you said, you know, go ahead, enjoy yourselves, folks. That kind...TRUMP: And defend yourselves.CLINTON: ... of language -- well...TRUMP: And defend yourselves. I didn't say nuclear. And defend yourself.CLINTON: The United States has kept the peace -- the United States has kept the peace through our alliances. Donald wants to tear up our alliances. I think it makes the world safer and, frankly, it makes the United States safer. I would work with our allies in Asia, in Europe, in the Middle East, and elsewhere. That's the only way we're going to be able to keep the peace.WALLACE: We're going to -- no, we are going to move on to the next topic, which is the economy. And I hope we handle that as well as we did immigration. You also have very different ideas about how to get the economy growing faster. Secretary Clinton, in your plan, government plays a big role. You see more government spending, more entitlements, more tax credits, more tax penalties. Mr. Trump, you want to get government out with lower taxes and less regulation.TRUMP: Yes.WALLACE: We're going to drill down into this a little bit more. But in this overview, please explain to me why you believe that your plan will create more jobs and growth for this country and your opponent's plan will not. In this round, you go first, Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Well, I think when the middle class thrives, America thrives. And so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities. I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing. I think we can compete with high-wage countries, and I believe we should. New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses.I want us to do more to help small business. That's where two- thirds of the new jobs are going to come from. I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not -- who work full-time should not still be in poverty. And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do.I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college. That's why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future. I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted.And we're going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is. Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top. So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share. We're going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country.That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs. By contrast, Donald's plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3.5 million jobs. Why? Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids.So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities. The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another Great Recession.WALLACE: Secretary, thank you. Mr. Trump, why will your plan create more jobs and growth than Secretary Clinton's?TRUMP: Well, first of all, before I start on my plan, her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes. Her tax plan is a disaster. And she can say all she wants about college tuition. And I'm a big proponent. We're going to do a lot of things for college tuition. But the rest of the public's going to be paying for it. We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton's plan.TRUMP: But I'd like to start off where we left, because when I said Japan and Germany, and I'm -- not to single them out, but South Korea, these are very rich, powerful countries. Saudi Arabia, nothing but money. We protect Saudi Arabia. Why aren't they paying?She immediately -- when she heard this, I questioned it, and I questioned NATO. Why aren't the NATO questioned -- why aren't they paying? Because they weren't paying.Since I did this -- this was a year ago -- all of a sudden, they're paying. And I've been given a lot -- a lot of credit for it. All of a sudden, they're starting to pay up. They have to pay up. We're protecting people, they have to pay up. And I'm a big fan of NATO. But they have to pay up.She comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great. Well, it's awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are.We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out. We have, during his regime, during President Obama's regime, we've doubled our national debt. We're up to $20 trillion.So my plan -- we're going to renegotiate trade deals. We're going to have a lot of free trade. We're going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now. But we have horrible deals. Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever. Our jobs are being sucked out of our economy.You look at all of the places that I just left, you go to Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio, you go to Florida, you go to any of them. You go upstate New York. Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places. We're bringing our jobs back.I am going to renegotiate NAFTA. And if I can't make a great deal -- then we're going to terminate NAFTA and we're going to create new deals. We're going to have trade, but we're going -- we're going to terminate it, we're going to make a great trade deal.And if we can't, we're going to do it -- we're going to go a separate way, because it has been a disaster. We are going to cut taxes massively. We're going to cut business taxes massively. They're going to start hiring people. We're going to bring the $2.5 trillion...WALLACE: Time, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: ... that's offshore back into the country. We are going to start the engine rolling again, because...WALLACE: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: ... right now, our country is dying at 1 percent GDP.CLINTON: Well, let me translate that, if I can, Chris, because...TRUMP: You can't.CLINTON: ... the fact is, he's going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we've ever seen, three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration. I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign: I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less.I also will not add a penny to the debt. I have costed out what I'm going to do. He will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt.Well, he mentioned the debt. We know how to get control of the debt. When my husband was president, we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt. When President Obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression. He has cut the deficit by two-thirds.So, yes, one of the ways you go after the debt, one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people. So I do have investments, investments in new jobs, investments in education, skill training, and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead. That's the kind of approach that will work.WALLACE: Secretary...CLINTON: Cutting taxes on the wealthy, we've tried that. It has not worked the way that it has been promised.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, I want to pursue your plan, because in many ways it is similar to the Obama stimulus plan in 2009, which has led to the slowest GDP growth since 1949.TRUMP: Correct.WALLACE: Thank you, sir.You told me in July when we spoke that the problem is that President Obama didn't get to do enough in what he was trying to do with his stimulus. So is your plan basically more -- even more of the Obama stimulus?CLINTON: Well, it's a combination, Chris. And let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that President Obama inherited, it was a real touch-and-go situation. I was in the Senate before I became secretary of state. I've never seen people as physically distraught as the Bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy.I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy. He doesn't get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions. But it was a terrible recession.So now we've dug ourselves out of it, we're standing, but we're not yet running. So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up, not the top down. That is not going to work.That's why what I have put forward doesn't add a penny to the debt, but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs, higher-paying jobs. We're beginning to see some increase in incomes, and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs. We've got to do more to get the whole economy moving, and that's what I believe I will be able to do.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, even conservative economists who have looked at your plan say that the numbers don't add up, that your idea, and you've talked about 25 million jobs created, 4 percent...TRUMP: Over a 10-year period.WALLACE: ... growth is unrealistic. And they say -- you talk a lot about growing the energy industry. They say with oil prices as low as they are right now, that's unrealistic, as well. Your response, sir?TRUMP: So I just left some high representatives of India. They're growing at 8 percent. China is growing at 7 percent. And that for them is a catastrophically low number.We are growing -- our last report came out -- and it's right around the 1 percent level. And I think it's going down. Last week, as you know, the end of last week, they came out with an anemic jobs report. A terrible jobs report. In fact I said, is that the last jobs report before the election? Because if it is, I should win easily, it was so bad. The report was so bad.Look, our country is stagnant. We've lost our jobs. We've lost our businesses. We're not making things anymore, relatively speaking. Our product is pouring in from China, pouring in from Vietnam, pouring in from all over the world.I've visited so many communities. This has been such an incredible education for me, Chris. I've gotten to know so many -- I've developed so many friends over the last year. And they cry when they see what's happened. I pass factories that were thriving 20, 25 years ago, and because of the bill that her husband signed and she blessed 100 percent, it is just horrible what's happened to these people in these communities.Now, she can say that her husband did well, but, boy, did they suffer as NAFTA kicked in, because it didn't really kick in very much, but it kicked in after they left. Boy, did they suffer. That was one of the worst things that's ever been signed by our country.Now she wants to sign Trans-Pacific Partnership. And she wants it. She lied when she said she didn't call it the gold standard in one of the debates. She totally lied. She did call it the gold standard. And they actually fact checked, and they said I was right. I was so honored.WALLACE: I want you to give you a chance to briefly speak to that, and then I want to pivot to one-sixth of the economy...TRUMP: And that will be as bad as NAFTA.WALLACE: ... which is Obamacare. But go ahead, briefly.CLINTON: Well, first, let me say, number one, when I saw the final agreement for TPP, I said I was against it. It didn't meet my test. I've had the same test. Does it create jobs, raise incomes, and further our national security? I'm against it now. I'll be against it after the election. I'll be against it when I'm president.There's only one of us on this stage who's actually shipped jobs to Mexico, because that's Donald. He's shipped jobs to 12 countries, including Mexico.But he mentioned China. And, you know, one of the biggest problems we have with China is the illegal dumping of steel and aluminum into our markets. I have fought against that as a senator. I've stood up against it as secretary of state.Donald has bought Chinese steel and aluminum. In fact, the Trump Hotel right here in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel. So he goes around with crocodile tears about how terrible it is, but he has given jobs to Chinese steelworkers, not American steelworkers.WALLACE: Mr. Trump?CLINTON: That's the kind of approach that is just not going to work.TRUMP: Well, let me just say -- let me just say.CLINTON: We're going to pull the country together. We're going to have trade agreements that we enforce. That's why I'm going to have a trade prosecutor for the first time in history. And we're going to enforce those agreements, and we're going to look for businesses to help us by buying American products.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton? Go ahead, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Let me ask a simple question. She's been doing this for 30 years. Why the hell didn't you do it over the last 15, 20 years?CLINTON: No, I voted.TRUMP: You were very much involved -- excuse me. My turn. You were very much involved in every aspect of this country. Very much. And you do have experience. I say the one thing you have over me is experience, but it's bad experience, because what you've done has turned out badly.For 30 years, you've been in a position to help, and if you say that I use steel or I use something else, I -- make it impossible for me to do that. I wouldn't mind.The problem is, you talk, but you don't get anything done, Hillary. You don't. Just like when you ran the State Department, $6 billion was missing. How do you miss $6 billion? You ran the State Department, $6 billion was either stolen. They don't know. It's gone, $6 billion. If you become president, this country is going to be in some mess. Believe me.CLINTON: Well, first of all, what he just said about the State Department is not only untrue, it's been debunked numerous times.CLINTON: But I think it's really an important issue. He raised the 30 years of experience, so let me just talk briefly about that. You know, back in the 1970s, I worked for the Children's Defense Fund. And I was taking on discrimination against African-American kids in schools. He was getting sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings.In the 1980s, I was working to reform the schools in Arkansas. He was borrowing $14 million from his father to start his businesses. In the 1990s, I went to Beijing and I said women's rights are human rights. He insulted a former Miss Universe, Alicia Machado, called her an eating machine.TRUMP: Give me a break.CLINTON: And on the day when I was in the Situation Room, monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting the ""Celebrity Apprentice."" So I'm happy to compare my 30 years of experience, what I've done for this country, trying to help in every way I could, especially kids and families get ahead and stay ahead, with your 30 years, and I'll let the American people make that decision.TRUMP: Well, I think I did a much better job. I built a massive company, a great company, some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, worth many, many billions of dollars. I started with a $1 million loan. I agree with that. It's a $1 million loan. But I built a phenomenal company.And if we could run our country the way I've run my company, we would have a country that you would be so proud of. You would even be proud of it.And frankly, when you look at her real record, take a look at Syria. Take a look at the migration. Take a look at Libya. Take a look at Iraq. She gave us ISIS, because her and Obama created this huge vacuum, and a small group came out of that huge vacuum because when -- we should never have been in Iraq, but once we were there, we should have never got out the way they wanted to get out. She gave us ISIS as sure as you are sitting there. And what happened is now ISIS is in 32 countries. And now I listen how she's going to get rid of ISIS. She's going to get rid of nobody.WALLACE: All right. We are going to get to foreign hot spots in a few moments, but the next segment is fitness to be president of the United States. Mr. Trump, at the last debate, you said your talk about grabbing women was just that, talk, and that you'd never actually done it. And since then, as we all know, nine women have come forward and have said that you either groped them or kissed them without their consent.Why would so many different women from so many different circumstances over so many different years, why would they all in this last couple of weeks make up -- you deny this -- why would they all make up these stories?Since this is a question for both of you, Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump says what your husband did and that you defended was even worse. Mr. Trump, you go first.TRUMP: Well, first of all, those stories have been largely debunked. Those people -- I don't know those people. I have a feeling how they came. I believe it was her campaign that did it.Just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence? She's the one and Obama that caused the violence. They hired people -- they paid them $1,500, and they're on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things.I would say the only way -- because those stories are all totally false, I have to say that. And I didn't even apologize to my wife, who's sitting right here, because I didn't do anything. I didn't know any of these -- I didn't see these women.These women -- the woman on the plane, the -- I think they want either fame or her campaign did it. And I think it's her campaign. Because what I saw what they did, which is a criminal act, by the way, where they're telling people to go out and start fist-fights and start violence.And I'll tell you what, in particular in Chicago, people were hurt and people could have been killed in that riot. And that was now all on tape, started by her. I believe, Chris, that she got these people to step forward. If it wasn't, they get their 10 minutes of fame. But they were all totally -- it was all fiction. It was lies, and it was fiction.CLINTON: Well...WALLACE: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: At the last debate, we heard Donald talking about what he did to women. And after that, a number of women have come forward saying that's exactly what he did to them. Now, what was his response? Well, he held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for them to be assaulted.TRUMP: I did not say that. I did not say that.CLINTON: In fact, he went on to say... WALLACE: Her two minutes -- sir, her two minutes. Her two minutes.TRUMP: I did not say that.WALLACE: It's her two minutes.CLINTON: He went on to say, ""Look at her. I don't think so."" About another woman, he said, ""That wouldn't be my first choice."" He attacked the woman reporter writing the story, called her ""disgusting,"" as he has called a number of women during this campaign.Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger. He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don't think there is a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like. So we now know what Donald thinks and what he says and how he acts toward women. That's who Donald is.I think it's really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is, and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we don't want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other, where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater.America is great, because America is good. And it really is up to all of us to make that true, now and in the future, and particularly for our children and our grandchildren.WALLACE: Mr. Trump...TRUMP: Nobody has more respect for women than I do. Nobody.(LAUGHTER)Nobody has more respect...WALLACE: Please, everybody.TRUMP: And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked. And I really want to just talk about something slightly different.She mentions this, which is all fiction, all fictionalized, probably or possibly started by her and her very sleazy campaign. But I will tell you what isn't fictionalized are her e-mails, where she destroyed 33,000 e-mails criminally, criminally, after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.What happened to the FBI, I don't know. We have a great general, four-star general, today you read it in all of the papers, going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI. One lie. She's lied hundreds of times to the people, to Congress, and to the FBI. He's going to probably go to jail. This is a four-star general. And she gets away with it, and she can run for the presidency of the United States? That's really what you should be talking about, not fiction, where somebody wants fame or where they come out of her crooked campaign.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, every time Donald is pushed on something which is obviously uncomfortable, like what these women are saying, he immediately goes to denying responsibility. And it's not just about women. He never apologizes or says he's sorry for anything.So we know what he has said and what he's done to women. But he also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked him on national television.TRUMP: Wrong.CLINTON: He went after Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the parents of a young man who died serving our country, a Gold Star family, because of their religion. He went after John McCain, a prisoner of war, said he prefers ""people who aren't captured."" He went after a federal judge, born in Indiana, but who Donald said couldn't be trusted to try the fraud and racketeering case against Trump University because his parents were Mexican.So it's not one thing. This is a pattern, a pattern of divisiveness, of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country, where he incites violence, where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies. That is not who America is.And I hope that as we move in the last weeks of this campaign, more and more people will understand what's at stake in this election. It really does come down to what kind of country we are going to have.TRUMP: So sad when she talks about violence at my rallies, and she caused the violence. It's on tape.WALLACE: During the last...TRUMP: The other things are false, but honestly, I'd love to talk about getting rid of ISIS, and I'd love to talk about other things...WALLACE: OK.TRUMP: ... but those other charges, as she knows, are false.WALLACE: In this bucket about fitness to be president, there's been a lot of developments over the last 10 days since the last debate. I'd like to ask you about them. These are questions that the American people have.Secretary Clinton, during your 2009 Senate confirmation hearing, you promised to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest with your dealing with the Clinton Foundation while you were secretary of state, but e-mails show that donors got special access to you. Those seeking grants for Haiti relief were considered separately from non-donors, and some of those donors got contracts, government contracts, taxpayer money.Can you really say that you kept your pledge to that Senate committee? And why isn't what happened and what went on between you and the Clinton Foundation, why isn't it what Mr. Trump calls pay to play?CLINTON: Well, everything I did as secretary of state was in furtherance of our country's interests and our values. The State Department has said that. I think that's been proven.But I am happy, in fact I'm thrilled to talk about the Clinton Foundation, because it is a world-renowned charity and I am so proud of the work that it does. You know, I could talk for the rest of the debate -- I know I don't have the time to do that.But just briefly, the Clinton Foundation made it possible for 11 million people around the world with HIV-AIDS to afford treatment, and that's about half all the people in the world who are getting treatment. In partnership with the American Health Association...WALLACE: Secretary Clinton...CLINTON: ... we have made environments in schools healthier for kids, including healthier lunches...WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, respectfully, this is -- this is an open discussion.CLINTON: Well, it is an open discussion. And you...WALLACE: And the specific question went to pay for play. Do you want to talk about that?CLINTON: Well, but there is no -- but there is no evidence -- but there is...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: I think that it's been very well...WALLACE: Let's ask Mr. Trump.CLINTON: There is a lot of evidence about the very good work...TRUMP: It's been very well studied.CLINTON: ... and the high rankings...(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Please let me Mr. Trump speak.TRUMP: ... and it's a criminal enterprise, and so many people know it.WALLACE: Please let Mr. Trump speak.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: It's a criminal enterprise. Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries. You talk about women and women's rights? So these are people that push gays off business -- off buildings. These are people that kill women and treat women horribly. And yet you take their money.So I'd like to ask you right now, why don't you give back the money that you've taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly? Why don't you give back the money? I think it would be a great gesture.Because she takes a tremendous amount of money. And you take a look at the people of Haiti. I was at a little Haiti the other day in Florida. And I want to tell you, they hate the Clintons, because what's happened in Haiti with the Clinton Foundation is a disgrace. And you know it, and they know it, and everybody knows it.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, very quickly, we at the Clinton Foundation spend 90 percent -- 90 percent of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country. I'm very proud of that. We have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations. And I'd be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six- foot portrait of Donald. I mean, who does that? It just was astonishing.But when it comes to Haiti, Haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere. The earthquake and the hurricanes, it has devastated Haiti. Bill and I have been involved in trying to help Haiti for many years. The Clinton Foundation raised $30 million to help Haiti after the catastrophic earthquake and all of the terrible problems the people there had.We have done things to help small businesses, agriculture, and so much else. And we're going to keep working to help Haiti...WALLACE: All right.CLINTON: ... because it's an important part of the American experience.TRUMP: They don't want you to help them anymore.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: I'd like to mention one thing. Trump Foundation, small foundation. People contribute, I contribute. The money goes 100 percent -- 100 percent goes to different charities, including a lot of military. I don't get anything. I don't buy boats. I don't buy planes. What happens -- the money goes to them.WALLACE: Wasn't some of the money used to settle your lawsuits, sir?TRUMP: No, it was -- we put up the American flag. And that's it. They put up the American flag. We fought for the right in Palm Beach to put up the American flag.WALLACE: Right. But there was a penalty that was imposed by Palm Beach County, and the money came from your foundation...TRUMP: There was. There was. And, by the way...WALLACE: ... instead of Mar-a-Lago or yourself, sir.TRUMP: ... the money -- the money went to Fisher House, where they build houses -- the money that you're talking about went to Fisher House, where they build houses for veterans and disabled vets.WALLACE: I want to get into one...CLINTON: But, of course, there's no way we can know whether any of that is true, because he hasn't released his tax returns. He is the first candidate ever to run for president in the last 40-plus years who has not released his tax returns, so everything he says about charity or anything else, we can't prove it. You can look at our tax returns. We've got them all out there.But what is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate he has not paid a penny in federal income tax. And we were talking about immigrants a few minutes ago, Chris. You know, half of all immigrants -- undocumented immigrants in our country -- actually pay federal income tax. So we have undocumented immigrants in America who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire. I find that just astonishing.WALLACE: I want...TRUMP: So let me just tell you very quickly, we're entitled because of the laws that people like her passed to take massive amounts of depreciation on other charges, and we do it. And all of her donors -- just about all of them -- I know Buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars, Soros, George Soros, took hundreds of millions of dollars...WALLACE: We...TRUMP: Let me just explain.WALLACE: But, no, we heard this...TRUMP: Most of her donors have done the same thing as I do.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, we -- OK.TRUMP: You know what she should have done?WALLACE: Folks, we heard this...TRUMP: And you know, Hillary, what you should have done, you should have changed the law when you were a United States senator...WALLACE: Folks, we heard this...TRUMP: ... because your donors and your special interests are doing the same thing as I do, except even more so.CLINTON: Well, you know...TRUMP: You should have changed the law. But you won't change the law, because you take in so much money. I mean, I sat in my apartment today on a very beautiful hotel down the street known as Trump...CLINTON: Made with Chinese steel.TRUMP: But I will tell you, I sat there...(LAUGHTER)... I sat there watching ad after ad after ad, false ad. All paid for by your friends on Wall Street that gave so much money because they know you're going to protect them. And, frankly, you should have changed the laws.WALLACE: Mr. Trump...TRUMP: If you don't like what I did, you should have changed the laws.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, I want to ask you about one last question in this topic. You have been warning at rallies recently that this election is rigged and that Hillary Clinton is in the process of trying to steal it from you.Your running mate, Governor Pence, pledged on Sunday that he and you -- his words -- ""will absolutely accept the result of this election."" Today your daughter, Ivanka, said the same thing. I want to ask you here on the stage tonight: Do you make the same commitment that you will absolutely -- sir, that you will absolutely accept the result of this election?TRUMP: I will look at it at the time. I'm not looking at anything now. I'll look at it at the time.What I've seen -- what I've seen is so bad. First of all, the media is so dishonest and so corrupt, and the pile-on is so amazing. The New York Times actually wrote an article about it, but they don't even care. It's so dishonest. And they've poisoned the mind of the voters.But unfortunately for them, I think the voters are seeing through it. I think they're going to see through it. We'll find out on November 8th. But I think they're going to see through it.WALLACE: But, sir, there's...TRUMP: If you look -- excuse me, Chris -- if you look at your voter rolls, you will see millions of people that are registered to vote -- millions, this isn't coming from me -- this is coming from Pew Report and other places -- millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote.So let me just give you one other thing. So I talk about the corrupt media. I talk about the millions of people -- tell you one other thing. She shouldn't be allowed to run. It's crooked -- she's -- she's guilty of a very, very serious crime. She should not be allowed to run.And just in that respect, I say it's rigged, because she should never...WALLACE: But...TRUMP: Chris, she should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with e-mails and so many other things.WALLACE: But, sir, there is a tradition in this country -- in fact, one of the prides of this country -- is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard-fought a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner. Not saying that you're necessarily going to be the loser or the winner, but that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country. Are you saying you're not prepared now to commit to that principle?TRUMP: What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time. I'll keep you in suspense. OK?CLINTON: Well, Chris, let me respond to that, because that's horrifying. You know, every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is, is rigged against him.The FBI conducted a year-long investigation into my e-mails. They concluded there was no case; he said the FBI was rigged. He lost the Iowa caucus. He lost the Wisconsin primary. He said the Republican primary was rigged against him. Then Trump University gets sued for fraud and racketeering; he claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him. There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged against him.TRUMP: Should have gotten it.(LAUGHTER)CLINTON: This is -- this is a mindset. This is how Donald thinks. And it's funny, but it's also really troubling.WALLACE: OK.CLINTON: So that is not the way our democracy works. We've been around for 240 years. We've had free and fair elections. We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them. And that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election. You know, President Obama said the other day when you're whining before the game is even finished...(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Hold on. Hold on, folks. Hold on, folks.CLINTON: ... it just shows you're not up to doing the job. And let's -- you know, let's be clear about what he is saying and what that means. He is denigrating -- he's talking down our democracy. And I, for one, am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position.TRUMP: I think what the FBI did and what the Department of Justice did, including meeting with her husband, the attorney general, in the back of an airplane on the tarmac in Arizona, I think it's disgraceful. I think it's a disgrace.WALLACE: All right.TRUMP: I think we've never had a situation so bad in this country.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Hold on, folks. This doesn't do any good for anyone. Let's please continue the debate, and let's move on to the subject of foreign hot spots.The Iraqi offensive to take back Mosul has begun. If they are successful in pushing ISIS out of that city and out of all of Iraq, the question then becomes, what happens the day after? And that's something that whichever of you ends up -- whoever of you ends up as president is going to have to confront.Will you put U.S. troops into that vacuum to make sure that ISIS doesn't come back or isn't replaced by something even worse? Secretary Clinton, you go first in this segment. You have two minutes.CLINTON: Well, I am encouraged that there is an effort led by the Iraqi army, supported by Kurdish forces, and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other Americans on the ground. But I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force. I don't think that is in our interest, and I don't think that would be smart to do. In fact, Chris, I think that would be a big red flag waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself.The goal here is to take back Mosul. It's going to be a hard fight. I've got no illusions about that. And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa, which is the ISIS headquarters.I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real -- a really successful military operation. But we know we've got lots of work to do. Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war, aided and abetted by the Iranians and the Russians, continue.So I have said, look, we need to keep our eye on ISIS. That's why I want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home, why we have to go after them from the air, on the ground, online, why we have to make sure here at home we don't let terrorists buy weapons. If you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to buy a gun.And I'm going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, same question. If we are able to push ISIS out of Mosul and out of Iraq, will -- would you be willing to put U.S. troops in there to prevent their return or something else?TRUMP: Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad. We had Mosul. But when she left, when she took everybody out, we lost Mosul. Now we're fighting again to get Mosul. The problem with Mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of ISIS who they felt were in Mosul.About three months ago, I started reading that they want to get the leaders and they're going to attack Mosul. Whatever happened to the element of surprise, OK? We announce we're going after Mosul. I have been reading about going after Mosul now for about -- how long is it, Hillary, three months? These people have all left. They've all left.The element of surprise. Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country. So we're now fighting for Mosul, that we had. All she had to do was stay there, and now we're going in to get it.But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it? And the only reason they did it is because she's running for the office of president and they want to look tough. They want to look good. He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all the mistakes. That's why we have the great migration. But she wanted to look good for the election. So they're going in.But who's going to get Mosul, really? We'll take Mosul eventually. But the way -- if you look at what's happening, much tougher than they thought. Much, much tougher. Much more dangerous. Going to be more deaths that they thought.But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they're smart. They say, what do we need this for? So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing. And Iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupid -- the stupidest deal of all time, a deal that's going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons. Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much, because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq, something they've wanted to do forever, but we've made it so easy for them.So we're now going to take Mosul. And do you know who's going to be the beneficiary? Iran. Oh, yeah, they're making -- I mean, they are outsmarting -- look, you're not there, you might be involved in that decision. But you were there when you took everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq. You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it. You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but once you were in Iraq, you should have never left the way.WALLACE: Sir, your two minutes are up.TRUMP: The point is, the big winner is going to be Iran.CLINTON: Well, you know, once again, Donald is implying that he didn't support the invasion of Iraq. I said it was a mistake. I've said that years ago. He has consistently denied what is...TRUMP: Wrong.CLINTON: ... a very clear fact that...TRUMP: Wrong.CLINTON: ... before the invasion, he supported it. And, you know, I just want everybody to go Google it. Google ""Donald Trump Iraq."" And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq.TRUMP: Wrong.CLINTON: And you can actually hear the audio of him saying that. Now, why does that matter? Well, it matters because he has not told the truth about that position. I guess he believes it makes him look better now to contrast with me because I did vote for it.But what's really important here is to understand all the interplay. Mosul is a Sunni city. Mosul is on the border of Syria. And, yes, we do need to go after Baghdadi, and -- just like we went after bin Laden, while you were doing ""Celebrity Apprentice,"" and we brought him to justice. We need to go after the leadership.But we need to get rid of them, get rid of their fighters. There are an estimated several thousand fighters in Mosul. They've been digging underground. They've been prepared to defend. It's going to be tough fighting. But I think we can take back Mosul, and then we can move on into Syria and take back Raqqa.This is what we have to do. I'm just amazed that he seems to think that the Iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on Mosul to help me in this election, but that's how Donald thinks. You know, he always is looking for some conspiracy.TRUMP: Chris, we don't gain anything.CLINTON: He has all the conspiracy theories...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Iran is taking over Iraq.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, it's...TRUMP: Iran is taking over Iraq. We don't gain anything.CLINTON: This conspiracy theory, which he's been spewing out for quite some time.TRUMP: If they did it by surprise...(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Wait, wait, wait, Secretary Clinton, it's an open discussion.CLINTON: He says...TRUMP: We could have gained if they did it by surprise.WALLACE: Secretary, please let Mr. Trump speak.CLINTON: ... unfit, and he proves it every time he talks.TRUMP: No, you are the one that's unfit. You know, WikiLeaks just actually came out -- John Podesta said some horrible things about you, and, boy, was he right. He said some beauties. And you know, Bernie Sanders, he said you have bad judgment. You do.And if you think that going into Mosul after we let the world know we're going in, and all of the people that we really wanted -- the leaders -- they're all gone. If you think that was good, then you do. Now, John Podesta said you have terrible instincts. Bernie Sanders said you have bad judgment. I agree with both.CLINTON: Well, you should ask Bernie Sanders who he's supporting for president. And he has said...TRUMP: Which is a big mistake.CLINTON: ... as he has campaigned for me around the country, you are the most dangerous person to run for president in the modern history of America. I think he's right.WALLACE: Let's turn to Aleppo. Mr. Trump, in the last debate, you were both asked about the situation in the Syrian city of Aleppo. And I want to follow up on that, because you said several things in that debate which were not true, sir. You said that Aleppo has basically fallen. In fact, there -- in fact, there are... TRUMP: It's a catastrophe. I mean...WALLACE: It's a catastrophe, but there...TRUMP: ... it's a mess.WALLACE: There are a quarter of...TRUMP: Have you seen it? Have you seen it?WALLACE: Sir...TRUMP: Have you seen what's happening to Aleppo?WALLACE: Sir, if I may finish my question...TRUMP: OK, so it hasn't fallen. Take a look at it.WALLACE: Well, there are a quarter of a million people still living there and being slaughtered.TRUMP: That's right. And they are being slaughtered...WALLACE: Yes.TRUMP: ... because of bad decisions.WALLACE: If I may just finish here, and you also said that -- that Syria and Russia are busy fighting ISIS. In fact, they have been the ones who've been bombing and shelling eastern Aleppo, and they just announced a humanitarian pause, in effect, admitting that they have been bombing and shelling Aleppo. Would you like to clear that up, sir?TRUMP: Well, Aleppo is a disaster. It's a humanitarian nightmare. But it has fallen from the -- from any standpoint. I mean, what do you need, a signed document? Take a look at Aleppo. It is so sad when you see what's happened.And a lot of this is because of Hillary Clinton, because what's happened is, by fighting Assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought, and now she's going to say, oh, he loves Assad, she's -- he's just much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama. And everyone thought he was gone two years ago, three years ago. He -- he aligned with Russia.He now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful. We gave them $150 billion back. We give them $1.7 billion in cash. I mean, cash. Bundles of cash as big as this stage. We gave them $1.7 billion.Now they have -- he has aligned with Russia and with Iran. They don't want ISIS, but they have other things, because we're backing -- we're backing rebels. We don't know who the rebels are. We're giving them lots of money, lots of everything. We don't know who the rebels are. And when and if -- and it's not going to happen, because you have Russia and you have Iran now. But if they ever did overthrow Assad, you might end up with -- as bad as Assad is, and he's a bad guy, but you may very well end up with worse than Assad.If she did nothing, we'd be in much better shape. And this is what's caused the great migration, where she's taking in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, who probably in many cases -- not probably, who are definitely...WALLACE: Let me...TRUMP: ... in many cases, ISIS-aligned, and we now have them in our country, and wait until you see -- this is going to be the great Trojan horse. And wait until you see what happens in the coming years. Lots of luck, Hillary. Thanks a lot for doing a great job.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, you have talked about -- and in the last debate and again today -- that you would impose a no-fly zone to try to protect the people of Aleppo and to stop the killing there. President Obama has refused to do that because he fears it's going to draw us closer or deeper into the conflict.And General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says you impose a no-fly zone, chances are you're going to get into a war -- his words -- with Syria and Russia. So the question I have is, if you impose a no-fly zone -- first of all, how do you respond to their concerns? Secondly, if you impose a no-fly zone and a Russian plane violates that, does President Clinton shoot that plane down?CLINTON: Well, Chris, first of all, I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict. I'm well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general.This would not be done just on the first day. This would take a lot of negotiation. And it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground.We've had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated. So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS.But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees. He's made these claims repeatedly. I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in. But I am not going to slam the door on women and children. That picture of that little 4-year-old boy in Aleppo, with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance, is haunting. And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting. That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks. In fact, the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando, the Pulse nightclub, was born in Queens, the same place Donald was born. So let's be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it.And, yes, some of that threat emanates from over in Syria and Iraq, and we've got to keep fighting, and I will defeat ISIS, and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home.WALLACE: Folks, I want to get into our final segment.TRUMP: But I just have to...WALLACE: Real quick.TRUMP: It's so ridiculous what she -- she will defeat ISIS. We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place. And right now, they're in 32 countries.WALLACE: OK.TRUMP: We should have -- wait one second. They had a cease-fire three weeks ago. A cease-fire, the United States, Russia, and Syria. And during the cease-fire, Russia took over vast swatches of land, and then they said we don't want the cease-fire anymore.We are so outplayed on missiles, on cease-fires. They are outplayed. Now, she wasn't there. I assume she had nothing to do with it. But our country is so outplayed by Putin and Assad, and by the way -- and by Iran. Nobody can believe how stupid our leadership is.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton -- no, we need to move on to our final segment, and that is the national debt, which has not been discussed until tonight.Our national debt, as a share of the economy, our GDP, is now 77 percent. That's the highest since just after World War II. But the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says, Secretary Clinton, under your plan, debt would rise to 86 percent of GDP over the next 10 years. Mr. Trump, under your plan, they say it would rise to 105 percent of GDP over the next 10 years. The question is, why are both of you ignoring this problem? Mr. Trump, you go first.TRUMP: Well, I say they're wrong, because I'm going to create tremendous jobs. And we're bringing GDP from, really, 1 percent, which is what it is now, and if she got in, it will be less than zero. But we're bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent. And I actually think we can go higher than 4 percent. I think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent. And if we do, you don't have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine. We will have created a tremendous economic machine once again. To do that, we're taking back jobs. We're not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs, we don't make our product anymore. It's very sad. But I'm going to create a -- the kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry. We used to be there. We've given it up. We've become very, very sloppy.We've had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world, bigger than companies. You take these big companies, these trade deals are far bigger than these companies, and yet we don't use our great leaders, many of whom back me and many of whom back Hillary, I must say. But we don't use those people. Those are the people -- these are the greatest negotiators in the world. We have the greatest businesspeople in the world. We have to use them to negotiate our trade deals.We use political hacks. We use people that get the position because they gave -- they made a campaign contribution and they're dealing with China and people that are very much smarter than they are. So we have to use our great people.But that being said, we will create an economic machine the likes of which we haven't seen in many decades. And people, Chris, will again go back to work and they'll make a lot of money. And we'll have companies that will grow and expand and start from new.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, first, when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is ""Make America Great Again,"" I wonder when he thought America was great. And before he rushes and says, ""You know, before you and President Obama were there,"" I think it's important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades.You know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world. He was criticizing President Reagan. This is the way Donald thinks about himself, puts himself into, you know, the middle and says, ""You know, I alone can fix it,"" as he said on the convention stage.But if you look at the debt, which is the issue you asked about, Chris, I pay for everything I'm proposing. I do not add a penny to the national debt. I take that very seriously, because I do think it's one of the issues we've got to come to grips with.So when I talk about how we're going to pay for education, how we're going to invest in infrastructure, how we're going to get the cost of prescription drugs down, and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time, I've made it very clear we are going where the money is. We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share.And there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth. In fact, I think just the opposite. We'll have what economists call middle-out growth. We've got to get back to rebuilding the middle class, the families of America. That's where growth will come from. That's why I want to invest in you. I want to invest in your family.And I think that's the smartest way to grow the economy, to make the economy fairer. And we just have a big disagreement about this. It may be because of our experiences. You know, he started off with his dad as a millionaire...TRUMP: Yeah, yeah, we've heard -- we've heard this before, Hillary.CLINTON: I started off with -- my dad was a small-business man.TRUMP: We've heard this before.CLINTON: And I think it -- you know, it's a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy.WALLACE: Time.TRUMP: Thank you, Hillary. Could I just respond?WALLACE: Well, no, sir, because we're running out of time...TRUMP: Because I did disagree with Ronald Reagan very strongly on trade. I disagreed with him. We should have been much tougher on trade even then. I've been waiting for years. Nobody does it right.WALLACE: OK.TRUMP: And frankly, now we're going to do it right.WALLACE: All right. The one last area I want to get into with you in this debate is the fact that the biggest driver of our debt is entitlements, which is 60 percent of all federal spending. Now, the Committee for federal -- a Responsible Federal Budget has looked at both of your plans and they say neither of you has a serious plan that is going to solve the fact that Medicare's going to run out of money in the 2020s, Social Security is going to run out of money in the 2030s, and at that time, recipients are going to take huge cuts in their benefits.So, in effect, the final question I want to ask you in this regard is -- and let me start with you, Mr. Trump, would President Trump make a deal to save Medicare and Social Security that included both tax increases and benefit cuts, in effect, a grand bargain on entitlements?TRUMP: I'm cutting taxes. We're going to grow the economy. It's going to grow at a record rate of growth.WALLACE: That's not going to help in the entitlements.TRUMP: No, it's going to totally help you. And one thing we have to do: Repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. It's destroying our country. It's destroying our businesses, our small business and our big businesses. We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.You take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year '17, it is a disaster. If we don't repeal and replace -- now, it's probably going to die of its own weight. But Obamacare has to go. It's -- the premiums are going up 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent. Next year they're going to go up over 100 percent.And I'm really glad that the premiums have started -- at least the people see what's happening, because she wants to keep Obamacare and she wants to make it even worse, and it can't get any worse. Bad health care at the most expensive price. We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.WALLACE: And, Secretary Clinton, same question, because at this point, Social Security and Medicare are going to run out, the trust funds are going to run out of money. Will you as president entertain -- will you consider a grand bargain, a deal that includes both tax increases and benefit cuts to try to save both programs?CLINTON: Well, Chris, I am on record as saying that we need to put more money into the Social Security Trust Fund. That's part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy. My Social Security payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald's, assuming he can't figure out how to get out of it. But what we want to do is to replenish the Social Security Trust Fund...TRUMP: Such a nasty woman.CLINTON: ... by making sure that we have sufficient resources, and that will come from either raising the cap and/or finding other ways to get more money into it. I will not cut benefits. I want to enhance benefits for low-income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current Social Security system.But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt. That will have dire consequences for Social Security and Medicare.And I'll say something about the Affordable Care Act, which he wants to repeal. The Affordable Care Act extended the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund. So if repeals it, our Medicare problem gets worse. What we need to do is go after...TRUMP: Your husband disagrees with you.CLINTON: ... the long-term health care drivers. We've got to get costs down, increase value, emphasize wellness. I have a plan for doing that. And I think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control by with more resources and harder decisions.WALLACE: This is -- this is the final time, probably to both of your delight, that you're going to be on a stage together in this campaign. I would like to end it on a positive note. You had not agreed to closing statements, but it seems to me in a funny way that might make it more interesting because you haven't prepared closing statements.So I'd like you each to take -- and we're going to put a clock up, a minute, as the final question in the final debate, to tell the American people why they should elect you to be the next president. This is another new mini-segment. Secretary Clinton, it's your turn to go first.CLINTON: Well, I would like to say to everyone watching tonight that I'm reaching out to all Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, and independents -- because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be, to grow the economy, to make it fairer, to make it work for everyone. We need your talents, your skills, your commitments, your energy, your ambition.You know, I've been privileged to see the presidency up close. And I know the awesome responsibility of protecting our country and the incredible opportunity of working to try to make life better for all of you. I have made the cause of children and families really my life's work.That's what my mission will be in the presidency. I will stand up for families against powerful interests, against corporations. I will do everything that I can to make sure that you have good jobs, with rising incomes, that your kids have good educations from preschool through college. I hope you will give me a chance to serve as your president.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, thank you.Mr. Trump?TRUMP: She's raising the money from the people she wants to control. Doesn't work that way.But when I started this campaign, I started it very strongly. It's called ""Make America Great Again."" We're going to make America great. We have a depleted military. It has to be helped, has to be fixed. We have the greatest people on Earth in our military. We don't take care of our veterans. We take care of illegal immigrants, people that come into the country illegally, better than we take care of our vets. That can't happen.Our policemen and women are disrespected. We need law and order, but we need justice, too. Our inner cities are a disaster. You get shot walking to the store. They have no education. They have no jobs. I will do more for African-Americans and Latinos than she can ever do in 10 lifetimes.All she's done is talk to the African-Americans and to the Latinos, but they get the vote, and then they come back, they say, we'll see you in four years. We are going to make America strong again, and we are going to make America great again, and it has to start now. We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her.WALLACE: Thank you both.(APPLAUSE)Secretary Clinton -- hold on just a moment, folks. Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump, I want to thank you both for participating in all three of these debates.That brings to an end this year's debates sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. We want to thank the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and its students for having us. Now the decision is up to you.While millions have already voted, Election Day, November 8th, is just 20 days away. One thing everyone here can agree on: We hope you will go vote. It is one of the honors and obligations of living in this great country. Thank you, and good night.1 of 20"	1.0
http://www.politifact.com/oregon/statements/2011/nov/14/rob-cornilles/another-look-favorite-republican-talking-point/	"	Says Suzanne Bonamici ""supports the $500 billion cut to Medicare passed last year."""	false	['Health Care', 'Medicare']	http://www.politifact.com/	http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/20/60-plus-association/medicare-cuts-health-care-law-will-hurt-seniors-sa/	2011/11/14	"The new health care law ""will cut $500 billion from Medicare. That will hurt the quality of our care.""— 60 Plus Association on Wednesday, September 8th, 2010 in a campaign adMedicare 'cuts' in the health care law will hurt seniors, says 60 Plus AssociationBy Angie Drobnic Holan on Monday, September 20th, 2010 at 3:23 p.m.The conservative 60 Plus Association has run similar ads against Democratic members of Congress.Guess which member of Congress ""betrayed"" seniors by voting in favor of the 2010 health care law, a vote for ""Nancy Pelosi's health care bill which will cut $500 billion from Medicare"" and ""hurt the quality of our care.""Which member is it? Well, lots of them, according to the 60 Plus Association. The advocacy group bills itself as ""a conservative alternative to the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP)"" and supports"" a free-enterprise, less -government, less-taxes approach to seniors issues."" It has created substantially similar ads to run against Democratic members of Congress in districts around the country.In Florida, the group is targeting Rep. Allen Boyd, who represents the Panhandle area, and Reps. Alan Grayson and Suzanne Kosmas, both from central Florida. It is also running ads against Wisconsin members Steve Kagen, representing Green Bay and Appleton, and Ron Kind of western Wisconsin. Another target is John Boccieri of Canton, Ohio. Still other ads target House members from Arizona, New York, Indiana and Pennsylvania.It's true that all of these members of Congress voted in favor of the new health care law when it came up for a vote on March 21, 2010. But the ad gives a highly misleading impression about funding for Medicare.Here's the text of the ad running against Boyd, the Florida congressman who represents the northwest Panhandle area:""Alan Boyd has betrayed Florida's seniors. Instead of voting to protect us, he supported Nancy Pelosi's liberal agenda. Boyd voted for Nancy Pelosi's health care bill which will cut $500 billion from Medicare. That will hurt the quality of our care. ... Florida's seniors can send Alan Boyd a message. He betrayed us, and this November, we'll remember.""Because of our previous fact-checks on the health care law, we knew this ad was leaving out important details on how the health care law, formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, changed Medicare.Medicare, a government-run health insurance program, provides health care coverage for the vast majority of Americans over age 65. It accounts for about 12 percent of the federal budget.It's important to note that the law does not take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget. Rather, the bill attempts to slow the program's future growth, curtailing just over $500 billion in future spending over the next 10 years. Medicare spending will still increase -- the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009.Next, we wanted to address how those reductions are expected to affect the quality of care.""Some (changes) increase Medicare spending to improve benefits and coverage,"" said Tricia Neuman, director of the Medicare Policy Project at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. ""Other provisions reduce the growth in Medicare spending to help the program operate more efficiently and help fund coverage expansions to the uninsured in the underlying health reform legislation. Other provisions are designed to improve the delivery of care and quality of care.""Neuman walked through the changes in an easily digestible tutorial on the Kaiser Family Foundation's website , a good non-ideological explanation for people interested in changes to Medicare under health care reform.Some of the savings are for relatively minor programs, such as $36 billion for increases in premiums for higher-income beneficiaries and $12 billion for administrative changes. The law directs a new national board to identify $15.5 billion in savings, but the board -- the Independent Payment Advisory Board -- is prohibited from proposing anything that would ration care or reduce or modify benefits.More significantly, there's also $136 billion in projected savings that would come from changes to the Medicare Advantage program. About 25 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan.Let's back-up for a minute and explain Medicare Advantage: There are two basic ways most people get Medicare coverage. They enroll in traditional Medicare and a prescription drug plan through the government and maybe buy a supplemental policy to cover most out-of-pocket costs. Or they enroll in Medicare Advantage programs (they include drug plans), which are run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage programs typically have more generous benefits such as dental and vision coverage. Some plans even pay the patient’s monthly Medicare premium, which can amount to about $100.The Medicare Advantage program was intended to bring more efficiency from the private sector to the Medicare program, but it hasn't worked as planned. A June 2009 analysis from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission said that the Advantage programs costs taxpayers on average of 14 percent more than the traditional Medicare plan. President Barack Obama has said repeatedly that the Medicare Advantage plan wastes public money that could be put to better use.The health care law that President Obama signed in March phases out extra payments for Medicare Advantage programs over the next three to six years to bring their costs in line with traditional Medicare and institutes other rules for the program.""How these payment changes will affect beneficiaries remains to be seen -- but is expected to vary across the country,"" Neuman said. ""The Congressional Budget Office projects the law will result in fewer enrollees in Medicare Advantage plans, and fewer extra benefits for Medicare Advantage enrollees, on average. It is also possible that the number of plans available to beneficiaries will decline -- which may or may not be a concern. On average, Medicare beneficiaries have 30 plans available to them in 2010.""PolitiFact has waded into this argument about whether the adjustments to the Medicare Advantage option constitute a cut before . Most experts we talked to had the same answer: yes and no.On one hand, they might not be considered cuts because nowhere in the bill are benefits actually eliminated, experts said. And other parts of the bill expand coverage for seniors and ultimately make some components of Medicare less expensive for patients. (More on this in a bit.)Still, changes could be in store for Medicare Advantage participants, especially the extra benefits that people receive under Advantage, experts said. But basic benefits that mirror regular Medicare will stay the same.Finally, there's $220 billion in Medicare savings achieved by reducing annual increases in payments health care providers would otherwise receive from Medicare. The reductions are part of programs intended to improve care and make it more efficient, such as reducing payments for preventable hospital re-admissions. These adjustments are aimed at hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and home health agencies.The Office of the Actuary for Medicare and Medicaid Services questioned in an April 2010 report whether these levels of savings are realistic, saying that some health care providers would become unprofitable if payments were reduced. (The 60 Plus ad cites this report in its fine print.) The actuary's report suggests that Congress will intervene to change the payment formula to avoid health care providers dropping out of Medicare.The report also includes this caveat about how difficult it is to project the effects of the health care law: ""The legislation would result in numerous changes in the way that health care insurance is provided and paid for in the U.S., and the scope and magnitude of these changes are such that few precedents exist for use in estimation. Consequently, the estimates presented here are subject to a substantially greater degree of uncertainty than is usually the case with more routine health care legislation.""Finally, the 60 Plus ad also fails to mention new benefits for seniors under the health care law, such as a $250 rebate for prescription drugs purchased through Medicare Part D. (A statement on the 60 Plus website calls the drug rebate ""the senior suckup."") Currently, after an initial benefit period, enrollees are required to pay 100 percent of their prescription drug costs until they reach a level of catastrophic coverage. The rebate is meant to begin to close what is often called the doughnut hole in prescription drug coverage for beneficiaries. By 2020, Medicare will pay 75 percent of the total cost of generic prescription drug coverage in the gap, a marked improvement to the current program.Getting back to the Truth-O-Meter, the 60 Plus ad says that the new health care law ""will cut $500 billion from Medicare. That will hurt the quality of our care."" The ad loses points for accuracy because the $500 billion aren't actual cuts but reductions to future spending for a program that will still grow significantly in the next 10 years. The ad also says those cuts will ""hurt the quality"" of seniors' care. But we find that to be a highly contentious subject, and the 60 Plus ad doesn't hint at any of the ways that the reductions are ways to make Medicare more efficient. Finally, the ad doesn't mention any of the benefits to seniors, such as improved prescription drug coverage. The ad seems more intent on attacking the health care law than accurately describing this complicated piece of legislation. Because it leaves critical facts out of its description in a way that gives a misleading impression, we rate the statement Barely True.Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.Advertisement"	1.0

(Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)Last month, The Washington Post reported that white nationalists have begun using Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump as a recruitment tool.Now, the polarizing Republican presidential front-runner has become the recruitment fodder for another group of marginalized extremists.A propaganda video released by the Somali-based al-Qaeda affiliate al-Shabab includes a clip of Trump calling on the United States to bar Muslims from entering the country, according to news reports. Trump made the statement following the Islamic State-inspired shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., last month.The video was produced to look similar to a documentary and calls upon African Americans to join a holy war against the United States, according to the BBC .[ Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Donald Trump ‘is ISIS’s greatest triumph’ ]Claiming the United States is a hotbed of racial inequality, police brutality and anti-Muslim sentiment, the film is an indictment of U.S. race relations and also includes historical civil rights-era footage of Malcolm X, an unnamed white supremacist and African Americans in prison, according to CNN .3) New #Shabaab vid shows #Trump proposing Muslim travel ban & Awlaki predicting bigotry & ""concentration camps"" pic.twitter.com/2KMpzYf3ui— Rita Katz (@Rita_Katz) January 1, 2016The clip showing Trump, the BBC noted, arrives 10 minutes into the 51-minute propaganda video.On either side of the Trump footage, NBC reported , are clips of Anwar al-Awlaki, the late al-Qaeda recruiter, urging Muslims in the United States to move to Islamic countries or wage war against the West at home. A U.S. citizen, al-Awlaki was killed in a drone strike carried out in Yemen in 2011.“Yesterday, America was a land of slavery, segregation, lynching and Ku Klux Klan, and tomorrow, it will be a land of religious discrimination and concentration camps,” Awlaki can be heard saying in recorded footage.He adds: “The West will eventually turn against its Muslim citizens.”The al-Kataib Media Foundation released the video on Twitter on Friday, according to NBC.Trump’s campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But Saturday afternoon, news of the video did nothing to dim the ardor of supporters gathering for his rally in Biloxi, Miss. They began lining up seven hours before the candidate was scheduled to speak, and they utterly rejected the premise that Trump was providing grist for propagandists.Some wondered whether the video was real. More insisted that the al-Qaeda affiliate was attacking Trump out of fear.“ISIS, Al-Shabaad, al-Qaeda, all those groups — they don’t want Trump in office,” said Richard Coyne, 52, an Army veteran from nearby Gulfport, who retired last year. “They want the status quo, which is unfortunately pro-ISIS, pro-Al-Qaeda, pro-Muslim.” ISIS is another name for the extremist group Islamic State.Sarah Anderson, 57, of Hattiesburg, also an Army veteran who had once worked at the checkpoint at the Berlin Wall, said that any terrorist group that cited Trump was doing so because it is “scared to death of him.”“He’s a threat to them,” she said. “That’s the opposite of promoting what the terrorists want.”Some voters were unaware of the video but well aware that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had warned of Trump’s rhetoric being promoted to recruit terrorists. Tom Simmons, a 68-year-old Vietnam War veteran from nearby Vancleave, was reminded of a time 45 years ago when liberals worried so much about winning hearts and minds that they did not do what was necessary for victory.“I can’t comprehend anything that the Democrats say,” Simmons said. “The terrorists fear Trump right now. They’re going to do anything they can to make him look ridiculous and sound ridiculous.”In controversial remarks made after the San Bernardino attack, Trump called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.”[ Donald Trump would strongly consider closing some mosques in the United States ]The propaganda video includes that line, but bleeps out the word “hell,” according to CNN.In the wake of the Paris attacks, Trump said he would “strongly consider” shutting down some mosques and heavily surveilling others.“I would hate to do it, but it’s something that you’re going to have to strongly consider because some of the ideas and some of the hatred — the absolute hatred — is coming from these areas,” Trump said in an interview on “Morning Joe.”Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is saying Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton lied about him at Saturday's debate and is demanding an apology. (ABC News/NBC News)The video arrives on the heels of several heated exchanges between Trump and Hillary Clinton, in which Clinton has claimed Trump’s language aids jihadists.“If you go on Arabic television, as we have, and you look at what is being blasted out — video of Mr Trump being translated to Arabic,” Clinton said at an Iowa town hall last month. “ ‘No Muslims coming to the United States,’ other kinds of derogatory, defamatory statements — it is playing into the hands of the violent jihadists.”Trump’s comments, Clinton added, “lights an even bigger fire for them to make their propaganda claims through social media and in other ways.”[ Hillary Clinton revises contested claims about Islamic State recruiters using Donald Trump video ]Trump responded to Clinton’s assertion by calling her “a liar.”“It’s just another Hillary lie,” Trump said on NBC News’s “Meet the Press” late last month. “She’s a liar, and everybody knows that.”David Weigel contributed to this report from Biloxi, Miss.MORE READING:"	1.0

Latin American drug gangs have invaded every city of significant size in the United States. Phoenix is already one of the kidnapping capitals of the world, and though the states on the U.S./Mexico border may be the first places in the nation to suffer from cartel violence, by no means are they the last.The president flagrantly defies the 2006 federal law ordering the construction of a secure border fence along the entire Mexican border. So the border today remains porous not only to people seeking jobs in the U.S., but to criminals whose jobs are murder, rape, robbery and kidnapping. Ominously, the border also remains open to agents of al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations. Numerous intelligence sources have confirmed that foreign terrorists have identified the southern U.S. border as their path of entry into the country.When the next terrorist attack comes, the Obama administration won’t accept responsibility. Instead, it will do what it does every time: blame a scapegoat and count on Obama’s “mainstream” media enablers to go along.A heinous act of mass murder—either by terrorists or by some psychotic who should have been locked up long ago—will be the pretext to unleash a tsunami of gun control.No wonder Americans are buying guns in record numbers right now, while they still can and before their choice about which firearm is right for their family is taken away forever.After Hurricane Sandy, we saw the hellish world that the gun prohibitionists see as their utopia. Looters ran wild in south Brooklyn. There was no food, water or electricity. And if you wanted to walk several miles to get supplies, you better get back before dark, or you might not get home at all.Anti-gun New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg had already done everything he could to prevent law-abiding New Yorkers from owning guns, and he has made sure that no ordinary citizen will ever be allowed to carry a gun. He even refused to allow the National Guard into the city to restore civil order because Guardsmen carry guns!Meanwhile, President Obama is leading this country to financial ruin, borrowing over a trillion dollars a year for phony “stimulus” spending and other payoffs for his political cronies. Nobody knows if or when the fiscal collapse will come, but if the country is broke, there likely won’t be enough money to pay for police protection. And the American people know it.Hurricanes. Tornadoes. Riots. Terrorists. Gangs. Lone criminals. These are perils we are sure to face—not just maybe. It’s not paranoia to buy a gun. It’s survival. It’s responsible behavior, and it’s time we encourage law-abiding Americans to do just that.Since the election, millions of Americans have been lining up in front of gun stores, Cabela’s and Bass Pro Shops exercising their freedom while they still have it. They are demonstrating they have a mass determination to buy, own and use firearms. Millions of Americans are using market forces like never before to demonstrate their ardent support for our firearm freedoms. That’s one of the very best ways we can Stand And Fight.Inevitably, the anti-gun media and the gun-ban lobbies are demonizing the purchase of firearms. They call us “extremists” because we wonder whether we will be able to buy a semi-auto in three years or, even in some states, later this year. That’s despite the fact that President Obama long ago made clear that he wants to ban them all!The media try to make rank-and-file Americans feel guilty about buying a gun. The enemies of freedom demonize gun buyers and portray us as social lepers. But we know the truth. We know that responsible gun ownership exemplifies what is good and right about America.Responsible Americans realize that the world as we know it has changed. We, the American people, clearly see the daunting forces we will undoubtedly face: terrorists, crime, drug gangs, the possibility of Euro-style debt riots, civil unrest or natural disaster.Gun owners are not buying firearms because they anticipate a confrontation with the government. Rather, we anticipate confrontations where the government isn’t there—or simply doesn’t show up in time.To preserve the inalienable, individual human right to keep and bear arms—to withstand the siege that is coming—the NRA is building a four-year communications and resistance movement. The enemies of the Second Amendment will be met with unprecedented defiance, commitment and determination. We will Stand And Fight.First, we are going to devise legal capability like never before. I fervently hope that President Obama does not get to appoint another anti-gun Supreme Court justice like Sonia Sotomayor or Elena Kagan. But he probably will, and we must meet that challenge. His chances of appointing a replacement for one of the five pro-rights justices in the 5-4 Heller and McDonald majorities are high. And there’s no doubt he is going to appoint a huge number of new judges to lifetime positions in the lower federal courts.YOUR GUN RIGHTS ARE UNDER CONSTANT ATTACK!There has never been a more important time to join the NRA and now Daily Caller readers can enjoy special pricing and benefits.	1.0

We'll talk with the owner of the town's biggest hotels and casinos, Steve Wynn, who decided a year ago, Las Vegas was a soft target.STEVE WYNN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, WYNN RESORTS: We profile or inspect or examine everybody that enters the building.WALLACE: Steve Wynn, only on ""Fox News Sunday.""And then, even gun rights advocates are calling to revoke bump stock, like the Las Vegas gunman used to make his automatic weapons fire faster.REP. PAUL RYAN, R-WIS., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Fully automatic weapons have been outlawed for many, many years. This seems to be a way of going around that.WALLACE (on camera): Is this the start of sweeping gun control? We'll ask Chris Cox, executive director of the National Rifle Association.Plus, as President Trump decides to decertify the Iran nuclear deal, his, his secretary of state denies he is considered quitting.REX TILLERSON, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: The vice president has never had to persuade me to remain the secretary of state because I have never considered leaving this post.DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We must put an end to Iran's continued aggression and nuclear ambitions.WALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday panel about the relationship between the president and Rex Tillerson as they weigh on a major policy change.And our power player of the week, a professional football player goes out of this world to make a difference.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My perspective shifted, I wanted to come home and really help inspire that next generation.WALLACE: All, right now, on ""Fox News Sunday.""(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: And hello again from Fox News in Washington.We'll get the latest from the investigation into the Las Vegas mass shooting in a moment with a live report, but we begin with breaking news. Hurricane Nate made landfall early this morning striking Biloxi, Mississippi, with rain and winds of 85 miles per hour, causing flooding and power outages. Nate has now been downgraded to a tropical storm.Let's get the latest on Nate's path. Chief meteorologist Rick Reichmuth is in the Fox Weather Center in New York -- Rick.RICK REICHMUTH, FOX NEWS CHIEF METEOROLOGIST: Hi, Chris.Yes, the fourth hurricane to make landfall in the U.S. this hurricane season, which is quite remarkable. Taking a look at the satellite picture, you can see it moved onshore. It still is moving very quickly, which is great news. It means it's not going to sit in any one spot, and allow it to rain for that long.So, the flooding won't be as bad as it could have been. That said, over time, this is going to pull up in across parts of the Tennessee Valley, Ohio Valley, and eventually, across parts of the Northeast because it's interacting with a cold front coming in. It's going to bring a lot of moisture out.So, this is the future radar. Throughout the day today, rain moving in the North Georgia mountains, Tennessee Valley, in toward the Central Appalachia, during the overnight hours. And by tomorrow, all of that moisture moves in across parts of the Northeast. So, a very wet start to the week and a wet commute to the day tomorrow as well.But take a look at this -- overall rainfall totals are going to be extreme. Some spots potentially up to 10 inches, far inland from the storm. That means flooding could be widespread especially across parts of the central and southern Appalachians -- Chris.WALLACE: Rick, thank you.Now to Las Vegas where investigators are still looking for a motive into why Stephen Paddock open fire on a crowd last Sunday night, killing 58 people and wounding almost 500.Will Carr is live in Las Vegas with the latest -- Will.WILL CARR, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Chris, authorities say, as Stephen Paddock was perched on the 30-second floor of Mandalay Bay, he left a note on his nightstand. Now, ""60 Minutes"" reporting that note had calculations so he could maximize his accuracy as he fired down upon the crowd. And when that happened, thousands scattered, people raced over in this direction, they physically pushed down this fence and then they ran over unto airport property, trying to get to safety.And while questions continue to swirl around motive, authorities are putting out billboards across town, asking for help. There are also reports that the FBI is starting to believe Paddock had severe mental illness that went undiagnosed.Fifty-eight people were killed in the attacks, almost 500 injured before Paddock shot and killed himself. Investigators are continuing to question Paddock's girlfriend, Marilou Danley. We've learned the couple traveled and went on at least a dozen cruises.As the investigation continues, this community continues to try to heal. Vice President Mike Pence took part in a community prayer walk on Saturday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We do more with those who mourn and grieve with those who grieve, but we do not grieve like those who have no hope, because heroes give us hope.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)CARR: Along those lines, a carpenter drove into town from Chicago and he put up 58 wooden crosses, on each cross is a victim's picture and their name. Really a touching reminder of all the people's lives that were lost -- Chris.WALLACE: Will Carr reporting from Las Vegas -- Will, thanks.The Las Vegas massacre raises new questions about how to prevent these attacks.Joining me now for an exclusive interview, one of the giants of Las Vegas, Steve Wynn, chief executive of Wynn Resorts, who's been thinking about this problem for a long time.Steve, it was over a year ago when you said that Las Vegas was a target city and you were going to harden your hotels and casinos. What did you do?WYNN: Actually, it was two years ago Thanksgiving, and I got every consultant and adviser I can think of to come through from a Ray Kelly to the people from Seal Team 6. It took us from Thanksgiving until May to develop and institute and recruit a program of counterterrorism and it will be two years this May.WALLACE: And --WYNN: It started in 2015.WALLACE: And without going into great detail, what kind of things do you have on your facilities?WYNN: Basically we had to recruit and expand security by tens of millions of dollars to cover every entrance, to retrain the entire workforce, from housekeeping and room service, and people are in the tower and observing people. We had to cover every exit and every aspect of the building to see if we could identify and preempt any kind of terroristic or violent action.It is never perfect, of course, but what you can do to use local vernacular, you can change the odds, I guess.WALLACE: So, given all of that -- and I know that you had a hidden metal detectors and you had profilers in your casinos, watching the people walking in and out -- would any of those measures have prevented Steven Paddock from checking in to one of your hotels instead of the Mandalay Bay to have brought in these suitcases carrying his arsenal, a couple of suitcases at that time, checking in to a room on a high floor, knocking out the window and raining terror down on people below?WYNN: Well, I know that my friends at MGM are particularly fastidious about trying to protect their employees and their guests. Having said that, there are a couple of things in retrospect and it's always good to look over your shoulder on these things. But we have a routine with housekeeping, with room service, with audio visual, who anybody that goes in the room to do an inspection.We also have rules about do not disturb. If a room goes on ""do not disturb"" for more than 12 hours, we investigate. We constantly -- we don't allow guns in this building unless they're being carried by our employees and there's a lot of them. But if anybody's got a gun and we find them continually, we eject them from the hotel.WALLACE: So, if he had suitcases carrying these automatic -- or semi-automatic weapons, would you have been able to spot that if they were in the suitcases being carried up to his room?WYNN: Well, we certainly wouldn't invade the privacy of a guest in a room. But let's put it this way, the scenario that we're aware of would have indicated that he didn't let anyone in the room for two or three days, that would have trigger a whole bunch of alarms here. And we would have -- on behalf of the guests, of course, investigated for safety and it would have been provocative situation.I'm sure that the same is true in other hotels but in this hotel, a 36-hour, a 24-hour, 36-hour ""do not disturb"" one of room is a predicate for investigation.WALLACE: After the shooting last weekend, you started having security at the entrances to your hotels, wand people, wand -- inspect bags being brought in, are you going to keep doing that? And with 20/20 hindsight the benefit there, have you thought of new measures that you're going to take to try to prevent another one of these massacres from happening using one of the Wynn Resorts as a perch to fire down on thousands of people on the street below?WYNN: Well, if I can clear the record, we have been guarding the doors for two years every single day, 24 hours a day. We have magnetometers at any place, at every employee entrance, and at every place of human collection like the night clubs. We don't wand the people at the door. That's not necessary.We profile or inspect or examine everybody that enters the building. And under most circumstances, it's unnecessary to wand people or to do any kind of invasive procedure. The things we're looking for that represent potential threats are much more obvious and allow us a great deal of freedom in allowing us to not interfere with the normal flow of people in and out of the building, which is close to 15,000 or 20,000 people a day.WALLACE: I understand that Stephen Paddock had gambled and stayed at your properties along with a lot of other places along the Strip. I know you talked to your security team afterwards.Looking back, after talking to all of them, how much of a profile did you have on him? And was there anything in that profile that should have raise a red flag?WYNN: It's an interesting question. He's been staying in Las Vegas since '06. So, you know, we're talking about 11 years, with his girlfriend or at least in recent years. Frequent visitor, once or twice a month to this hotel and others.The most vanilla profile one could possibly imagine. A modest gambler at least by our standards, you know, nothing serious, paid promptly, never owed any money anywhere in Las Vegas. He didn't fit the profile of a problem or a compulsive gambler.What was -- if there was anything interesting that we discovered in the years of service and we have butlers and waiters and masseuses and the people in the beauty shop that know this woman and this man completely. They talk about normal mundane things. But if there's anything interesting that stood out over the six years, nobody that's ever worked here have ever seen the gentleman or the lady take a drink of wine, beer or alcohol of any kind.Now, a lot of people don't drink. But considering their frequency of all the restaurants, and their behavior as normal tourist taking advantage of everything that's available in our resort, they never ever imbibed in any liquor. Their behavior was conservative, private, understated in every way. You never ever would stop a man like this coming in, you know, in the building.However, nobody in this company's history, no public person has ever walked in the service elevator unless they were accompanied by a security. That wouldn't happen. Secondly --WALLACE: Did he go on a service elevator, Steve?WYNN: I'm just saying anything like that. I'm not sure whether he did, but nobody ever goes in the back of the house unaccompanied by security.But another thing, being in a room for three days in a ""do not disturb"" situation, that would have triggered an alarm here, and would have considered -- what have been considered as a potentially dangerous thing from the guest's point of view that maybe the person was ill. And we would want to inspect and see that they were safe. We go into their room. We'd want to know more about anybody who was sequestered in a room for more than 12 hours. That would be -- that would be something that would -- our people have been trained too look out for.So, Chris --WALLACE: Steve, you and I have known each other for some years. You are very smart man who knows almost everything, has seen almost every aspect of human conduct, do you have a theory, do you have an instinct for the big question: why Steven Paddock did what he did?WYNN: No. No. But I have this feeling, Chris. This is a man who behaves rationally, privately, a little introverted, liked to play video poker. But he was a rational man. And every historical review of his behavior indicates that he was a rational man, so was his girlfriend. And yet, he prepared over an extended period of time, a totally irrational act.Now, this sounds like someone either totally demented -- a behavior which he never evidenced -- or someone who's sending a message. This is a plan. We don't know what that message is or if there is one, but this behavior, according to my employees, is as stunning as unexpected as anybody, any of them have ever met.And that's the status, you know, that I hear from the sheriff, and watching television that seems to be the moment -- the momentary analysis of this situation. I really don't have anything to add to that.WALLACE: Steven Wynn, thank you. Thank for you time. And we'll be watching how you and the rest of Las Vegas respond to this terrible tragedy. Thanks again, sir.WYNN: We'll be fine. We'll be fine. The president did a good job.WALLACE: Up next, after still another mass shooting, the debate over gun control re-ignites. But this time, even the National Riffle Association is calling for more regulation. We'll talk with the NRA's executive director when we come right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: In the wake of last Sunday's mass murder in Las Vegas, we all followed an all-too-familiar pattern: shocked, questions, and calls for more gun control. Most of us also learned about a device, bump stock, that allow rifles to fire faster. And now, even some of the strongest advocates of gun rights are calling for more regulation.Joining me here is Chris Cox, executive director of the National Rifle Association.Mr. Cox, welcome to ""Fox News Sunday.""CHRIS COX, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION: Thanks, Chris.WALLACE: The NRA surprised a lot of people this week, calling for ATF to review bump stocks.Here is part of your statement. Let's put it on the screen: The NRA believes devices designed to allow semiautomatic rifles to function like fully automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations.This regulation had been on the books for seven years, why is the NRA suddenly concerned, and what specifically would you like to see ATF do?COX: Well, what we called for was ATF to review any device changes semiautomatics to function like fully automatics. As you probably know, it's illegal to convert a semiautomatic to fully automatic. ATF did approve this under Barack Obama.And what the National Rifle Association has said is ATF needs to do their job, review these, and if there's a further regulation, then we'll work on further regulation. But, Chris, what we saw last week was pure evil, and we've seen evil existed in this country. We've seen box cutters in airplanes, cars, bombs, trucks full of explosives, and yes firearms.So, as we have this conversation, we need to look at the broader picture. We need to have an honest discussion about what works and what doesn't work, and our concern is that all this focus on devices takes away the attention from the underlying behavior. And until we address that, these things are going to continue to happen.WALLACE: Well, let's just talk about the underlying behavior. You're the NRA, so we're going to talk to you about the specific technique. Would you be OK with banning bump stocks?COX: Well, we don't believe that bans have ever worked on anything. What we've said has been very clear, that if something transfers a semiautomatic to function like a fully automatic, then it ought to be regulated differently. Fully automatics are regulated differently in this country. If something copies a semiautomatic into a fully automatic, then those should be related as well.WALLACE: Did you get any blowback from some of your members? Because it's unusual for the NRA, after one of these incidents to call for more regulation of either guns or parts of guns.COX: There were NRA members at that concert. There were NRA members that were shot at that concert, and NRA members that were murdered at that concert. So, what we're getting from NRA members is grief and fear, the same way Americans are grieving and scared that something like this might happen again.So, will there be disagreement over policy discussions? Of course. There's an ongoing discussion of gun control in this country. We had it during the debates last year. We had it throughout the campaign when the most pro-gun control candidate was defeated by the most pro-Second Amendment candidate.These conversations happened. What we are concerned about is that we're having a conversation when people are grieving, there used to be a common decency in this country where people pause from talking about policy.Unfortunately, with Dianne Feinstein and Michael Bloomberg, they want to exploit a tragedy from day. It's shameful. But apparently, that's the new normal and that's why we're talking to you today.WALLACE: Well, I want to pick up on that, because while the NRA is talking about bump stocks, there are number of gun control advocates, a number of them Democrats who are calling for more sweeping measures. Here's a few.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I can't believe one whole political party in the greatest country on earth is totally sold to the gun lobby.REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALI., HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: They're going to say, if you give them a bump stock, it's going to be a slippery slope -- I certainly hope so.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Now, I know that sets your teeth on edge.You say common decency, let's wait. What's enough time? I mean, here where 58 people killed, almost 500 injured, is it common decency to wait a day, two days, a week, a month?I mean, it is understandable. You can -- I know you don't agree with their solution, but what's wrong with saying we need to address this issue?COX: Well, let me talk about Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi both and get back to that point. You can see Pelosi has said, and I take her at her word, I take Dianne Feinstein at her word when she says that she had 51 votes in the Senate for Mr. and Ms. America to turn in all of your guns, they would do it.Look, the talking points might change for Dianne Feinstein, but the underlying agenda never does.And the truth is, Hillary Clinton ran as a most pro-gun control candidate in America and she lost. And -- but she gets an award, she gets an award for hypocrisy, because she will never spend a moment, a breath, without armed security surrounding her for the rest of her life, she will never dial 911, she'll never lived in a high crime area, but her life is no more valuable than a single mom living in Chicago, working the late shift, who wants to own a gun and carry it to defend herself.That's why we're calling on Congress to yes, look at firearms, but also --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: I want to pick up on that and I'm going to throw a little monkey wrench at the control room because we're going to play an earlier bite, because you and I talked earlier this weekend and you said that you want to have a sensible conversation about gun control.Wayne LaPierre, the head of NRA, talked this week and I want to play a clip from what he said. Here he is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WAYNE LAPIERRE, CEO, NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION: One thing the American public always knows, that the elites always protect themselves and they always protect themselves with guns, and they lecture the American public how you shouldn't do that.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: The reason I pick up on that is because you are in effect with saying the same thing about every Clinton. Is that a sensible way to have this conversation, to try to turn it into class warfare where you're for gun control, somehow you're part of an elite?COX: It's not class warfare. Chris, it's what the American people want. The American people want to protect themselves. They want to be able to defend themselves. Yes, we're willing to have a conversation --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: But, wait, no -- that's actually -- that's not actually true. I mean, yes, Second Amendment, but if you talk about background checks, if you talk about automatic weapon -- well, let me just say that. There are a lot of people, in fact a majority of people, according to the polls, would like to see those gun controls.I'm just -- I have to say I'm put off at the argument that if you believe in gun control, you're an elite. I have to tell you, Mr. Cox, I know very few people outside of public officials -- she was a former first lady, she was former secretary of state -- who have armed bodyguards. One of the few people I know, private people, who has armed bodyguards is Wayne LaPierre.COX: Chris, as a law-abiding gun owner, I am armed security. But I couldn't bring a gun into Washington, D.C., because my license gun, because they won't allow me to protect myself.(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: That's not my point, sir.(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: My point is -- no, my point is you cannot have a gun and you can believe in gun control because you think it's dangerous. Now, we can argue about the merits of it, but I think to dismiss people and say, well, that's just the elite and they have armed guards is, it seems to me, does a disservice to your argument.COX: It's the hypocrisy that bothers the American people, Chris. It's the hypocrisy coming out of Hollywood. It's the hypocrisy coming out of politicians, and it's the hypocrisy coming out of a lot of people in the media who refused to accept that law-abiding people in between New York and Los Angeles, and in between Washington, D.C., and Miami deserve the right to defend themselves. That's what the National Rifle Association exists for.And, look, we can talk about background checks. This murderer in Las Vegas passed them. So did the gentleman or the murderer in Orlando, Tucson, Aurora, Fort Hood --WALLACE: Let's talk about background checks and let's talk about specific issues, because you're certainly right, he did pass them and he brought all these guns legally. There is a 72-hour limit on background checks, and as a result, some people call that the Charleston loophole because Dylann Roof, the man who bought a gun through a background check and then killed nine people in a church, you can see his picture there, he got the gun because the background check wasn't complete in 72 hours even though he would have failed that background check.Question for you, Mr. Cox, when it's a matter of life and death, and I understand, you don't want background checks to go on forever, that's not appropriate. But when it's a matter of life and death, couldn't it be four days or five days and not three days and he gets his gun?COX: Sure, the National Rifle Association has worked to include every mental health record, every court adjudication, every criminal record to make sure that people don't fall through the cracks. The National Rifle Association --WALLACE: That's not -- that's not true, sir.COX: That's absolutely true, Chris.WALLACE: No, it isn't. Forgive me -- in February, President Trump signed a measure that said that the Social Security Administration no longer has to provide information on mental disorders to the national background criminal check and the NRA supported that.COX: That is a complete misrepresentation of our position, a complete misrepresentation of what President Trump did. What he said is you can't arbitrarily deny a senior citizen their Second Amendment rights based on no finding of dangerousness. The only finding was that they asked somebody to help them manage their financial affairs.If you think that somebody needing help with a checkbook should eliminate them from exercising their Second Amendment, then you under --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Mental disorders -- now, I agree, it wasn't everybody. It was some people with mental disorders and you backed that.COX: Their definition of a mental disorder was someone who asked for help handling their finances. That is not a prohibitive category, Chris, and it shouldn't be a prohibitive category.WALLACE: Let me ask you about another measure that has been talked about, and before I do, I want you to just watch this video. Here it is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Stay down.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: You hear that gunfire. One reason that Stephen Paddock was able to fire so quickly, so many shots so quickly was because he had a high-capacity magazine, he had a bunch of them that held between 60 and 100 rounds.Now, I understand Second Amendment, Supreme Court has ruled on it. Why do you need a magazine that holds 100 rounds?COX: There's no one in America who watches that video that's not horrified. And NRA members that were at that concert I'm sure were more horrified than you and I were.And so, the question, and it's a fair question and it's to ask, if banning me from owning these sorts of things would prevent a criminal for going out and misusing them, that is a fair question. And what you have to do is look at, what has Congress done? Congress banned semiautomatics and high-capacity magazines for 10 years, 10 years. And Bill Clinton's own Justice Department said it had no impact on crime.California still bans those magazines, but it didn't prevent San Bernardino or Santa Barbara. In Europe, there's virtually entire bans on everything, but it didn't stop murderers using machine guns -(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: We're running out of time, sir. But even when you see that horrific video and he is firing this (ph) because of the bump stocks and it's because of the magazines that he is able to fire 100 rounds in a few seconds, less than a minute. No qualms about allowing people? Let me flip it around, why should, in 30 seconds if you will, why do shooters need people to hunt, to protect themselves, why do they need magazines with 100 rounds in them?COX: People need -- first of all, it's intentionally designed to scare people. People own magazines of different capacities for different reasons.WALLACE: You know, 10 rounds would be enough?COX: It depends on what you have it for. It depends on what you have it for. People can own things safely and responsibly and be a danger to no one. And that's the part of this conversation. It can't be a fair and balance conversation if you're not willing to discuss the broader problems that we have with the violent culture coming out of Hollywood, with video games that fundamentally change how military simulators work.WALLACE: Mr. Cox, it's obviously -- we didn't agree. We're going to settle this in this short period of time. Thank you so much for coming in today. Please come back and we'll continue the conversation.COX: I'll look forward to it. Thanks, Chris.WALLACE: Hopefully not as another one of these terrible tragedies.Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss where things stand in the debate over gun control.Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about chances for new gun laws in the wake of the Las Vegas massacre. Just go to Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday and we may use your question on the air.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: Coming up, Secretary of State Tillerson knocks down reports he considered quitting.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REX TILLERSON, SECRETARY OF STATE: I serve at the appointment of thee president and I am here for as long as the president feels I can be useful to achieving his objectives.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday panel about the relationship between President Trump and Rex Tillerson, coming up.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PAUL RYAN, R-WIS., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Apparently this allows you to take a semiautomatic, turn it into a fully automatic. So clearly that's something that we need to look into.SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, D-CALIFORNIA: I hope senators will finally summon the political courage to stand up and say, enough is enough.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Some rare bipartisan agreement this week from Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein and House Speaker Paul Ryan, at least on the issue of bump stocks.And it's time now for our Sunday group.Former National Security Council staffer Gillian Turner, columnist for The Hill, Juan Williams, Julie Pace, Washington bureau chief for The Associated Press, and Tom Rogan of The Washington Examiner.Julie, what do you make of Republicans like Paul Ryan saying that they want to take a look at bump stocks? Is this the beginning of a conversation, a broader conversation, of gun controls, or are they trying to limit it to this one device, which is so hard to defend?JULIE PACE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS: I'm not sure we're going to see any broader conversation on gun control. I think the fact that Republicans and the NRA came out -- the White House as well -- came out and expressed an openness on bump stocks is certainly an interesting development because we rarely even see Republicans go after some of the low-hanging fruit on this gun control debate here.I think that there's going to be a reluctance on the part of GOP lawmakers to go any further on that. Certainly the NRA would push back pretty aggressively if they started to do that. But I think on this issue, look, there's not a huge constituency for bump stocks. I think most people can agree that if you're going to take a device, put it on a semi -- a legal semiautomatic weapon and turn it into a fully automatic weapon, that that's something that needs to be addressed. You have unanimity on that across the political spectrum.WALLACE: We asked you for question for the panel, and on this issue of gun control in the wake of the Las Vegas massacre, Rick Reuss tweeted this, what conceivable gun legislation could have prevented the evil that occurred in Las Vegas?Tom as Chris Cox of the NRA pointed out, Stephen Paddock bought all these guns legally, he passed all the background checks. So how do you answer Rick.TOM ROGAN, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Well, I think the broader point here is that whether we're talking about this particular incident of gun violence or the broader issue of terrorism in the age of ISIS, and I'm not drawing connection between the two points, but the relevance of potential mass casualty events makes them similar in terms of issue. You could, for example, put in checkpoint at every major public event, at every major hotel. You could have personal inspections. But the ultimate problem comes down to what measure of freedom of movement, ease of movement, are you willing to give up in return for a greater measure of security? And, ultimately, that fixes right back to the Second Amendment debate.I suspect what we will see here, if you look at the two most recent Supreme Court cases on the Second Amendment, Heller and McDonnell, there's actually quite a lot of wiggle room there for local governments, especially when it comes to the public carrying element to do things. So I think it's going to down (ph) fast.WALLACE: Yes, we should point that out. I did an interview some years ago with Antonin Scalia, who wrote the Heller decision, and he specifically said there is an unfettered right to the Second Amendment, but that doesn't mean there can't be gun controls, reasonable, sensible ones that don't infringe.All right, let's turn to another hot topic. The Trump administration, on Friday, announced broad, new exceptions to the Obamacare mandates on birth control. The insurance plans have to provide contraception coverage to their employees. Here was President Trump earlier talking about religious freedom.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: WE are ending the attack son your religious liberty and we are proudly reaffirming America's leadership role as a nation that protects religious freedom for everyone.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Gillian, the religious right is delighted with this, the president's decision, and he's made several in this regard to say that employers, for reasons either of religion or moral beliefs are not to be forced to provide birth control, contraception, to their employees. On the other hand, women's groups are incensed by this decision.GILLIAN TURNER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: And groups on the right look at this as a victory, but I would caution the president and all Republicans that chipping away at the Affordable Care Act, executive order -- one executive order at a time is going to be an awfully painful exercise over the next few years.If we look at what Chuck Schumer said to the president last week over the phone, which was allegedly repeal and replace is now dead for the final time --WALLACE: Well, let me back up -- and just for folks who don't follow it like we do. the president and Schumer talked and the president talked about maybe we can do a deal with the Democrats and then Schumer said --TURNER: And then Schumer said, Mr. President, repeal and replacing Obamacare is officially dead. It died its last death a couple of weeks ago. If we take him at his word, the president really has two paths forward. One is, reforming Obamacare through executive action, which is the option I refer to is going to be incredibly painful for everybody involved. You can also try and cut a deal with Dems.I think the president is showing this week, this past week, that he's trying to pursue both those options at once. I mean maybe he'll forge a certain degree of success with congressional Democrats on this, but he's not going to get a deal that's going to replace -- repeal and replace Obamacare. Whatever way we look at this going forward, because of the Republicans failure to get this done for the president, it's going to be painful for him.WALLACE: Juan, I want to pick up on this because I'm curious about the politics of it. On the one hand, look, the president promised this on the campaign trail. He's keeping a promise that helped get him elected. On the other hand, if you look at the polls, most people support the idea of the provision of contraception. So, you know, he's pleasing his base but he's turning off a majority of voters.JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes, but he's pleasing his base. And it's an interesting political dynamic here, Chris, because he's not only pulling the contraception mandate, but he's also pulling money for the promotion of Obamacare and to enroll people at this point. So he's actively trying to undermine Obamacare, I think, to make the case to Schumer and the Democrats, this is imploding and you're going to come to me to want to make a deal to try to rescue it. I think that is his bargaining position is, with regard to the politics with the base, the base has no wall, they have no Obamacare repeal, they have a debt deal with Chuck and Nancy, if you'll recall. I think there's a little bit of anxiety inside that White House with Steve Bannon gone about making sure that you are always playing to the base.But I worry that it's less catering at this point than pandering to people who are, I think, misinformed about the consequences. It's almost like Trump is now saying, you know what, yes, we didn't get done what we promised you, conservative base, but we are still actively here trying to drain the swamp or disrupt things. Well, has your life improved? That's what Ronald Reagan asked. Is your life better off today than it was when I -- when --WALLACE: Well, that's not a rhetorical question.WILLIAMS: No.WALLACE: Some people would say the economy's doing pretty well.WILLIAMS: Oh, yes. And we lost jobs for the first time because of a hurricane --WALLACE: Yes, have you -- have you heard of Harvey and Irma?WILLIAMS: Yes, but have you heard, first time in seven years? Have you heard about a tax cut deal that benefits the rich disproportionately, not the blue collar worker? I think people will have to get that information at some point.WALLACE: Tom.ROGAN: I think corporate tax reform. This is one of the things that I think the president deserves courage on and House Republican leaders. It is not fashionable in the age of Bernie Sanders to say, corporate tax reform. But if you speak to economists, investment productivity, that is the key.WALLACE: I have to say, only on our panel do we go from birth control to corporate tax reform without missing a beat.We have to take a break here.Up next, will President Trump decertify the Iran nuclear deal this week? And what about his relationship with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You guys know what this represents?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE).TRUMP: I don't know, maybe it's the calm before the storm.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What storm, Mr. President?TRUMP: You'll find out.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: President Trump raising a lot of questions during a photo-op with his top military brass, and we're back now with the panel.Well, one thought about a possible storm is that the president may, and in fact is expected, to announce this week that he will decertify the Iran deal, say that it's no longer in the national interest. But that doesn't end the deal. It then goes to Congress and the Congress has 60 days to decide whether or not they are going to re-impose the sanctions that were lifted as part of the deal. And if they don't do that, then, guess what, we're still in the deal, which raises the question, Gillian, what would that have (ph) step (ph)? He decertifies but the sanctions stay lifted. What would that accomplish?TURNER: Well, it's a sort of middle ground for the president, which is why maybe he's going to go in this direction. It's a middle ground in that it doesn't kill the deal, but it passes the buck to Congress. So the first reason I think the president is not going to recertify is that he enjoys nothing more than passing the buck to Congress, making them make these hard decisions, like we saw with DACA. What will happen if he does not recertify Iran's compliance with the JCPOA on October 15th --WALLACE: Which is the Iran deal.TURNER: The Iran deal. It hands it to Congress and they have 60 days to debate and then make their own decision via a vote.The second reason I don't think he's going to recertify is that the albatross around his neck at this moment is every 90 days he's got to very publicly sign an agreement that shows Iran has been complying with this deal. It is something that is a thorn in his side on the foreign policy spectrum like nothing else. It is an Obama -- from President Trump's perspective, this is an Obama-era legacy he --WALLACE: So once he decertifies, he's off that hook?TURNER: He's just itching, itching to free himself from that.PACE: This is exactly what we've heard, that it's the act of having to certify every 90 days, that Trump actually has to sign a certification that is driving him crazy. That that is one of the driving factors in this debate, which is pretty amazing, actually.WALLACE: Defense Secretary Mattis testified before Congress this week and he was asked the key question on this matter.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. ANGUS KING, I-MAINE: Do you believe it's in our national security interest at the present time to remain in the JCPOA? That's a ""yes"" or ""no"" question.JAMES MATTIS, DEFENSE SECRETARY: Yes, senator, I do.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: You can tell how excited Secretary Mattis was to have to answer that question.Juan, the president is apparently going against almost his entire senior national security team in making this decision to decertify. Why do you think that is?WILLIAMS: Well, I think he's playing to the base. We were talking about this a moment ago. But I think that this is a very aggressive step to say, listen to the base. I promised you during the campaign that I would get rid of this Iran deal. I said it was the worst deal ever for the United States, it was a rip-off, and I am going to act on my campaign promise because it's not only his inner circle -- and there's lots of reports this week that, you know, Tillerson called him a moron and all that, but also that Tillerson, Kelly, Mattis have some kind of suicide pact where they said, you know, if he fires any one of us, we're all going. But that they are there because, in the word of Bob Corker, the head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a Republican, they act as a buffer. They are stopping chaos in terms of our foreign policy from becoming imposed by the president. It's a very intriguing situation. But the president, I think in this instance, is playing to the base one more.WALLACE: Yes, we should point out, those were the views of senator -- or the statement of Senator Corker, not of the --WILLIAMS: Yes.WALLACE: OK.Speaking of splits between the president and top advisers, let's talk about this split with Rex Tillerson. There was a report this week that Tillerson had seriously considered quitting over the summer and that at one point, not to be president, but to some other people he called the president a moron. That led to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REX TILLERSON, SECRETARY OF STATE: It continues to be misreported. There has never been a consideration in my mind to leave.DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have a very good relationship. We disagree on a couple of things. Sometimes I'd like him to be a little bit tougher. But other than that, we have a very good relationship.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Other than that, I think, my (INAUDIBLE) --PACE: I mean that point nearly is the kiss of death from (INAUDIBLE).WALLACE: What's really going on here, and is Tillerson out or not?PACE: So this has been a complicated relationship for a long time. Months ago I had a senior administration official tell me that Trump likes the idea of Tillerson, the businessman, the Texas swagger, more than he actually liked Tillerson himself. He really gets annoyed at the way Tillerson handles himself in meetings. He doesn't like the idea that Tillerson, especially on this North Korea issue, has been pushing this idea of diplomacy, which he is the nation's top diplomat. That is, in general, what he is supposed to do.So this is highly complicated. Tillerson has been frustrated by being undermined by presidential tweets. He's been frustrated that Jared Kushner has picked up a large part of the foreign policy portfolio. And the big challenge for Tillerson right now -- and I think the thing that I've heard that he is going to have to decide about in terms of his future here is, what kind of juice does he have left with foreign government? When he is traveling around the world, when he is meeting with foreign leaders and he says this is a position of the United States government, do they believe him anymore? And, frankly, talking to diplomats around town, they don't always believe him.WALLACE: I want to pick up on exactly that point with you, Tom, because whether Tillerson stays or not, you would think that his effectiveness as secretary of state has been dramatically diminished. Leaders around the world are watching all this play out. And we've seen the president, in the case of North Korea, as soon as Tillerson said in China last week that we have avenues to talk to North Korea, the president tweeted, don't waste your time, Rex. I mean --ROGAN: It's unity of message, stupid, would be the foreign policy equivalent of the famous line. And that is so critical here because, you know, as Julie suggests, when foreign diplomats hear from American diplomats -- not just about Tillerson, right, it's about all the Foreign Service officers in every embassy around the world. If they are having those lunch meetings with foreign officials and journalists and they are not seen as credible, in line with the president, it's a huge problem. But it's also a huge problem for President Trump in the sense that if you talk about the Iran deal now, with that short window if he decertifies effectively to get the French crucially on board, who may come on board with him about reforming the deal, if they don't trust the only guy who's in the room in Paris with them, Secretary of State Tillerson, their willingness to say to all their domestic manufacturers who have those nice deals in Iran, hey, by the way, we're going to push on this, but those manufacturers say then, well, you're talking to Tillerson. Trump is tweeting, Tillerson's an idiot. That -- that -- that -- that -- that is very hard diplomacy.WALLACE: You've got about 30 seconds.TURNER: If I -- if I may. I believe Secretary Tillerson's future hinges on whether or not he did call President Trump a moron. And I mean this in a very specific sense. If he did, it will ultimately be made known to the president. It is a fireball offense for any secretary of state throughout the course of U.S. history. I'm including people like Henry Kissinger here.It is not something a secretary of state can survive. And so all of the policy issues, all of the disagreement will fall by the wayside and it will come down to whether or not there is proof that he spoke about the president (INAUDIBLE).WALLACE: All right, I've got -- I've got 10 seconds. Did he call him a moron or not?PACE: I personally have not confirmed it, but I will say, I had someone point out, that he's an Eagle Scout and he did not specifically deny it in his press conference.WALLACE: Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday. That's -- Boy Scouts.Up next, our ""Power Player of the Week."" From the football field to outer space, how a former astronaut is using his story to inspire others.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: Only 362 Americans have had the chance to fly into space. But one astronaut is using his unique path there to inspire young people on their own journeys. Here's our ""Power Player of the Week.""(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)LELAND MELVIN, AUTHOR, ""CHASING SPACE"": No matter where you come from, no matter what zip code you're in, you know, with grit, with grace and perseverance and a lot of second chances, you can do anything you put your mind to.WALLACE: Leland Melvin has gone to remarkable places, including 374 orbits of our planet. But it's his journey to get there that's the real story.MELVIN: My mother gave me a chemistry set when I was probably seven or eight years old. It was a non-OSHA certified, age inappropriate chemistry set where I created the most incredible explosion in her living room.WALLACE: Melvin was hooked. He played football and won at scholarship to the University of Richmond as a wide receiver. But that was never his passion.MELVIN: I didn't watch, you know, Monday night football on the NFL. I was doing chemistry labs. So it wasn't something that was my favorite thing. But it was -- it was something that got me to college.WALLACE: Football did more than that. He was drafted to play in the NFL, but even trying out for the Dallas Cowboys was a balancing act.MELVIN: By day I'm catching footballs for America's team with Danny White and all these people, Hershel Walker. And at night I'm watching material science engineering videotapes. And that was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life.WALLACE: A hamstring injury ended his football career. Melvin went back to school, got his masters and became a research scientist at NASA. Then, in 1998, he applied to be an astronaut.MELVIN: Only a few of us have been in the NFL and been engineers at NASA and scientists at NASA. And so I think that kind of differentiated me from some of the other candidates.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, and liftoff of Space Shuttle Atlantis.WALLACE: In 2008, Melvin went on the first of two shuttle missions. His role, operating the robotic arm to install a lab on the International Space Station. But he says orbiting the earth every 90 minutes made a more profound impression.MELVIN: You're connected to everyone as you go around the planet. And so it's one of these things where my perspective shifted. I wanted to come home and really help inspire that next generation.WALLACE: At a book fair in Washington this summer, Melvin shared his life lesson.MELVIN: Opportunities come to you, but you have to be prepared for that opportunity. And having that one person in your life, all you need is one, that has your back and believes in you.WALLACE: There's a big push these days for kids to study STEM, science, technology, engineering, and math. But Melvin talks about STEAM, adding thee Arts.MELVIN: If you say that STEM is the most important thing, then you're leaving out the artists and the musicians and the creators that are -- that are truly part of anything that you're designing or building.WALLACE: Melvin's book is called ""Chasing Space,"" featuring a photo that's gone viral at him and his two dogs. What he wants is for young people to chase blank, whatever their passion is.MELVIN: When I share the story, I share the experiences, and a kid who was on a path of going maybe nowhere sees a spark and looks up in the night sky and one day I may watch them in my rocking chair heading off to Mars, that's what gets me so stoked.(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: Melvin made headlines recently writing an open letter to President Trump, calling his criticism of NFL players kneeling during the national anthem divisive.Well, that's almost it for a packed program.As you may know, we're the official Sunday show of the Washington Nationals. Last night the Nationals beat the Chicago Cubs 6-3 to even the National League Division series at one game apiece. And someone was so excited, he showed up this morning.

I'm Christiane Amanpour, and at the top of the news this week, the president and the new Congress. OBAMA: We can't afford two years of just squabbling. AMANPOUR: Is it time for compromise? BOEHNER: The American people will want us to focus on their message during the election. AMANPOUR: Or is it time for gridlock? MCCONNELL: If the administration wants cooperation, it will have to begin to move in our direction. AMANPOUR: This morning... (UNKNOWN): We've come to take our government back! AMANPOUR: ... Mr. Smith goes to Washington, an exclusive interview with Rand Paul, Tea Party senator-elect. Then, wedded to tax cuts. (UNKNOWN): Cut taxes. (UNKNOWN): Cut taxes. (UNKNOWN): Cut taxes. (UNKNOWN): Cut taxes. (UNKNOWN): Cut taxes. AMANPOUR: Their hero may be Ronald Reagan, but his tax man says that'll finish the economy off, while this Republican says tax cuts will revive it. David Stockman versus Michael Pence, an exclusive ""This Week"" debate. Plus, our roundtable, Democratic Senator Evan Bayh and former Obama adviser John Podesta join ABC's George Will, political director Amy Walter, and former Bush strategist Matthew Dowd. And remembering another historic election 50 (ph) years ago this week. Plus, the Sunday funnies. LETTERMAN: That's where our kids will live, the future, Republicans and Democrats working together. We're screwed. ANNOUNCER: From all across our world to the heart of our nation's capital, ABC's ""This Week"" with Christiane Amanpour starts now. AMANPOUR: Hello again, everyone. After Tuesday's election, Republicans have the largest House majority since the late 1940s during the Truman administration. What they do with that majority and whether Democrats and Republicans will work together is our focus this morning. ABC's John Donvan starts us off. DONVAN (voice-over): Listen and see if you can pick out -- and it's going to be easy, actually -- the hottest, hippest word of the week. (UNKNOWN): Well, it was a historic election. (UNKNOWN): A historic... (UNKNOWN): ... historic... (UNKNOWN): ... historic... (UNKNOWN): ... historic night. (UNKNOWN): ... historic... (UNKNOWN): ... historic election. DONVAN: You got it. What we saw in this election, a president who took a shellacking... OBAMA: I'm sure there are easier ways to learn these lessons. DONVAN: ... a GOP that gets to gloat again, just careful not too much... BOEHNER: This is not a time for celebration. It's a time to roll up our sleeves and go to work. DONVAN: That outcome made this election -- oh, here we go again... (UNKNOWN): ... historic opportunity here... DONVAN: Yes, historic. DONVAN: Or maybe not. Simply put, history is the writing down of what happens, and a lot of things happened, happened even last week. Giants over Rangers to take the Series in five, it happened, but was it historic? Maybe if you live in the Bay Area. For the rest of us, though, historic is defined by what gets remembered long afterward, for changing what followed, like Susana Martinez, the Republican who won the governor's race in New Mexico Tuesday. BLITZER: She's a Latina, and so this is historic in New Mexico. DONVAN: Yes, Wolf, that was arguably historic. No one could achieve that first ever again. But the mere fact of the GOP capture of the House -- here is the chart, the 60-plus seats they took from the Democrats -- it's a lot, but it's not a record-breaker. The thing is, we really need to know what the Republicans ultimately do with their win to see what will really change. 1994, when they swept both houses, then something changed. They came in with clear ideas. They were listed in their Contract with America. They said they were going to work with the Democratic president. (UNKNOWN): We can only have president at a time. It's President Clinton. And we know that we need to work with him where we can. DONVAN: And what they got was, after a fair amount of struggle, a Democratic president to declare... CLINTON: The era of big government is over. DONVAN: ... welfare reform. We have never been the same, and both sides had a hand in it. This time, the main GOP idea is not Obama, not his policies... MCCONNELL: Our primary legislative goals are to repeal and replace and health spending bill. DONVAN: ... and not really much pretense at a governing partnership. MCCONNELL: The only way to do all of those things is to put someone in the White House who won't veto any of these things. DONVAN: So is that the mindset that is going to make things happen in Washington that will prove that this election in the end was as historic as everyone said it was on night one? For ""This Week,"" John Donvan, ABC News. AMANPOUR: One of those aiming to make history is Rand Paul, senator-elect from Kentucky, and he joins me this morning. Welcome. Thank you for being here. AMANPOUR: In a way, it is, to coin a phrase, historic. There's never been a Tea Party in modern American history, and you are one of the prominent Tea Partiers. What is your first aim once you get to -- to the Senate? PAUL: I think the debt. We have to do something about the debt. I think we've been fiscally irresponsible for a generation or more here. And the one thing about the Tea Party that's interesting is, it really is equal parts chastisement to both parties. You know, Republicans doubled the debt when we were in charge, and then Democrats are tripling the debt. And I've said this over and over again. It's not about political party, but it is about fiscally trying to do something to balance our budget. AMANPOUR: Well, we've all seen and we followed the campaign, and there was a lot of talk, a lot of slogans and platitudes about cutting the debt, balancing the budget, cutting the deficit. But there has not been any direct information on how you're going to do that, no specifics. It was fairly content-free, the platform. So where are you going to cut in order to make a meaningful change? PAUL: Well, some of it has to be procedural, in the sense that we need to balance our budget by law. If you force legislators to balance, at the end of the day, if it has to be balanced, then they step up and they become legislators and can find out where to cut. AMANPOUR: So you're going to move for a balanced budget amendment? PAUL: Absolutely. Absolutely. And short of that, we need a rule -- it takes a while to get an amendment to the Constitution -- let's have a rule that -- let's obey our rule. They passed pay-as-you-go, and they break it in the first three weeks they have it. So we need rules. PAUL: And we need to obey the rules. The second thing you need is -- and I don't see things in terms of political party, so I think this can be something where I can work across the aisle -- but the second thing you need is a compromise on where the spending cuts come from. Republicans traditionally say, oh, we'll cut domestic spending, but we won't touch the military. The liberals -- the ones who are good -- will say, oh, we'll cut the military, but we won't cut domestic spending. AMANPOUR: All right. Well, let's ask you. PAUL: Bottom line is, you have to look at everything across the board. AMANPOUR: All right. Where, then? Military? Would you cut the military? AMANPOUR: By how much? Obviously, Robert Gates has made some suggestions. PAUL: Well, I think it's hard -- it's hard to give exact numbers, but I think one thing that's concerning -- you know, recently, Admiral Milliken (ph) said that the interest on the debt now is going to approach in the next couple of years -- just the interest on the debt -- will approach what we spend in the national defense budget. So, I mean, that should alarm us all. Bernanke says the debt is unsustainable. We need to do something about it. AMANPOUR: The question, again, is, exactly what? Because, again, the Republicans in the campaign have come up with $50 billion here, $100 billion there, a lot to you and me, but in terms of reducing a $1.3 trillion deficit, how does the math add up? PAUL: It has to be... AMANPOUR: Are you going to cut entitlements? PAUL: It has to be everything across the board. AMANPOUR: Entitlements? PAUL: And you -- you have to look at entitlements. AMANPOUR: Social Security? PAUL: What I would say is not the people who are currently on it and not those approaching retirement, but the sooner we fix it, the better. So it may be 55 and under, but that should be this year. We should look at 55 and under, what do we do to change the system to make it more sustainable? AMANPOUR: Raise the retirement age? PAUL: You may have to. You may have to. They're already talking about it. I mean, there's a bipartisan commission up here talking about raising age, graduating the benefits, maybe having means testing. You have to look at all of these things. They need to be on the table. But what you have to get to get there is you have to take it out of campaign mode. PAUL: You know, everybody in the campaign mode, how long have we been running Mediscare ads? Democrats have run against Republicans for years saying we're going to take away your grandmother's Social Security. We're not going to do that. PAUL: But we need to fix it, because we have too many people retiring. AMANPOUR: What about health care? All candidates were saying we had to repeal health care, yet the American people did not say that in this election: 47 percent said repeal; 48 percent said no. PAUL: Well, it depends on -- depends on where you look. You look in Missouri, 70 percent voted to get rid of Obamacare. AMANPOUR: But just across -- across the board, is that what you're going to do? PAUL: In Kentucky, 70 percent of the people would like to repeal it or have our attorney general challenge the constitutionality of it. I think there are some real constitutional questions. It's going forward. A federal judge in both Florida and Virginia have said, yes, we're going to go forward with this. So I think you will see that go forward and we will challenge it in the courts. And also we should try to repeal it. AMANPOUR: Let me ask you this in terms, again, of balancing the budget. There are many economists who simply say the math does not add up if you're not going to agree to raising taxes. Do you agree that taxes will have to be raised, as well? PAUL: Well, I think it's not a revenue problem; it's a spending problem. AMANPOUR: But it is a revenue problem, according to so many economists. PAUL: Well, yes and no. I mean, we bring in -- the thing is, is that a lot of times people would come to me and say, well, you don't believe in any government. And I would tell them, you know what? I believe in $2.4 trillion worth; I just don't think you can have $4 trillion worth if you only bring in $2.4 trillion. 2.4's a lot. That's a huge government. We've doubled the size of government in 10 years. PAUL: We don't need bigger government. We need to shrink the size of government. AMANPOUR: Right, but without making strong entitlement and other cuts -- and even if one does, most of the economists say the math simply doesn't add up to keep -- to keep tax cuts on and on and on. Will you agree to some? PAUL: My -- my hope now -- my hope is to be on the Budget Committee and to go through all of these numbers and, by January, to have a balanced budget that I will introduce. I want there to be a Republican alternative -- whether it wins or not, I want the Republican message to be one of balanced budgets. If they won't do it in a year, we'll say, how about two years? If they won't do it in two years, how about three years? But someone has to believe it. AMANPOUR: Give me one specific cut, Senator-elect. PAUL: All across the board. AMANPOUR: One significant one. No, but you can't just keep saying all across the board. PAUL: Well, no, I can, because I'm going to look at every program, every program. But I would freeze federal hiring. I would maybe reduce federal employees by 10 percent. I'd probably reduce their wages by 10 percent. The average federal employee makes $120,000 a year. The average private employee makes $60,000 a year. Let's get them more in line, and let's find savings. Let's hire no new federal workers. AMANPOUR: Pay for soldiers? Would you cut that? PAUL: I think that's something that you can't do. I don't think... AMANPOUR: You cannot do? PAUL: Right. I think that soldiers have to be paid. Now, can we say that gradually we don't need as large of an Army if we're not in two wars? Yes, I think you can say that. You can save money there. You can bring some troops home or have Europe pay more for their defense and Japan pay more and Korea pay more for their defense or bring those troops home and have savings there. AMANPOUR: Have you thought much about foreign policy? Does the Tea Party have a foreign policy? PAUL: I think the Tea Party believes in a strong national defense, that it's a priority for our country, that the Constitution exemplifies and says that national defense is one of our priorities. But, no, primarily the Tea Party is about the debt. It's concerned and worried that we're inheriting or passing along this debt to our kids and our grandkids, is the number one thing of the Tea Party. AMANPOUR: So, again, to talk about the debt and to talk about taxes, there seems to be, again, just so much sort of generalities, for want of a better word. AMANPOUR: And, for instance, there are many people... PAUL: Well, the thing is that you can call it a generality, but what if -- what if I were president and I said to you, ""Tomorrow, we're going to have a 5 percent cut across the board in everything""? That's not a generality, but there are thousands of programs. If you say, ""Well, what are all the specifics?"" There are books written on all the specifics. There's a book by Christopher Edwards, downsizing government, goes through every program. That's what it will take. It's a very detailed analysis. But you need to ask of every program, when we take no program off the table, can it be downsized? Can it be privatized? Can it be made smaller? AMANPOUR: And what about earmarks? Would you say no to earmarks? PAUL: No -- no more earmarks. AMANPOUR: No more? Not even in your state? PAUL: No. No. But I do tell people within Kentucky is I say, look, I will argue within the committee process for things that are good for Kentucky that they want and also within the context of a balanced budget. Here's what happens. You go to the Transportation Committee and they say, ""What do you want?"" But it should be, ""How much do we have?"" No one asks, ""How much do we have?"" So we just spend it. And then, at the end of the day, if we don't have it, we either print it or borrow it. Those are bad things. There is no restraint, but that's why you need rules. In Kentucky, we have a balanced budget amendment. We have to balance our budget. So they have to be better legislators. AMANPOUR: One of the emergencies is going to be voting to lift the debt ceiling. AMANPOUR: Would you do that? PAUL: I don't believe I will vote to raise the debt ceiling. PAUL: No. I think that we need to send a message -- we need to send a strong message that... AMANPOUR: The government would default, then. PAUL: Well, only if we won the vote, would they default. AMANPOUR: So you think it won't pass? PAUL: You know, I think it's unlikely. There are people who vote against the debt ceiling every time to send a message that adding more debt is wrong. I think we shouldn't add more debt. I think we should immediately start cutting spending. We should have a freezing hire. We should not spend any more of the stimulus money that's unspent, the TARP money that's unspent. You know, we need to get our fiscal house in order. But bigger than the specifics is a rule. Congress does not obey their own rules. This is what -- you want to know where the Tea Party is, why we're unhappy? We're unhappy because they pass pay-as-you-go and, in the first three weeks, they say everything's an emergency and they evade their own rules. That's a problem. AMANPOUR: Right. Well, let me -- let me ask you about some of the challenges you might face from within your own party. Do you expect to be welcomed with open arms by the establishment Republicans? Trent Lott, former senior leader of the Republican Party, said when you get to Congress, they've got to co-opt you. PAUL: Well, I think the interesting thing is... AMANPOUR: Are you co-optable? PAUL: No, but I think the Tea Party actually is co-opting Washington. You look around you... AMANPOUR: So vice versa? PAUL: Absolutely. We're coming. We're -- we're proud. We're strong. We're loud. And we're going to co-opt. And, in fact, I think we're already shaping the debate. You hear a lot of talk about the debt now. Where do you think that's coming from? AMANPOUR: Can you compromise with the Democrats? PAUL: That's coming from our movement. Absolutely. And I told you where the compromise is. The compromise is, Republicans never say they'll cut anything out of military. What I say is, national defense is the most important thing we do in Washington, but there's still waste in the military budget. You have to make it smaller, but you also then need to address, how many wars are we going to be involved in? Are we going to be involved in every war all the time? AMANPOUR: Afghanistan? Are you going to call for early withdrawal there? PAUL: We have to -- we need to have a debate over it. PAUL: We need to have a debate over it. AMANPOUR: But the president has a timetable. Do you disagree with that? PAUL: Right. What I think is that ultimately troop deployments are decided by the president, not by Congress. I don't think really Congress can decide troop levels. In fact, I think if Congress told him to bring all of them home on a certain time, I think he can do what he wants constitutionally. But what I would say is, we need to have a debate in our country, in our Congress over, is our national security still threatened by Afghanistan? Do we need to be there? Do we need to be there in a large... AMANPOUR: Do you think so? PAUL: Well, do we need to be there? I want to ask these questions. Some of them I don't know all the information yet. But what I would say is, do we need to be there in a large ground -- ground war? Or could we be there on a smaller base and have the Afghans -- after 10 years... AMANPOUR: Well, that's the debate that's going on right now, in any event. PAUL: Well, after 10 years, I think the Afghans need to have stepped up more to do more. And if you ask our G.I.s, when I asked them from Kentucky leaving the base, I say, ""Are the Afghans stepping up enough? Would you rather the Afghans do more of the patrolling on the streets?"" Every one of these young brave men and women will tell you, ""Yes."" So the mood is changing, even within those who are the brave young men and women that are serving our country. AMANPOUR: Will you ratify the START treaty? PAUL: I think we need to have more discussion on it, but it doesn't sound like that I'm probably going to be in favor of that. AMANPOUR: It doesn't sound? PAUL: We're going -- we're going to have a discussion about it. AMANPOUR: Wouldn't it be a good thing to have more nuclear treaties with the Russians? PAUL: Well, I mean, some of it has been good. I mean, some of it under George W. Bush... AMANPOUR: That would save money, too, wouldn't it? PAUL: ... under George W. Bush, we did reduce armaments. And I think you have to -- some of it is the devil's in the details there, and I need to know more about it before making an immediate decision. AMANPOUR: Well, we hope to have you back, and we'll get more details from you next time. AMANPOUR: Senator-elect Rand Paul, thank you very much for joining us. AMANPOUR: And the Bush-era tax cuts expire at the end of this year. If Congress doesn't extend them, taxes will go up for everyone. One man says that would be a good thing. David Stockman was the budget director for President Ronald Reagan. He criticizes his party for sticking with the tax cut mantra, and he joins us this morning. Also, Congressman Mike Pence, a senior House Republican leader who takes the opposite view. Welcome to both of you. Thank you for being here this morning. AMANPOUR: Let me first ask you, Representative Pence, you have stepped down, you're planning to step down from your leadership position. Are you running for president? PENCE: Well, let me say, two years ago, I was asked to serve in a leadership position in the Congress, which after spending most of my career fighting runaway spending under Republican control was something as a surprise to many. But I took it because I thought we had an opportunity to lead our -- our party back to a majority. And I took the job. I believed if we returned our party to the practice of conservative principles on Capitol Hill, we could win back the Congress. This week's historic victory for conservative values for the American people is an -- in my judgment, a fulfillment of my commitment. And so now my family and I are going to take our time to prayerfully consider ways that we can serve our state and serve our nation in the years ahead. AMANPOUR: Very quickly: Would you run for president? PENCE: Well, look, we've been very humbled by the encouragement we've received back in Indiana and around the country. And we're intent on taking the coming weeks to really prayerfully consider that, to wait on the Lord, to seek counsel. And after the first of the year, we'll make a decision. AMANPOUR: Or governorship? PENCE: Well, we -- as I said, we've gotten... AMANPOUR: So when can we hear your decision, after you've done all that consultation? PENCE: Well, we frankly -- we've frankly been very humbled by the encouragement we've received back in our beloved Indiana and around the country, but we're going to take the holidays here. And as I said, we're going to reflect on it. AMANPOUR: All right. Well, when you're going to... PENCE: And our question will be, where can we make the most difference for what matters most to us? And what called me to public service back when the -- back in the Reagan administration, when I first ran for Congress, was... AMANPOUR: We're going to ask you about that because... PENCE: ... a commitment to conservative values. AMANPOUR: ... because apparently Ronald Reagan was your political idol, so we'll ask you a little bit about that. AMANPOUR: Still is, OK. Well, we're going to ask about his economic philosophy with the man who engineered it. Well, so, David Stockman, former budget director, you have basically said that Tuesday gave voice and gave further voice to what you call the big lie. STOCKMAN: Exactly. This is not 1981. This is not morning again in America. We've drifted now for 30 years. Both parties, unfortunately, became free lunch parties, the Republicans cutting taxes every time they had a chance, never doing anything about spending, and the Democrats digging in to defend everything that was there. As a result, we now have this massive deficit. Today, the gross public debt is $14 trillion. The first thing we did when we walked into the White House in 1981 was struggle with raising the public debt to $1 trillion. So in that 30 years, the public debt has gone up 14 times. Our economy is only four times larger. We're losing the race. And we're now becoming the banana republic finance, printing -- the Fed, these mad men who are out of control at the Fed, are printing new money, equal to 100 percent of the debt that we're issuing each month. This will not end well. It's -- it's going to end in a disaster. AMANPOUR: Right. And you're saying a tax increase and entitlement cuts are the only possible policy tools right now? STOCKMAN: It's built into the math. I think, you know... AMANPOUR: But this gentleman here is saying, no, correct? I mean, you don't want to cut any -- raise any taxes. You want to extend the tax cuts. PENCE: Look, I don't think higher taxes are going to get anybody hired. I don't -- I think raising taxes in the worst economy in 25 years is a profoundly bad idea. But can I say what I agree with David on? PENCE: You know, I opposed the Medicare prescription drug entitlement. I opposed the Wall Street bailout. I opposed the stimulus bill. I -- I think this week's election was a historic rejection of American liberalism and the Obama and Pelosi agenda. The American people are tired of the borrowing, the spending, the bailouts, the takeovers. So to that point -- I disagree with David strongly on any tax increase. But to his point... AMANPOUR: But the math isn't there. PENCE: ... both parties have failed the American people and have allowed this city to -- to -- to be -- to expand spending beyond any reasonable expectation... AMANPOUR: But, sir, with all due respect... AMANPOUR: ... what you just said was the campaign -- campaign slogan. Now it's time to legislate. You have a new Congress. You have a new reality. You have a huge budget deficit, a massive national debt. And what I'm trying to figure out is, where, beyond what you've been saying in the campaign about, you know, less government, less spending, where you're going to make big cuts? And do you agree that there will, after a period of time, perhaps, need to be tax increases? PENCE: Well, look, Republicans have put on the table -- and continue to put on the table -- our commitment to change the fiscal direction of Washington, D.C., to put our national government on a pathway toward a balanced budget. The president yesterday called for a spending freeze. Well, we -- we think we ought to go back to pre-stimulus, pre-bailout levels and freeze there -- there's been an 84 percent increase in domestic spending since this administration took office. We've got to roll back there. That will save $100 billion in the first year. How about a net hiring freeze on Capitol Hill? And let me anticipate -- David makes the point -- absolutely, for Americans under the age of 40, we've got to put everything on the table in the area of Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security. We have got to reform these entitlement programs. They are threatening the fiscal vitality of future generations of Americans. AMANPOUR: Is that enough? STOCKMAN: Well, no, not nearly enough. The point is, we're now in real-world governance. And you don't get 100 times at bat. The Republicans have been at bat for 30 years, and they've whiffed on everything. Social Security needs to be means-tested right now, not for benefits in 2030, right now, for the top one-third of beneficiaries who have private income that they've earned over their lifetime. We need to drastically scale back Medicare. And the Republicans expanded it. And I appreciate what Mike is saying, but there's no track record of a willingness to take on the doctors, the pharmaceutical companies, the scooter chair manufacturers, who are everywhere. So we need to take on defense, OK? We are now at the point where this -- we're kind of at the, you know, sundown as an imperialist power. And we can't have credit card imperialism. We can't be the policemen of the world anymore because we can't afford it. We're going to have to cut defense drastically. And that isn't just fraud, waste and abuse. It's force structure, fewer divisions. STOCKMAN: And even if we do all that, we still have to raise revenue. AMANPOUR: OK. Would -- you know, you heard Rand Paul say it wasn't a revenue problem, but you -- and you've also heard some economists saying that perhaps right now extending and -- and -- and increasing taxes in this crisis right now, immediately, might not be the most wise thing. What are you saying? STOCKMAN: The crisis will be with us for the next 5 to 10 years. We've had a debt spree for 30 years. The economy has been badly injured. It is sunk under the weight of $50 trillion of debt that we've created publicly and privately. The recovery is over. It was weak; it was tepid. What we have now is day-to-day, 1 percent to 2 percent growth, if we're lucky. And so therefore government has to focus on paying its bills and not micromanaging or simulating the economy. PENCE: But the way we're going to put our fiscal house in order is you have to cut spending now. Everything has to be on the table. I've been battling against runaway spending under both political parties throughout my 10 years in Congress. That's a given. But you can't balance the budget on 9.6 percent unemployment. You can't balance the budget on a struggling economy. The last thing we should do is allow a tax increase on job creators in this country to take effect in January or, as David suggests, a tax increase on every American. And let me take one point... AMANPOUR: What will happen when Congress comes back in lame-duck? What will happen with this tax battle... PENCE: Before we get -- look, David Stockman is, you know, he's a really famous guy and a thoughtful guy. I just disagree with him vehemently and I, frankly, have for about 30 years. David believes that every tax increase equals a revenue increase, but that's not true. Anybody who is familiar with the historical data from the IRS knows that raising income tax rates will likely actually reduce federal revenues. AMANPOUR: Let me ask David... PENCE: So if we raise taxes, the American people are very likely going to -- the top 1 percent are going to send less money to Washington, D.C., and that will never get us out of this... STOCKMAN: I just have to respectfully disagree. You will have some loss of revenue because some activity or transactions won't happen, but if you raise taxes on paper by $100 billion, maybe you'll get $90 billion or $85 billion. But it's just common sense fact that, when you raise the rates, you get more revenue. Normally, it's a bad thing to do. But we are in such dire shape that we have no choice but to accept the negative trade-off of some harm to the economy to start paying our bills. Otherwise, we're dependent on the Chinese, we're dependent on OPEC, we're dependent on a bunch of hedge fund guys to buy our debt, and this game is about over. AMANPOUR: And, Congressman Pence, you talked a lot about the... PENCE: Raising income tax rates on the top 1 percent will not increase revenues to the federal treasury. AMANPOUR: Well, not -- not according to -- to the budget director, who is the architect of the biggest, most sweeping tax cuts in American history. But the question I have for you is, what about all that -- you know, you all talk about the middle class. But the middle class, we've seen their incomes stagnant, whereas the huge amount of wealth has been accumulated by a very, very small top percent. It's not fair, is it? Is it? PENCE: Well, look -- look, what's not fair is the idea that, at a time when tens of millions of Americans are unemployed or underemployed, that you would actually allow a tax increase on job-creators, a tax increase on their employees. I don't know anybody back in Indiana, in the city or on the farm, who thinks that raising taxes on their small business owner boss is going to put them back to work or get them back to full-time. AMANPOUR: We've got one -- time for... STOCKMAN: Two years after the crisis on Wall Street, it has been announced that bonuses this year will be $144 billion, the highest in history. That's who's going to get this tax cut on the top, you know, 2 percent of the population. They don't need a tax cut. They don't deserve it. And, therefore, what we have to do is focus on Main Street, and that means getting our house in order fiscally, not tax cuts that we can't afford. AMANPOUR: On that note, there's plenty to talk about, and we're going to see it develop in Congress pretty shortly all of this. David Stockman, Mike Pence, thank you so much, indeed, for joining us. AMANPOUR: And the roundtable will be up next and looking back 50 years to another historic election. Stay with us. AMANPOUR: We're back with our roundtable. Joining us this morning, George Will, Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana -- who's retiring at the end of this Congress -- George Podesta, president of the Center for American Progress, former White House chief of staff for President Clinton and also led the transition for President Obama -- hard to believe that that was two years ago -- Matthew Dowd, former strategist for President Bush, and Amy Walter, ABC's political director. Thank you all for being here. Let me ask you all the first question, which is, is there a possibility of compromise going ahead or gridlock? George? WILL: I think there will be gridlock, because the object is to control the presidency in our presidential system, and the presidential campaign has now begun. The first question confronting them when they come back up there in a few weeks will be extending the Bush tax cuts. The Democrats will try and decouple the question of those for under $250,000 and those over; Republicans will refuse to do that. It will either be settled now in the lame-duck session or afterwards and will be retroactive in any case. AMANPOUR: And, John Podesta, who I wrongly called George Podesta -- I don't know what was going through my mind, I was looking at George Will... BAYH: He's been called worse. AMANPOUR: Gridlock or any chance of any solutions in this new Congress? PODESTA: Well, I think you heard President Obama in the days after the election saying that he wanted to try and reach out and find a way to find some areas to compromise. And I think the Republicans now have a responsibility to come forward and be partners in governing, particularly in the House, where they're going to have to put some -- some of their own ideas on the table and not just be the party of ""no."" But, you know, I think we're still in a kind of poisonous political atmosphere, so I don't hold out tremendous hope to see things going forward. I think one of the early tests will be whether the Senate will take up the new START treaty, which has bipartisan support in a lame-duck session. AMANPOUR: Well, you heard -- you heard Rand Paul say he wouldn't vote for it, because, of course, that would be coming in January. Go ahead. DOWD: I think there is a possibility of -- of reaching compromise, whether there's a probability of it. But the interesting thing from a political standpoint, just look at the political dynamics. It is in President Obama's best interest and the people that were just elected, the Republicans' best interests, to compromise and get something done, because the country basically keeps saying over and over and over at each election, ""Do something. Cooperate. Get it done."" And they keep sending wake-up call after wake-up call. And if the Republicans -- new Republicans in Congress paid heed and Barack Obama paid heed, they would get something done. BAYH: I agree with that, Christiane. The question here is whether enlightened self-interest can triumph over the ideological polarization we now have in the country. AMANPOUR: Which you've just written about. BAYH: Well, yes. And it's going to be very difficult for moderate Republicans when they see Bob Bennett taken out in Utah, what happened to Lisa Murkowski in Alaska or to Mike Castle in Delaware, to compromise with the president. They'll face an uproar in their own party. And in my party, many of the moderates were obliterated. So I think we can actually make progress on some things. Tax reform may be one of them, education reform another. But on the -- the big things, I think George is right. There will probably continue to be gridlock, fight it out running up to the next election. DOWD: But ultimately -- ultimately the president of the United States -- I know the Democrats like to say it's the Republicans' fault that we haven't done this and all -- and the Democrats said the same thing about President Bush in his presidency, the reason why there wasn't more compromise, because his -- his fault. Ultimately, I think it's -- it's contingent upon President Obama reaching across the aisle in a real, credible way and trying to bring Republicans along. He has the biggest megaphone. It's up to him to do it. AMANPOUR: I've got to bring Amy Walter -- and I want to -- but I want her to react to this. We're going to put up what President Obama will be saying on ""60 Minutes"" this -- this evening and also what John Boehner will be saying, the next speaker of the House. OBAMA: We were so busy and so focused on getting a bunch of stuff done that we stopped paying attention to the fact that leadership isn't just legislation, that it's a matter of persuading people. BOEHNER: There seems to be some denial on the part of the president and other Democrat leaders -- you would think that the other party would understand that the American people have clearly repudiated the policies that they've put forward the last two years. AMANPOUR: Amy Walter, political director at ABC, what did the voters say as they came out? Did they repudiate one party, both parties? What did they say? WALTER: Well, I want to follow up on both what Matthew and Senator Bayh were saying, which was, you know, the problem with -- with midterm election, wave elections, is that what it tends to do is wipe out the people in the middle. 2006 wiped out almost all -- and 2008 -- almost all moderate Republicans left in the House and the Senate. And the same thing happened in this election, with -- with moderate and conservative Democrats. So now what we're left with is two very polarized parts of this Congress who see no reason to compromise, because fundamentally they got elected by their base. So I think that's a very big problem. The second piece in terms of what's going to happen, who needs to compromise, how does this work, fundamentally, I mean, we can bring Dr. Phil into this debate, we can bring Oprah in about the psychology of all this, but fundamentally it's about the economy. This was a fundamental repudiation, if it was of anything, it was that we have a struggling economy, we have 9.6 percent unemployment. And what voters saw for the last year-and-a-half was a lot of infighting in Washington. They saw debate about issues that, quite frankly, didn't impact them personally. They didn't see the benefits to that. Yes, they saw a lot of money going out the door, that -- you know, Congress writing a lot of checks that didn't come directly back to them. That's a lot of what this election was about. But what they're saying, fundamentally, especially what independents are saying is, if you guys, meaning the Republicans, the new people who are in charge now in the House, and Democrats, control the White House and the Senate, can't figure this out, we're going to throw you all out again. AMANPOUR: Well, there you go. That's -- that's my point again. What did they say? And it's not just giving a mandate to one and just repudiating another. People who I spoke to on the road during the campaign wanted more than anything for both sides to come together and figure out a solution to their problems. WILL: But the narrative of the Democrats, from the president and to the former and perhaps soon to be again Speaker Pelosi, have adopted is, there's nothing wrong with our policies. The election had nothing to do with the substance of government. It was all a terrible misunderstanding because we made some communication mistakes. I gather tonight on ""60 Minutes,"" the president will say he has to master the art of couching his arguments in ways the people can understand, so it's fundamentally a problem with the American people. AMANPOUR: Is it -- is it that? Is it -- is it a messaging problem? Or is it a real political problem of not having brought along the American people? PODESTA: I think the president's real political problem is stuck in what Amy said, the 9.6 percent unemployment rate. He inherited a mess. I think everybody gives -- understands that. But I think everybody is tired of hearing about that. The question is, what's going to happen tomorrow? And he has to have a credible plan to move the country forward, to get jobs growing again, to get wages growing again, and to get the deficit under control. And I think he's going to reach out to try to find some partnership with the Republicans. Whether they're willing to try to work with him on that is still anybody's guess. BAYH: The real problem, Christiane -- the political process is not delivering the results the American people want. We've got systemic dysfunction because of the ideological polarization. Most people want practical problem-solving in the middle. That's not what we're getting right now. So the independents went 8 percent for the Democrats two years ago; this time, they went 15 percent for the Republicans. I think John's right. They're likely to go back and forth until they see the kind of progress they want. AMANPOUR: The tax battle is going to be a big one. It's going to come up pretty soon. Let me just play you what Warren Buffett has said about this, as we heard from Rand Paul, we heard David Stockman and Mike Pence talk about it. Let -- let me just say what Warren Buffett thinks. BUFFETT: We're going to have to get more money from somebody. Now, the question is, do we get more money from the person that's going to serve me lunch today or do we get it from me? AMANPOUR: Well, there you go. That's the question. And this to you, is progressive politics dead? Are your liberal ideas dead? PODESTA: Well, I think that, two years ago, people thought there was an ascendancy. And two years from now, we'll see whether the president can -- can restore his standing with the American people and move the country forward. So I don't think it's dead. I think you had -- you had an electorate that was skewed very much differently than it was in 2008, but he's going to have -- as I said -- to come forward and -- and not only try to find compromise, but I think he's going to have to fight for principle, too. And I think that's where this tax fight is really going to -- that's where the rubber's going to hit the road. He said -- President Obama's answered that question. He said we're going to take that money from millionaires. The question is whether he can offer the Republicans something in exchange. I think one of the ideas that -- that he could substitute for tax cuts for the very wealthiest Americans is perhaps a payroll holiday, which the Republicans have endorsed, which would actually create more jobs. So there's going to have to be some give-and-take, but I think there's also got to be principle underlying that. DOWD: To me, the fundamental problem -- the fundamental problem in this, right now, I think -- and both parties have huge credibility problems on this issue from different perspectives on it -- the problem is of asking people to pay more in taxes to a government they don't trust is never going to work. Until they trust that the federal government can get the job done efficiently and effectively, they are not going to want to put more money in the system. But if you're a Republican, in order to maintain some level of credibility, if you want to extend the Bush tax cuts, in my view, then you have to say, we're going to extend this, but we also have to cut this in order to even the score, because if you want to fight the deficit, you can't do both. BAYH: This is an important point Matt just made. The Democrats, we have to address the deficit. If you look what was driving independents, the people who voted in Massachusetts for Scott Brown, and even to this election, it was the deficit and the debt. The economy, but the fiscal problems. Our solution to the fiscal problems can't only be tax increases. We have to stand for spending restraint, as well. And Matt's point, back in -- in the Clinton time, remember reinventing government? They understood we have to convince the taxpayers, show the taxpayers that they're getting value for their dollar. That's very important. The final thing I'd say, look at the U.K. A coalition government comes in. You've got conservatives coming in. They don't like tax increases there, either, so their solution was 75 percent spending restraint. But once they got that, they then put 25 percent revenue on the table. So a compromise can be worked out. AMANPOUR: Well, yeah, and they're -- they're saying there, for every $3 in tax -- in -- in spending cuts, $1 up in taxes. BAYH: And that's a conservative government. AMANPOUR: Precisely. At all a goer (ph)? WILL: No. What the Republicans will say is, if you extend all the Bush tax cuts, you will still be raising as a percentage of GDP about 18 percent in federal revenues, which is slightly above the postwar norm. The Republicans do not think we have a tax -- problem of too low taxes, but too much spending. AMANPOUR: Let me just go to Amy Walter. Amy, there was a lot -- and we saw a lot of the Tea Party candidates and many of the candidates presenting for election this time were women. But the net result is not more women, is it? Tell us what's happened with the women vote and the women representation. WALTER: Yeah, no, it was very interesting. I mean, the net result, in terms of Congress, there -- for the first time in 30 years, there are fewer women in Congress. But I do think it's -- an important point is, who is visible, the women symbolically who are out front right now, and who are we talking about now, less than a week away from Election Day? We're talking about Nancy Pelosi. We're talking about Sarah Palin. We're talking about the first woman Hispanic elected to the governorship in New Mexico. We're talking about the first Indian-American woman elected in South Carolina as governor, Nikki Haley. So while the numbers themselves weren't particularly good for women, the fact that more women are sitting at the table -- in fact, the other person I forgot to mention is Michele Bachmann, self-appointed Tea Party activist and leader in the House, who is challenging the Republican establishment there for a seat in the caucus. So I think while, you know, we may not see the numbers that have increased, what we do see is more women who are making very important and very -- are very much upfront in this process. DOWD: And I think that's an important point. Though there's less women going to be serving in Congress up the street here, the interesting thing is there's going to be more women serving in governor's offices. The first woman governor of South Carolina, the first woman governor of New Mexico, the first woman governor of Oklahoma. And in those places, where people actually trust the state to do something, as senator, former Governor of Indiana Bayh knows, that people actually go -- they're looking to the state governments much more than Washington, D.C., to solve the problems in their life because they trust it. AMANPOUR: Let me ask about a very prominent woman, Nancy Pelosi. Is it in the best interest of your party that she is taking this leadership fight now? PODESTA: Well, I think that the Republicans spent millions of dollars demonizing her. (UNKNOWN): ... on her own. PODESTA: They're all now popping champagne corks. But I think I'd -- if I were them, I'd calm down a little bit, because she did take the House back from them. She's got the majority in the House. She's -- she's tough, disciplined, a great fighter. That's how she produced the legislative achievements that President Obama asked her to produce. And what she needs, I think, is balanced leadership, and that's still -- that's a challenge that she's going to have to face now. AMANPOUR: Very quickly. We've got 45 seconds before the green room roundtable. BAYH: It'll be a big topic in this town, but (inaudible) American people really won't care. The right will continue to demonize her. But since she's not in a position to actually implement things, that won't matter so much, and she's very good inside at raising money and those sorts of things, so I think it's really a non-issue. WILL: Her caucus will be smaller, but much more liberal, so it will support her. And she will also have the support of the Republicans, who would like her to stay. BAYH: Finally, bipartisanship. AMANPOUR: There you go. We achieved it. And President George W. Bush's book is coming out this week. There are interviews; there's all sorts of reviews. And no doubt, perhaps, you'll talk about it in the roundtable in the green room at abcnews.com/thisweek, where you can also find our fact checks by PolitiFact."	1.0

Scott Walker; Panel Discusses A Lively Week in Politics. THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. [09:00:27] (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): Donald Trump's explosive new comments. DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He's not a war hero. TAPPER: Angering veterans and his fellow Republicans. Is this the tipping point some in the Republican establishment have been hoping for? We will ask Senator Marco Rubio in an exclusive interview. Plus, defending the deal. BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You're going to hear a lot of overheated and often dishonest arguments. TAPPER: The president comes out swinging as he fights for his historic agreement to slow Iran's nuclear ambitions. But is Congress set on killing it? And another Republican joins the race to the White House. Governor Scott Walker hits the trail in a Winnebago. But is he ready for a bumpy ride? GOV. SCOTT WALKER (R-WI), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: ... me a question, I will answer...DANA BASH, CNN SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: But you're not really answering this. TAPPER: The best political team in television will be here to break it all down. (END VIDEOTAPE)TAPPER: Good morning, everyone. I'm Jake Tapper in Washington, D.C., where the State Of Our Union is all atwitter, Republicans and veterans buzzing over Donald Trump's latest comments, this time questioning the heroism of Senator John McCain's five-and-a-half years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: John McCain goes, oh, boy, Trump makes my life difficult. He had 15,000 crazies show up, crazies. He called them all crazy. I said, they weren't crazy. They were the brave Americans. I supported him. He lost. He let us down. But, you know, he lost. So, I never liked him as much after that, because I don't like losers. (LAUGHTER)TRUMP: But...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Let me get to it.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's a war hero. TRUMP: He's not a war hero.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's a war hero, five-and-a-half years as a prisoner...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: He is a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren't captured. OK? I hate to tell you. (CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Did you hear that? He's a war hero because he was captured. OK? You can have -- and I believe perhaps he's a war hero. (END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: Critics are piling on, especially those critics in the Republican establishment who would like to see Trump out of the race, and of course, his rivals.Rick Perry: ""He should immediately withdraw from the race for president.""Jeb Bush: ""Enough with the slanderous attacks.""The Republican National Committee: ""There is no place in our party or our country for comments that disparage those who have served honorably.""Is this selective outrage or will this be the moment that slows Trump's meteoric rise in the polls? Joining us now, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican from Florida, 2016 nominee. Thank you so much for joining us, Senator. I know you have heard these comments from Donald Trump. Governor Perry says these comments disqualify Trump to be commander in chief. Do you agree? SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I do agree. This is not just an insult to John McCain, who clearly is a war hero and a great man. But it's an insult to all POWs, to all men and women who have served us in uniform who have been captured in battle. And this somehow makes the assumption or he's saying that somehow if you're captured in battle, you're less worthy of honors than someone who isn't. It's not just absurd. It's offensive. It's ridiculous. And I do think it is a disqualifier as commander in chief. TAPPER: Now, some Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, have criticized you and your fellow Republican candidates for not speaking out more forcefully and more quickly after Trump's comments about undocumented immigrants. They wonder why this firestorm about McCain and not a firestorm about Mexicans? RUBIO: Well, there was. I spoke against what Donald Trump said. But we have to remember this is a man who spent his whole life saying outrageous things. So, early in his campaign, when he said something outrageous, people kind of said just ignore it and move on, it will go away. This is what he does for a living. I think now, as this has gone forward and he's become a more covered candidate and people pay more attention to him, it's required people to be more forceful on some of these offensive things that he's saying. But I did -- not only did I say that what he said about Mexicans is not just inaccurate, it's offensive, it's not true, and it's also offensive. But what he said yesterday, of course, is offensive about John McCain and inaccurate about John McCain, but it actually is offensive to all POWs, the men and women who serve us in uniform, especially those who have served time in the hands of enemy captors and who are worthy of our admiration and respect. TAPPER: Let's move on and discuss the deal President Obama announced to try to contain Iran's nuclear ambitions. Governor Scott Walker says he would rip up this deal on day one, Governor Jeb Bush says the next president would actually have to consult with his Cabinet and allies before throwing the deal out. What would President Marco Rubio do? RUBIO: Yes. Well, I think what people have to understand is that the American portion, the U.S. portion of the sanctions were passed by Congress. They are in the law today. The way the president is going to lift those sanctions is by the use of a national security waiver. The next president of the United States simply has to undo the use of the waiver.[09:05:08] And the sanctions are already in place. And they would be reinstated. And that's what I would do as president. You don't need to have a Cabinet fully formed to do that. In fact, I'm telling everyone now that, if I'm elected president of the United States, we will not use the national security waiver to hold back U.S. sanctions against Iran, especially not as a result of this flawed deal that he's pursuing. TAPPER: The deal, as you point out, lots of people can poke holes in it, lots of people can point out flaws. The Obama administration says, what's the alternative? They argue that this deal, and the sanctions, depend upon international cooperation.The Russians and Chinese were already talking about getting rid of sanctions. Is it not possible that this is simply the best deal any American president could have gotten? RUBIO: No, I don't think that's true. I think that the sanctions were actually forcing Iran to the table. I think we should have asked for a lot more. The sanctions -- this deal violates promises the president made to the American people on multiple fronts. It is not an anytime/anywhere inspection system. It is an inspection process that will require arbitration over a 24-day period or longer that Iran can fight against and delay things. It actually doesn't have a snap-back provision. It says if, in fact, sanctions are ever reimposed because Iran violates the constricts of this deal, any of the contracts that are already in place get to stay. It will only be sanctions on future contracts. So, it doesn't have a really -- it doesn't have a real snap-back provision. It also, by the way, requires us to help Iran technically, economically, develop themselves as a country and become a stronger regional power. That undermines our relationships with our Arab allies in the region and, of course, the state of Israel. And we could spend all day going through the different dynamics of this deal and how it doesn't go nearly far enough and I think almost guarantees that there will now be an arms race in the Middle East. TAPPER: But what would President Rubio do if allies didn't agree with it, which is what it sounds like the Chinese and Russians, the position they were taking? Would you impose sanctions on China or India for not sanctioning Iran? RUBIO: Well, first of all, I wouldn't call China and Russia allies. And, second, I would not -- our foreign policy as a nation is not subject to what China wants to do or Russia wants to do or the E.U. wants to do or anybody wants to do. We have our own foreign policy. It needs to be in the national security interests of the United States. I would never have entered this negotiation unless we understood up front that Iran was going to stop enrichment activities, was going to stop their ballistic missile capabilities, and was going to stop sponsoring terrorism. And none of these conditions have been met. And so now $150 billion is going to be delivered to the Iranian regime, which they will use a substantial portion of it to arm and support Hezbollah, to help Assad, and to help them carry out all sorts of terrorist activities, this to a government that has the blood of over 1,000 American servicemen on their hands, because they were the ones building the IEDs that killed a bunch of Americans in Iraq less than a decade ago. TAPPER: Let's turn to another matter of foreign policy. Tomorrow, here in Washington, D.C., the Cuban Embassy is going to open. This is, of course, part of President Obama's efforts to normalize relations with that country. You have made it very clear you oppose normalization. You have called President Obama's policy a victory for oppression. Would President Rubio shut down the Cuban Embassy here in Washington? RUBIO: I would end the diplomatic relations with an anti-American communist tyranny, until such time as they actually held a democratic opening in Cuba, allowed people to organize independent political parties, have freedom of the press and freedom of expression. In fact, all these conditions are laid out in the law right now in the Cuban Democracy Act. The president in his opening towards Cuba is violating existing law. He is ignoring existing law. And there are a host of conditions that would have to be met before, under my administration, we would have normal relations with Cuba. And that would include the return of fugitives from American justice that are now in Cuba, and that would require the political openings that I have outlined. And that would also require an ending of the intelligence facilities inside of Cuba by both the Russians and the Chinese that use the island of Cuba to spy against American facilities in the Southeast United States. TAPPER: So -- and -- so I'm assuming, amidst all that, the U.S. Embassy -- I mean, the Cuban Embassy in Washington would be shut down because you would end diplomatic relations.RUBIO: Well, they -- look, they have had an interests section there for years, and that function will continue. I don't think -- other than their parties being better attended, I'm not sure what the difference is going to be between what we had before and what we have now, except that this recognition somehow sends a message to dissidents and others around the world that the United States accepts the Cuban form of government today as a legitimate form of government. I do not. I believe the people of Cuba deserve what everyone else in the Western hemisphere has, democracy. TAPPER: Let's turn to immigration for a second. [09:10:01] I know this might be a bit awkward, because you just defended him very strongly, but Senator John McCain had some not-so-nice words for you in a recent interview with ""The New Yorker"" magazine. The two of you worked together on immigration reform in the Senate, of course.But when asked about your leadership style, McCain -- quote -- ""licked his finger, held it up in the air and laughed, referring to which way the wind blows. He said, 'Rubio backed away from it.'""I wanted to give you an opportunity to respond. RUBIO: That was just John McCain being John McCain, because, at the end of the day, is -- that bill had no chance to pass in the House. I repeatedly warned to the people working with me -- you can go back and see the record -- I told them, if this bill is not stronger on the enforcement front, it will go nowhere. That's exactly how it played out. And, as a result, we have made no progress on immigration reform. I warned everybody about that during that process. Every time I would warn people about it, they said I was trying to unravel the process. I was being honest with them. There was no way this bill was going to pass unless the enforcement aspects of it were clearer and stronger. They were not strong enough. That's why today we have less votes for that bill than we did even two years ago. And that's why, while I continue to want to move forward on immigration, I know that the only way we can move forward on it is to first secure our borders, prevent visa overstays and have an E- Verify system. And only after we do that can we do the other two things I believe we need to do, modernize our legal immigration system and deal with those who have been here for a long time illegally, in a reasonable and responsible way. TAPPER: Let's talk about the way to deal with people who have been here for a long time in a responsible and reasonable way. I want to play the quick exchange you had with a voter last month in New Hampshire. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you support a path to citizenship for immigrants who are in the United States, but are here illegally? RUBIO: I do. But, first, we have to do two things. (END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: And, obviously, those two things, securing the border and the E-Verify system. RUBIO: Right. Right. TAPPER: That's still your position, though, a path to citizenship once those other things have been taken care of? RUBIO: Yes. Well, what I said is, if all we can get is a work permit, it is better than what we have now. There are some that do not support that. But you have to understand what a path to citizenship is. I don't think that's ever carefully explained. Before you can ever be a citizen, you have to be a permanent resident. That means a green card. And you have to be in that status for three to five years. And what I have argued is, if you have violated our laws, you should not be allowed to apply for a green card for at least 10 years. And then, when you apply for a green card, you should have to do it through the normal, regular process, not through a special process created for you. So it could take a long time for someone to ultimately apply for citizenship. But I think that's a fair way to do it. It should not be cheaper or faster to become a citizen by having come here illegally. But, ultimately, it's my opinion -- and I understand some people disagree -- that you don't want millions of people permanently living in this country who can never become Americans. But if the best we can do is to stop at the green card process or at the work permit process, that's still better than what we have now. TAPPER: There seems to be a big chasm in economic policy that came out over the last few days I wanted to ask you about. Secretary of State -- former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took on what she called the sharing economy, companies such as Uber and Lyft that use contractors, not employees. In your book, you have a chapter entitled ""Making America Safe for Uber,"" and you're embracing these companies. What's wrong with Hillary Clinton's push to encourage companies like Uber to offer health insurance, offer benefits? RUBIO: Because she's trapped in yesterday. She's trying to apply 20th century constricts to a 21st century innovative industry. We face this over and over again. We're trying to regulate Internet development the way we regulated telephony, you know, telephone systems 20 years ago. You cannot regulate 21st century industries with 20th century ideas. The pace of innovation is too quick. If I had explained to you what Uber was five years ago, it would have been impossible, 10 years ago, completely impossible. The pace of change is so fast that the ability of government to keep up with it, it just can't. And her take on Airbnb, Lyft, Uber, these sorts of things is a perfect example of someone who's trapped in the past, and cannot understand how much the world is changing, and how much it's going to change in the years to come economically. TAPPER: Senator Marco Rubio, thank you so much. RUBIO: Thank you. TAPPER: President Obama announced his landmark nuclear deal with Iran, but it does not include bringing U.S. hostages home. Why not? I will ask the secretary of state, John Kerry, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [09:18:20] TAPPER: Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, called the landmark nuclear deal announced this week a victory for Iran. Khamenei's endorsement will not soothe critics here in America or U.S. allies such as Saudi Arabia or Israel. As President Obama faces a tough battle on Capitol Hill to defend this deal, its American architects, Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz, insist there is simply no viable alternative. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)TAPPER: So it was just a few days ago that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs testified before Congress that lifting the ballistic missile or conventional arms embargo from Iran, that lifting it would be a horrible idea. That was within the same context of testimony that Iran had killed an estimated 500 Americans. Why is lifting the embargo part of this deal? JOHN KERRY, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We're not lifting it. It has eight years out a 10-year component of the U.N. resolution. Eight years, it will be applied. And we have other U.N. resolutions and other mechanisms for holding Iran accountable on missiles. But the simple reality is, Jake, this U.N. process that started the -- that allowed the sanctions to be put in place in the first place contemplated the lifting of all sanctions once Iran had lived up to its obligations with respect to the NPT. So, if the IAEA found in X-number of years that they have lived up to this, then all the sanctions would be gone. So, we, in fact, succeeded against three countries that didn't think they should have to do anything. So, we have a lot of measures.[09:20:02] And the United States always has the ability to take action, unilaterally or otherwise, with respect to other activities. TAPPER: Why I'm confused about this, Secretary Moniz, is because, when I interviewed you in April, and I asked about the four Americans being held in Iran against their will, three that we know, one we don't know what happened to him, and you said the following:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ERNEST MONIZ, U.S. ENERGY SECRETARY: What I want to emphasize is, this negotiation was intentionally restricted to the nuclear issue, get the nuclear bomb issue off the table, we hope, for a long time. That has other implications. So, for example, things like arms embargoes, ballistic missile sanctions, those stay in place, strictly focused on the nuclear issues. (END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: But that doesn't seem to have been what happened. MONIZ: Well, I think we are -- the part of the agreement that is absolutely critical is that, of course, which allows us to, A, prevent a weapon and to have visibility in to any activity in this -- in this direction. Excuse me.And with regard to the Americans unjustly held or missing, again, the secretary -- I was there -- every meeting, this was always raised, and remains, I think, an area of considerable focus. TAPPER: I don't doubt that for a second. But when I asked you about it, you said, look, this is just focused on the nuclear issue. We're not dealing with anything else, including hostages, including arms embargoes. And it looks like, since that happened, the Iranian got to include something that was extraneous, and we did not when it came to our hostages. MONIZ: Well, of course, the arms embargo -- and I will defer to John, but the arms embargo is something that was directly tied to the nuclear performance. KERRY: It was not extraneous. It was already in there. The arms embargo and the missile were put in when 1929, the resolution, was passed. TAPPER: What do you say when you hear that Prince Bandar, the longtime former ambassador from Saudi Arabia, said that this deal -- quote -- ""will wreak havoc in the Middle East""?As you know, there are a lot of countries, Sunni Arab countries, Israel, that are very worried that this is actually a bad deal for peace in the region. KERRY: Well, we disagree with them very, very much. I disagree with him. But I just yesterday met with the foreign minister of Saudi Arabia, who said on television that if the -- they want a deal, and if the deal does the things -- they listed things the deal does -- then they would feel very comfortable with it. The fact is that the real fear of that region should be that you don't have the deal. If Congress doesn't pass this, if Congress were to kill this, then we have no inspections, we have no sanctions, we have no ability to negotiate, because I assure you the ayatollah, if the United States arbitrarily and unilaterally kills this, you're not going to have another negotiation. And they will feel free to go do the very things that this prevents. TAPPER: I have spoken to a lot of experts, ones who wanted this deal to be good, who were rooting for you, and they say the best-case scenario is that, over the next 15 years, with the $100 billion from the money that has no longer -- that will no longer be covered under sanctions, the Iranians will be closer to the capacity to build a nuclear weapon with the $100 billion that they now will have after sanctions are lifted, and they will have done it all under the guise of international law. KERRY: You see, the reason that's not accurate about what will happen is that, today, we don't have those inspections. I mean, we do now under the interim agreement. But, before the interim agreement, we didn't have them. We didn't have the ability to know what they were doing. And guess what, my friend? Iran had 12,000 kilograms of highly enriched uranium, and -- and that's enough, if they enriched it further, for 10 to 12 bombs. They had it. That's what Barack Obama was dealt as a hand when he came in, 19,000 centrifuges already spinning, a country that had already mastered the fuel cycle, a country that already was threshold, in the sense that they are only two months away from breakout. So, we're expanding that breakout from those two months to one year for 10 years and longer. And we have lifetime inspection, adherence to the IAEA, adherence to the advanced protocol, 25 years of tracking and monitoring their uranium, from mining, to milling, to yellow cake, to gas, to centrifuge, to waste. That's unprecedented. And we would not have had that without this agreement. TAPPER: Last time I saw you, sir, I did ask if you had any inklings of getting back in the presidential campaign... KERRY: None. TAPPER: ... mode. KERRY: Zero. (CROSSTALK) KERRY: Absolutely none whatsoever. I have a great job. We have a lot of work to do in the next year-and- a-half, and I'm looking forward to it. TAPPER: That's about as close to Shermanesque as I think it gets. (LAUGHTER) TAPPER: Thank you so much. I appreciate it to both of you.KERRY: Thank you. You're welcome. (END VIDEOTAPE)TAPPER: When we come back: the newest Republican presidential candidate, Governor Scott Walker, cruising in his Winnebago through Iowa, though that is not to say he doesn't hit a speed bump or two. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WALKER: I don't have an opinion on every single issue out there. I mean, to me that's -- I don't know. I don't know the answer to that question. (END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)[09:29:25] TAPPER: Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker entered the presidential race this week at the top of the polls in neighboring Iowa, at least, the first-in-the-nation caucus state, where his Midwestern roots and conservative positions seem to be resonating. He spent this week crisscrossing the Hawkeye State in a Winnebago, with CNN's own Dana Bash in tow -- Dana.BASH: Well, Jake, I was, in fact, invited on Scott Walker's R.V. He was racing between campaign stops in Iowa. And while we were there, I asked him about his comment that he would tear up the Iran nuclear deal on day one of his presidency, and whether that's realistic. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BASH: Would you be willing to go ahead and do away with this deal, increase sanctions, even if all of the other allies around the world, really, were opposed to that? GOV. SCOTT WALKER (R-WI), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Yes.And I think it's that bad of a deal. It's a bad deal for us. It's a bad deal for Israel. It's a bad deal for the region.I will not -- it's not just the starting gun, it will accelerate the nuclear arms race, and it is a powering Iran to do what they're going to do by lifting the sanctions, giving them credibility in the world, not only emboldens the problems that we have in terms of the illicit nuclear infrastructure but this is the leading state sponsor of terrorism.BASH: But the U.S. can't lead in a vacuum, right? WALKER: No. And we certainly would not want to.Our intention would not be to do it alone. I would seek to get the support of Congress not just to reinstate the existing sanctions, but to replace more crippling ones (INAUDIBLE) I think if America would lead and make the case as to why these sanctions are needed and why we need to petition in that regard (INAUDIBLE) -- (CROSSTALK)BASH: The reason the sanctions were so beneficial and so effective, is because the whole world joined in on them. WALKER: Exactly. BASH: If the U.S. was going it alone with sanctions, Iran would say, all right, U.S., whatever, we can, you know, still trade with everybody else. So it wouldn't really work, would it? WALKER: Well, I mean there are still fundamental parts related to the United States. And again the United States putting sanctions, it would have an impact on them. So they'd have to consider what impact it would have on relations that they do with Iran and what that would impact to have on their own account. BASH: Earlier this week you said that the Boy Scouts of America should keep its ban on gay leaders because the policy protected children and (INAUDIBLE) scout values. And then your campaign clarified to say that it was really protecting the scouts from the political and media discussion about that.I'm having trouble understanding that. What -- at the end of the day what is your position? WALKER: I'm not talking about personal protection. I'm talking about -- for me the reason why I didn't have a problem with it is I just think it pulled scouting into a whole larger political and cultural debate as opposed to saying scouting is about camping and citizenship and merit badge and service awards instead of pulling all these other issues out there. And I just hope that they (ph) can (ph) stay focused. That's all. BASH: So, but should there be a ban on allowing gay men to be scout leaders? WALKER: That's up to the people who run the boy scouts.One thing that people find unique, I guess, whether you like it or not, is I actually answer questions. People ask me a question, I'll answer a question -- BASH: You're not really answering this one. WALKER: Sure. I said in this case that's what I thought. I thought the policy was just fine. BASH: OK.WALKER: I (ph) was (ph) saying (ph) when I was in scouts it was fine. You're asking what should the policy be going forward? It should be left up to the leaders of the scouts. BASH: Do you think that being gay is a choice? WALKER: Oh, I mean I think -- that's not even an issue for me to be involved in. The bottom line is, I'm going to stand up and work hard for every American regardless of who they are, no matter where they come from, no matter what their background. I'm going to fight for people and no matter whether they vote for me or not.(CROSSTALK)BASH: On behalf of people is to do that properly you have to understand or at least have an opinion on who they are and where they're coming from. WALKER: But again, I think -- no I don't have an opinion on every single issue out there. I mean to me that's -- I don't know. I don't know the answer to that question.So I'm just saying (INAUDIBLE) I don't know what the answer to that is. And again I'm going to spend my time focused on things that I do know and what I can work on. BASH: You have taken an interesting position in that you say that legal immigration should be limited. Why is that? And does that -- you know some people might look at that and say that's completely counter to what America was founded on.WALKER: What I specifically said is I think priority under legal immigration should be given to the impact on American working families, on their wages in a way that will improve the American economy.That only means people like me who were born here, that means people like the woman I just met in Cedar Rapids, for example, who moved here many years ago, was a political refugee in the Congo and who went through the process to be a legal citizen. She is working here. And I believe for her and for others who were born here, there needs to be a priority given to say we're going to do things that makes sure we put priority on American working families and their wages. Doesn't mean there won't ever be legal immigration. It just says that's where our priority should be. BASH: You want path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and then you say now that you changed your mind. You believe in amnesty. You're running as somebody who is principled and authentic. How do you square changing your positions or at least the impression that your positions have changed?(CROSSTALK) BASH: And let me read you one quick thing. Craig Robinson who is the former director of the party here in Iowa, the Republican Party said, Walker is making Romney look like the model of consistency.[09:34: 43] WALKER: The only issue where I've clearly said I had a position before and even on that as a governor I didn't have a role to play in immigration. I said there should be a path years ago, when I talked about going forward with legal immigration. I didn't talk about amnesty. Like I said in that specific interview I oppose the Gang of Five, the measure that Marco Rubio and others proposed. So I explicitly even then said, I'm not supporting that.But I said flat out in the interview, you heard the beginning of the year, that's the position I have changed on by listening to people. I made it very clear what my position on immigration is.(END VIDEOTAPE)TAPPER: Dana Bash on Scott Walker's R.V. Somewhere between Cedar Rapids and Urbandale.Don't go anywhere, Dana. We're going to bring in the rest of the panel. We're going to talk Trump.Will his latest comments give Republicans an excuse to try to push him off the debate stage? Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)TAPPER: President Obama, girding for a fight as Congress signals it will try to block his Iran nuclear deal. The best political team on television is here to break it all down.CNN contributor Donna Brazile, Peter Baker of ""The New York Times,"" CNN's Dana Bash and Congressman William Hurd of Texas. Thanks one and all for being here.[09:40:00] So, one of the big controversial provisions that's not in this deal is this anywhere, anytime provision. What the administration says, the Obama administration says in response is, look, this 24-day leeway period we can find, intelligence officials tell us that we can find if there were nuclear materials there even 24 days later. You're a former CIA agent. Is that true? Is 24 days, will we still be able to detect?REP. WILL HURD (R), TEXAS: It shouldn't be 24 days. Anytime, anywhere means just that.And you know, the problem with this deal is that there's been absolutely no confidence building measures with Iran. How can we trust them to do what they say they're going to do? And being able to get in to see their facilities at any time, any place, makes sure that we understand what's going on.TAPPER: But is it possible that the radiation detectors will be able to find out if they've been up to no good even 24 days later?HURD: I'm sure in some forms it can but also they can move a lot of -- you can move a lot of material in 24 days, as well.TAPPER: Dana, where is this on the Hill (ph) right now? BASH: In trouble. And when I say that what I mean is I think it seems to be clear, unless the administration really performs a miracle, that there are votes to initially, if they want to, say that they don't agree with this and that it shouldn't go through.The question is whether or not there is a veto- proof majority to do that. And that is what the administration is working incredibly hard to try to push. And you know, this really is a bipartisan thing, because there are Democrats with Republicans who are very much opposed to this.The administration had Jewish Americans in -- Jewish members of Congress rather in the situation room this past week. They're going after, I mean probably they have a list of, you know, every member of Congress who is 5'5"" and under. I mean, they have little groups of members trying desperately to go piece by piece to try to lobby them and they have their work cut out for them.DONNA BRAZILE, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, you know, this is a major international agreement. And with any international agreement there are pluses and there are minuses.But on the plus side I do believe that the administration will be able to keep the Democrats 152 House Democrats signed an agreement basically with the framework saying that they like the outlines of a deal. Now clearly the administration will have to continue to maintain the strong support not just of the Democrats in the House, but also the Senate.I was telling Dana I've been, you know, a great fan and supporter -- yes I'm a fan of the administration, support the president. I've never been lobbied as much as I've been lobbied over the last couple of days. The good news is that they're giving us information. Credible information not just about the inspections, not just about the lifting of the sanctions, the amount of money, whether or not Iran will become a, you know, a good player in the region.They're giving us information and I'm sure they're giving it to those of us who are talkers. They're giving it to members of Congress and their staff as they go back this summer and come back to support this deal. PETER BAKER, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, ""THE NEW YORK TIMES"": (INAUDIBLE) watching (ph) the president this week at his press conference about this and you saw a president who actually was engaging in a fight. He did actually want to talk about criticism when the reporters didn't come up with enough criticism he said hey let's think of some other criticisms that I can address here.You don't see a president actually -- usually... (CROSSTALK)BAKER: ...for criticism (INAUDIBLE). And the reason I think is because, finally, for him, after many months, even a year or more of being on the defensive on issues that weren't of his creation or weren't of his desire to talk about, IRS, or Benghazi, or ISIS, he's talking about something that is at least something he wants to talk about. Something he hopes will be a positive legacy in the long-term. And that's the debate he wants to have. TAPPER: There are a lot of Democrats, congressman, who say Republicans are just going to oppose Obama on anything. And so we're not surprised that they're opposing him on this. HURD: But there's a lot of Democrats that are opposing him on this, as well. I think a bad move was taking this to the U.N. before getting an agreement from your entire -- from the entire government. And that's something that has frustrated a lot of Democrats in Congress.And so, at the end of the day they've never known any information why would the Iranians actually agree to this? They've agreed to these measures before. The IAEA, the U.N. watchdog has done 30 inspections from 2003 to 2010. And they found out that the Iranians were lying to them and that caused four more sanctions going forward. So the Iranians have done this before and we have no information, no confidence building measures that say that they're not going to do it again. [09:44:23] TAPPER: Let's take a quick break.Republicans rushing to condemn Donald Trump after his latest comments anger veterans. But who still has his back? The answer might surprise you.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You know, I recognize that folks in the press love to see Republican-on-Republican violence. And so you want me to say something bad about Donald Trump or bad about John McCain or bad about anyone else. I'm not going to do it.(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: Republican presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz of Texas refusing to pile on to the Donald Trump's scenario as so many of his rivals seem to do. Rather, enthusiastically yesterday, and earlier in the show. Let's talk it all over with our roundtable.Peter, let me ask you this, I could have predicted, I feel, that Trump was going to say something controversial and the entire Republican establishment was going to jump on him. I didn't know what it was going to be. But boy does the RNC want him away. [09:49:41] BAKER: Yes. Because every minute we're talking about Donald trump and some outrageous thing he said, A, it cheapens the process. It makes it look like a reality show rather than a serious, sober contest for the presidency of the United States. And, B, it means we're not talking about all the failings that President Obama, that they'd like to talk about, right?I mean, they'd like to get out there and talk about how this administration and his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, have failed in this way and that way. Instead they're talking about, you know, Donald trump and the latest crazy thing that he might have said. TAPPER: Except to play devil's advocate here, Dana.BASH: Yes.TAPPER: He has brought up the issue of immigration that a lot of Republicans are worried about talking about, but a lot of the base loves to talk about.BASH: Absolutely. I mean, there's a very good reason why he is doing so well. It's not just because he is incredibly entertaining it's because he's talking about something that a lot of the base were frustrated that the other candidates didn't want to talk about.But I just actually want to say something that may be counterintuitive in that, you know, historically you just don't go there. You don't go there against any veteran. You'd certainly don't go there against somebody who was, you know, effectively, you know, in a box for five years.And you know, John McCain can't even lift his arms...TAPPER: Right because he was tortured.BASH: ...because he was tortured and because his bones didn't heal right after his plane crash. Having said that, I think that there's a big part of the electorate, bigger than we think, that isn't that offended by these comments because they are equally frustrated with the John McCains of the world on the issue of immigration.So, I think, you know, a few years ago it would have been lights out Donald Trump. And I'm not so sure that's the case anymore (ph). [09:51:13] TAPPER: Well, let me ask you about that -- Congressman Hurd, I want to ask you as the Republican at the table. I have heard from a lot of Democrats who only 11 years ago in 2004 when John Kerry was the nominee of the Democratic Party (INAUDIBLE) -- let's see if we can show the pictures -- the Republican National Convention.There's somebody with a band-aid that is representing -- mocking John Kerry's three purple hearts and then one of the standard bearers of the Republican Party came on CNN and said this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT DOLE (R), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: With three purple hearts and never bled that I know of. And they're all superficial wounds.(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: And Bob Dole went on to later kind of walk those comments back a little. But is there a double standard here? Republicans they say, there's no place in our party or country for comments that disparage those who have served honorably. Well, unless you're a Democrat. HURD: You don't criticize anybody's service. Somebody that is willing to go overseas, put their lives in harm's way in order for all of us to sleep well at night, you don't disparage that. I don't care what party you're in. TAPPER: Donna?BRAZILE: I totally agree with the congressman. Yet, I remember 2004.But look, I think the Republicans are struggling with excommunicating Donald Trump and some Republicans are trying to embrace him. Just in case he drops out, they want to, you know, be able to accrue those votes.They have a real branding problem with Hispanics and they have been working on it for years the Republicans. And now -- here comes this big celebrity. He's a celebrity now.TAPPER: Sure.BRAZILE: But he's a celebrity with a huge following because he's standing up to the establishment, but he's also blocking I think some of the sunshine that some of the other Republicans like Mr. Kasich, Mr. Rubio and others, they would like to have this moment in the sun so they can qualify for the first debate.TAPPER: So, let me turn to another inter party warfare which is (ph) the (ph) Democratic Party. There was a Netroots Nation convention, a gathering of liberal activists in Phoenix and there was a moment where one of the Democratic presidential candidate former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley was shouted down when he said ""all lives matter"" and a question about, Black Lives Matter. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARTIN O'MALLEY (D), FORMER BALTIMORE MAYOR: Every life matters and that is why this issue is so important. Black lives matter. White lives matter. All lives matter.Black lives matter. White lives matter. All lives matter.(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: I read a column on a liberal blog saying that he was using the language of white supremacy. Can you explain why people would be mad at somebody saying, all lives matter? BRAZILE: Well first of all I don't approve and I don't condone shouting down anyone because I do believe that when these speakers -- these presidential candidates come, they want to be heard. And clearly I like the back and forth.That being said, there's a real cry out there, a cry from a generation that wants to be heard, that feel crushed by the street violence that they're experiencing, and the unjust police tactics that they are also experiencing. So they want to be heard and they don't want to be grouped together with ""all lives matter.""They want candidates to understand their pain, their frustration. They've attended too many funerals, and they are not going to allow candidates to come in and pander without addressing these issues. One in particular is the woman who was killed while -- I don't know the circumstances, so I apologize for that.TAPPER: Ms. (ph) Bland (ph) found dead --(CROSSTALK)BRAZILE: Ms. Bland who was really one of the heroes behind the Black Lives Matter. So, there's a lot of frustration.And I would advise candidates, Democrats and Republicans to figure out what's going on. Because if they decide to go on the stage and not address these issues, they will shout them down.[09:54:52] TAPPER: Figure out what's going on, good words to live by. Peter, Donna, Congressman, Dana, thank you so much.After the break, join me at my giant wall of cartoons for this week's ""State of the Cartoonion.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)[09:59:02] TAPPER: Over the weekend, the president and his family took in the awesome hip-hop Broadway musical ""Hamilton"" based on the life of the first treasury secretary Alexander Hamilton, long remembered for his death by duel with Vice President Aaron Burr. But the most persistent reminder of Hamilton's place in history is now up for debate and he may have to pay the price.This week's ""State of the Cartoonion.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER (voice-over): American currency from your George Washingtons to your Ben Franklins. It seems you don't have to be president to get on a greenback, you just have to be an old dead white guy, historically important, of course.But now we're told the U.S. government is moving to bring a woman into the mix. We're told it will start with the $10.00 bill, founding father Alexander Hamilton will have to share it with some lucky female historical figures. But others dream of more permanent replacements. [10:00:00] There might be something poetic about replacing President Andrew Jackson nicknamed Indian Killer with Sacagawea, who accompanied Lewis and Clark as a guide, an (ph) interpreter.On the rarely used $1,000.00 bill is progressive icon President Woodrow Wilson. He was also something of a nasty racist. Let's put his contemporary suffrage Alice Paul on that bill. And while we all love Benjamin Franklin it's pretty clear he already gets plenty of love.What if abolitionists and women's rights activists Sojourner Truth were to be on the (INAUDIBLE). It has a nice ring to it. It's all about the Sojourners baby.(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: Thanks for spending your Sunday morning with us.""FAREED ZAKARIA GPS,"" starts right now."	1.0

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.[19:00:10] ERIN BURNETT, CNN ANCHOR: OUTFRONT next, Donald Trump expanding his campaign stuff cancelling events in California and Colorado. He is going all in on must-win New York. Is he hearing Ted Cruz's footsteps?Plus, Ted Cruz speaking to CNN this hour on how he'll win the nomination. Why he is not getting support from his own Capitol Hill colleagues? That interview right here OUTFRONT.And the breaking news, Bernie Sanders moments ago addressing the ugly battle over whether Hillary Clinton is qualified to be president. Let's go OUTFRONT.Good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, bracing for battles. Donald Trump today making it clear he is gearing up for what will be an ugly fight ahead. Naming longtime political operative Paul Manafort as his convention manager. He also unexpectedly cleared his schedule. Usually he is doing two or three states at a time. He has cancelled his events in California, cancelled his events in Colorado focusing all his time and energy on New York.Also today, New York's most prominent Republican, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani telling two New York newspapers he is voting for Donald Trump, but he is not calling it an endorsement. A bit strange there. Trump's top rival Ted Cruz meantime facing an uphill battle in New York, visiting a Matzah Bakery in Brooklyn today after waking up to a tabloid headline suggesting he leave town on a train that shall we say is not an actual subway line.Our Dana Bash sat down for one-on-one interview with Senator Cruz late today. You'll going to see that full interview in just a moment. I want to go though first to Sara Murray.And Sara, significant here, Donald Trump, you know, sort of originally had been, well, New York is my home state. I love it. But I'm going to be able to go out to California and other states and campaign. He has now canceled those appearances and is focusing all in on New York. How much should we read into that?SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Erin, I think in this case it is a significant and strategic change. What this tells though is the Trump campaign is sort of tabling this fly-around strategy that they have used until this point and they are going all in on New York. This is a state where 95 delegates are at stake. And as we're talking to members of Trump's campaign in New York, they made it clear that they want to win all of them. They want to be able to sweep the 95 delegates in New York. And Erin, that's a tough thing to do. It means you need to get over 50 percent. Not just statewide, but in this Congressional districts. It involves a lot of legwork.And I think that's why we're seeing the Trump campaign revamp their schedule. Now, it is worth noting they have not released what their new schedule will be. So, he didn't have any events today. It's not clear what it going to be on his schedule tomorrow. So far there is nothing. This is when he was going to be in California. And it also mean that they are making choices to skip things like the convention that going to be in Colorado this weekend where there are 37 delegates who are going to be selected. Right now Ted Cruz will be there. Donald Trump will not. So we'll see if this new strategy pace off for them -- Erin.BURNETT: All right. It's going to be very significant to see what that schedule is over the next few hours. Sara, thank you.Ted Cruz in the meantime intent on posing a challenge to Trump on Trump's home turf saying, he think he can do it in New York. Just moments ago, our chief political correspondent Dana Bash sat down with Ted Cruz right here in New York for a one-on-one interview. And here it is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Senator, thank you so much for sitting down with me.SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's great to be with you, Dana.BASH: I'm sure you've seen this. I'm glad you're laughing, because the New York daily news gave you a warm welcome. They actually gave you some helpful hints to take the f-train and the u-train.CRUZ: Very helpful.BASH: Very helpful. In all seriousness, you know, when you saw this, what did you make of this?CRUZ: I laughed out loud. Look, I have never been popular with left wing journalists or tabloids. And frankly, that's not my target audience. You know, I'll tell you the energy and support we're saying we just did a wonderful gathering here. I came to Brooklyn and baked some Matzah and just spoke with the Russian Jewish community and the Orthodox community and Hassidic-Jewish community and the energy and enthusiasm we had here today was tremendous. And yesterday, it's interesting.Apparently the liberal journalists didn't like me being there. But in the Bronx yesterday, I had the opportunity to sit down with pastors, sit down with Hispanic pastors, African-American pastors. It was actually an event that was hosted by a Democratic state senator, Senator Ruben Diaz. He is a Democrat. He is a pastor. He is an African-American Hispanic and he invited me there and we had a wonderful gathering of pastors agreeing that we need to stand for shared values. So the reporter may not be happy, but I'm much more focused on the citizens.BASH: But in all seriousness, the origin of this, which again I'm glad you're having fun with. Because it is a New York tabloid, is that you several months ago disparaged New York value. I was upstate with you earlier today. And I'm well aware and talking to voter there that in Upstate, they got what you were saying.CRUZ: Yes. Yes.BASH: That you're talking about liberals in New York City --CRUZ: Sure. Sure.BASH: -- and that conservatives in Upstate New York are quite different. But you understand how a sound bite is played and how your opponent is using it against you here. Any regrets in using that terminology now that you're asking for New York voters to vote for you?[19:05:11] CRUZ: Not remotely. Because everyone in New York and outside of New York knows exactly what I meant by that. And it is the liberal values of Democratic politicians who have been hammering the people of New York for decades. They've suffered under these liberal values. It's been politicians like Governor Andrew Cuomo, like Hillary Clinton, like Mayor Bill de Blasio. You know, Andrew Cuomo told New Yorkers, said if you're pro-life, if you believe in traditional marriage, if you believe in the Second Amendment, there is no place for you in the state of New York. It was striking yesterday when I was meeting with Senator Diaz, and a Democratic senator. He said my own governor said there is no place for me as a pastor. And someone who believes in life. I mean, that is a liberal intolerance, which the people of New York I think are tired of.BASH: You talked about the fact that you are coming to talk to me now. We're sitting in a Jewish community center, in an ultra-Orthodox part of New York. You just helped make Matzah with young children. I've interviewed you a lot of places around the country.CRUZ: Sure.BASH: This is not one I expected, to be honest with you. Do you feel like you have been successful as a, you know, a Christian from Texas reaching out to the Orthodox Jews in New York?CRUZ: Very much. We've got tremendous support in the Jewish community. Tremendous support especially in the Orthodox community. I've been privileged to speak at synagogues all over the country. And in particular, to focus on defending religious liberty, which has been a passion of mine my entire life. And focus on standing with Israel.BASH: Coming here in New York, even the fact that you're campaigning in the New York Republican primary, is this how you plan to rack up delegates here, find pockets of support, like you know, here in the Orthodox Jewish community or in Upstate New York?CRUZ: We are building a big tent, and we're unifying Republicans. You know, nationwide, there are about 65 to 70 percent of Republicans that get that Donald Trump is not the best candidate to go up against Hillary Clinton. That he loses and loses badly to Hillary. And what we're saying happening all over the country is those 65 to 70 percent of Republicans are uniting behind this campaign. We saw it powerfully in Wisconsin just a couple of days ago.BASH: Okay. So no question you did very well in Wisconsin. And you should be commended for that victory.CRUZ: Thank you.BASH: But do you concede that at this point your only realistic way to get the nomination is at the convention? Not your only mathematical way, but your only realistic way?CRUZ: Not remotely. Look, we have a clear path forward to get to 1, 237 delegates. It's difficult. We've got to win and we've got to win consistently. But I'll point out in the last three weeks, we have won in four states in a role. We won a landslide in Utah, nearly 70 percent of the vote, we've got all of the delegates.BASH: But now you're here in New York and you're in third place, even behind John Kasich. You've got Maryland coming up. You're in third place in the polls. You need 88 percent of the remaining delegates to win.CRUZ: Well, let's see what the voters safe. You know, I actually think the people of New York, particularly Upstate New York, have an awful lot in common with the people of Wisconsin. Very, very similar. And what we're seeing happening across the country, what I hope we'll see in New York is that Republicans will unite.BASH: How actively are you working to convince? A good operation. You understand how the game is played. How hard are you working to convince Trump delegates to come your way on any second ballot should it come to that?CRUZ: Listen, we are working to earn every vote we can, every place we. So we're competing in all 50 states. And we're competing number one to win a primary, to win a caucus, to earn those votes, to unify the party. Our focus is unity, bringing together conservatives, bringing together libertarians, bringing together moderate, bringing together everyone who doesn't want to see Donald Trump as the nominee and doesn't want to hand the general election to Hillary Clinton gift wrapped.BASH: What about those who do want to see Trump as the nominee?CRUZ: Well, you know, it's interesting. Donald has had a floor about 20, 25 percent he seems to get no matter what. As he said, you know, he may be right that he could go out on Fifth Avenue and shoot someone and that floor would say there. But he also has a ceiling. He has a ceiling of 35 to 40 percent that he has a very hard time breaking. The worst day for the entire Trump campaign was the day Marco Rubio suspended his campaign. Because what happened is, over 80 percent of Marco's supporters came us to. And it unified much of the remainder of the party behind our campaign.BASH: Sure, but I'm talking about looking forward to the convention when if there is a contested convention, as you well know, the delegates are bound to whomever they're supporting initially.CRUZ: Sure.BASH: Then after that in a second ballot, many of them are not bound. How hard are you working to woo the Trump delegates for the second ballot?CRUZ: We are doing everything we can.BASH: One of the things that could help you is if you had more support from your own Republican Senate colleagues. You do now have two endorsements. But given how much momentum you say you got out of Wisconsin, how much many of your colleagues really dislike Donald Trump and don't want him to be the nominee, why don't you have more support from Republican senators?[19:10:10] CRUZ: Well, you know, Dana, I recognize that folks in the media focus on Washington. You cover Capitol Hill.BASH: It's not just Washington. It's opinion leaders at the conventions.CRUZ: What I can tell you is the energy and support we're receiving from the grassroots is overwhelming. And let me give you one of the illustrations of the unity we're seeing. We started out with 17 Republican candidates in this field, an amazing, talented diverse field. Of those 17, five are now supporting our campaign. We've got support from Rick Perry, from Lindsey Graham, from Jeb Bush, from Scott Walker and from Carly Fiorina. When you throw in Mike Lee and Mark Levin, that is the full spectrum of the Republican Party, the full ideological spectrum. And what we are seeing, that's the unity it's going take to win the nomination. It's also the unity it's going to take to beat Hillary Clinton. And my focus is on beating Hillary Clinton and poll after poll after poll shows Donald losing badly to Hillary. And poll after poll after poll shows me beating Hillary.BASH: But to get the chance to beat Hillary Clinton, you know how works, you actually have to be the Republican nominee. One of the things that my colleague Manu Raju in the Senate has heard from several Republican senators is that they probably would think about backing you and telling all of their grassroots activists to back you if you would apologize for saying that your Republican Leader Mitch McConnell was a liar. Will you apologize?CRUZ: You know what, Dana? This is why people are so frustrated with Washington. It's the inside battles back and forth. This isn't a game. This isn't about Washington power brokers. This isn't a smoke- filled room. If we want to turn the country around, let me tell you who should apologize. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton should apologize to the American people.BASH: But you called Mitch McConnell a liar, not them.CRUZ: They should apologize to the American people for seven years of economic stagnation, for people seeing jobs going overseas, for wages stuck. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton should apologize to all the single moms who have been forced into part-time work because of Obama.BASH: No apology to Mitch McConnell? Because it could help you.CRUZ: Look, my focus is not on Washington. That ain't going to happen. And if Washington lobbyists want the see that happen, they can hold their breath a long, long time. My focus is on the American people and uniting Republicans behind a shared values and a shared vision. Now I will tell you this. I am happy to praise Mitch McConnell, praise him effusively for his stand, along with Chuck Grassley saying we are not going to hold hearings on a replacement for Antonin Scalia. Mitch McConnell is doing the right thing. Chuck Grassley is doing the right thing. And I'm proud to commend them. I've done so publicly many times. They're doing the right thing and saying that Justice Scalia's replacement should be made by the next president so that the American people have an opportunity to vote and express their views. But we need to be focusing on the American people, not politicians bickering in Washington.BASH: I know we're almost out of time. Just one quick moment that really struck me and a lot of people. At your victory rally in Wisconsin, a lot of your supporters were chanting for your wife Heidi. And she came up on the stage and you had a couple of embraces there seems to be a lot of layers of emotion there. What was going through your mind at that moment?CRUZ: Well, listen, this has been a pretty amazing couple of weeks in politics. I never envisioned that my opponent would attack my wife. That he would go after my wife and my family. And Heidi is a rock. I mean, she is strong and she has come through this unwavering. But it was when I recognized Heidi in our victory speech, the supporters there began chanting ""Heidi."" And it was a powerful moment, just to see so many people embracing her and saying thank you, thank you for putting yourself through this garbage, for enduring the garbage that my opponent has heaped upon her. And that was powerful. And it just -- it made me want to say thank you to her also.And it also made me think, and this is something I think a lot about, about the example Heidi gives to our girls. You know, Katherine and Caroline, they're five and seven. And they're saying number one, they see their mommy attacked by a bully. And insulted and lied about. But they also see that their mommy stands up with a smile and she isn't scared. She isn't intimidated. And they see the people rallying around their mommy. And I hope that becomes an example to little girls across the country, that there is nothing that a strong woman cannot do. And I said many times Heidi is my best friend, and she is.BASH: Senator, thank you.BASH: We appreciate your time. Thank you so much.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURNETT: All right. And OUTFRONT next, Ted Cruz doing everything he can to win over New York voters today, making Matzah in that Brooklyn bakery.Plus, breaking news, Bernie Sanders moments ago addressing his ugly fight with Hillary Clinton. Is he still saying she is not qualified to be president?[19:15:07] And a very angry Bill Clinton today confronting protesters.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FMR. PRES. BILL CLINTON (D), UNITED STATES: You are defending the people who killed the lives you say matter. Tell the truth.(END VIDEO CLIP)[19:19:04] BURNETT: Tonight Donald Trump hunkering down in New York. The Republican front-runner cancelling events in California, Colorado, focusing on his home state instead.Just moments ago Ted Cruz told our own Dana Bash that he thinks he will do well here in New York.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CRUZ: I actually think the people of New York, particularly Upstate New York have an awful lot in common with the people of Wisconsin. Very, very similar.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURNETT: Wisconsin, of course, a state that Cruz just won. And he won it big.OUTFRONT now, our chief political correspondent Dana Bash, plus the Cruz campaign's New Jersey State Chairman Steve Lonegan and Trump supporter Congresswoman Renee Ellmers. OK. Good to have all of you with us.Dana, let me start with you. By the way, speaking of New York, amazing that you were able to get from where you were with Ted Cruz out in Brooklyn here.BASH: You have to be a Jersey driver.(LAUGHTER)OK. So let me start with you. Cruz is saying he can do really well in New York. You know, I mean, being very optimistic about that. Of course, you couple that with Donald Trump seeming to cancel his appearances in further states and put all his eggs in the New York basket. Do you think he really can do as well here as he did in Wisconsin if he is kind of leading in that implication?BASH: No, absolutely not. I mean, there is not a chance. And I don't think that even on their most optimistic moments they think that they can do that well. But what they are trying to do in the name of the game is to keep Donald Trump's delegate numbers down and gobble up as many delegates as they can for themselves. So that is why before I was in Brooklyn, I was in Albany, a suburb of Albany that is more of kind of the Cruz voter. Very conservative. At least the area in Upstate New York where he was. If you he can do well there, maybe get a few delegates in the Congressional district there, maybe a few elsewhere, that is, you know, perhaps a good day for a Ted Cruz in the state of New York.BURNETT: Right.BASH: But to be clear, right now he is third place in the polls. He is trailing John Kasich.BURNETT: And Steve, that's an -- he also keeps citing how he is doing so well in polls against Hillary. Look, in the past three polls, one of them is behind her by nine points. The other two is within the margin of error. So, it's hardly to brag that he is beating her.STEVE LONEGAN, NEW JERSEY CHAIRMAN, TED CRUZ CAMPAIGN: Well, we've come off with two amazing weeks. In Utah two weeks ago the senator won by over 60 percent of the vote. Nobody has done that in the primary yet today. Then we go into North Dakota where we took 18 out of 19 delegates. Now, Colorado --BURNETT: OK. But nobody actually voted in North Dakota.LONEGAN: But we're going to sweep all the Colorado delegates again. And then Wisconsin. Huge victory. So Trump has been losing, losing, losing. Of course he is going to be ahead this the polls in New York. Things haven't recalibrated after the Wisconsin win. I'm not predicting Senator Cruz will win New York --BURNETT: OK.LONEGAN: But he has a remarkable ability to out-perform expectations. We need to do well here. We don't have to do great to win here. It was thought Donald Trump completely. But you know, the Trump campaign is in total turmoil, Erin. I mean, there is a battle brewing within the campaign, there is no guidance, no leadership. They're shooting in all different directions. You don't mow what this candidate is going say next. One position in the morning, one position for lunch, one position after dinner and maybe another before he goes to bed on the same issue. So, this is an issue for their campaign.BURNETT: Renee, a lot to say here, you just heard Steve, total turmoil, that Trump is losing, losing, losing. REP. RENEE ELLMERS (R), DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTER: No, I don't see thatat all. In fact I think what they're doing is working together in a very meaningful way. Thing is strategy from here on out. I think they're making a good move staying in New York. They are doing what they need to do to get the votes.LONEGAN: Erin, I need to say something. And with all due respect to Congressman Ellmers, and I like her very, very much. On the most important issues in Donald Trump's campaign, number one, he is going to deport all these illegal aliens. Illegal aliens. He is going to build this wall. Yet Congresswoman Ellmers has a very strong public position. She wants to give green cards to every illegal alien. In fact, Congressman Ellmers voted against Ron DeSantis (ph) bill to prioritize deporting the illegal alien child molesters in this country. She is the only Republican in the country to vote against it. She also is an opener supporter of TPA, which Donald Trump said he is going to overturn. Now, look, on the key issues his own supporters don't agree with him. That's pretty telling about the whole campaign.BURNETT: Congresswoman?ELLMERS: Well, let's talk about where Ted Cruz is on this issue. You know, last January -- January of 2015, we could have passed a very significant border security bill. But it was members of the Senate and members of the House like Ted Cruz that really put themselves in the way of it and our leadership ended up pulling the bill. There is much that needs to be done on immigration. And I may not always agree on every issue that Donald Trump has, but at least he wants to get something done. That's a lot more I can say that from Ted Cruz. You know, Donald Trump had the success rate that Ted Cruz has of voting no and accomplishing nothing in the Senate, he would not be the man that he is today running for president. And I believe that Donald Trump is going to be our next president because he has a record of success. And Ted Cruz, I'm sorry, does not.LONEGAN: Senator Ted Cruz led the effort to start the Marco Rubio- Chuck Schumer gang of eight amnesty bill by the way. And because of him we don't have that dastardly bill. And by the way, again, Congresswoman Ellmers' vote is the only Republican in the whole country to vote against deporting illegal alien child molesters. This is majorly opposed to everything Donald Trump stands for.[19:24:06] ELLMERS: It is absolutely ridiculous for you to think in any way, any form. But see? This is what comes out of the Ted Cruz camp. The calling names, you know, all of these things. We just heard this great interview where Ted Cruz is talking about, you know, a level of civility and how we should be more sensitive. And here we have his staff basically saying different.LONEGAN: Congresswoman, don't take it different. I respect you when you vote. Your votes are what they are. And I respect those votes. That's what you believe in. But they're diametrically opposed to everything Donald Trump stands for. And that's pretty telling.ELLMERS: No, absolutely not. Because actually what I am for is actually coming to the table in working out the issues. And that's a lot more than I can say for even us as Republicans in Congress. You know, there is a lot of frustration out there in this country. And it's basically in large because of President Obama and his administration. But I have got to say that there's responsibility we have to take as Republicans. And unfortunately, Ted Cruz has been one of those that has led us down a path to mislead the American people.LONEGAN: Look, Congresswoman --BURNETT: Let me ask you. Let me ask Dana a question though. Because you see Congresswoman Ellmers, you know, supporting Donald Trump. And one thing Steve, I know you've been behind Ted Cruz for a while. But Dana, his former colleagues are his colleagues now but other colleagues on Capitol Hill, they still are not rushing to support Ted Cruz.LONEGAN: Oh, I beg to differ.BURNETT: What is though?BASH: Well, you beg to differ because there are some notable exceptions.BURNETT: There are some notable exceptions --(CROSSTALK)BASH: Like Lindsey Graham and he says constantly and he is right that five of his former opponents now support him.BURNETT: Right.BASH: But -- but --LONEGAN: Huge.BASH: But he has -- 40 something, almost 50 -- actually, no, more than 50 Republican colleagues, his fellow Republican senators who have not endorsed him. And I think that that was a telling moment in that interview. Not just because of the fact that they haven't supported him, but because many of them are still miffed that he called their leader a liar from the Senate floor. And the fact that I pressed him to apologize, and he said ain't going to happen. Ain't going to happen.LONEGAN: This is the anti-establishment, anti-Washington. He is a consummate outsider.BASH: He wants the establishment to rally behind him but beat Donald Trump. You can't have it both ways, right?LONEGAN: The establishment is rallying behind the best candidate who is prepared to be the next president of the United States, one who can articulate his issues very clearly, very eloquently, and with force as opposed to a guy who -- whose own supporters don't know what he stands for. BURNETT: I hit pause there. You know, Lindsey Graham by the waysaying he is backing Ted Cruz because the other 15 people he wanted to back are no longer running. But we're going to be talking with Congressman Peter King who says, he would never vote for Ted Cruz later on on this hour, found out whether he would vote for Cruz or Trump when push comes to shove. Now, that interview later on this hour.And next, the breaking news, Bernie Sanders speaking moments ago on whether Hillary Clinton is qualified to be president. And Bill Clinton clashing with protesters in Philadelphia today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: I don't know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack and sent them out on to street to murder other African-American children. Maybe you thought they were good citizens.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)[19:31:08] ERIN BURNETT, CNN ANCHOR: Breaking news: Bernie Sanders not backing down from his accusation that Clinton is unqualified for the presidency, but tonight admits to CBS News he may have gone too far.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You're right. We should not get into this tit for tat. We should be debating the issues facing the American people.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURNETT: Jeff Zeleny is OUTFRONT.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I will take Bernie Sanders over Donald Trump or Ted Cruz any time.JEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Hillary Clinton taking the high road today. For a moment, at least, as the Democratic race devolves into a war of words.CLINTON: Let's keep our eye on what is really at stake in this election.ZELENY: At stake is the New York primary, which Bernie Sanders is fighting hard to win, firing off some of the most personal attacks yet of the campaign over who is qualified to be president.SANDERS: The American people might wonder about your qualifications, Madam Secretary, when you voted for the war in Iraq. ZELENY: In Philadelphia today, Sanders unleashed a laundry list ofgrievances.SANDERS: Are you qualified to be president of the United States when you're raising millions of dollars from Wall Street, an entity whose greed, recklessness and illegal behavior helped destroy our economy?ZELENY: Sanders said Clinton started by diminishing his qualifications. She said he did.It's a rough and tumble New York primary, raising questions about unifying the Democratic Party.SANDERS: I ran a very contested campaign against then-Senator Obama, and it went all the way to the end. We worked really hard. He got more delegates. And so I endorsed him.ZELENY: This map on the wall at Clinton campaign headquarters in Brooklyn is a daily reminder of their lead in delegates.Sanders is vowing to take the fight to the convention, a move that doesn't sit well with Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook.ROBBY MOOK, HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN MANAGER: The stakes are so high. Nobody wants -- nobody in our party wants to see Donald Trump or Ted Cruz become president. I think people will very quickly unify behind our nominee.ZELENY (on camera): But it is different. I mean, she was a Democrat her entire life, and he's not been a Democrat. What incentive does he have to help unify this party?MOOK: Well, that's up to Senator Sanders. He is going to have to make a decision about the role he wants to play.ZELENY: Would it be a mistake for the party to keep litigating this into July into Philadelphia?MOOK: Well, I think at the point it's obvious a candidate has a majority of delegates and will win the nomination at the convention. I do think it will be time to come together. But we're not there yet.(END VIDEOTAPE)ZELENY: So, Erin, after a very aggressive day on the campaign trail, back and forth, this war of words, things are calming down at least a little bit. Bernie Sanders just a short time ago told CBS News that he should not be engaging in a tit for tat. He should be focusing on the issues of importance to the American people.So, both sides are sort of cooling their jets a bit tonight, Erin. But it all starts again tomorrow, another day on the campaign trail here in New York. We'll see how this unity goes with 12 days left before that New York primary.BURNETT: All right. Jeff, thank you very much. And, of course, you know, saying he doesn't want to engage in tit for tat is not the same thing as saying I didn't mean it. I take it back.Joining me now, Bronx borough president, Ruben Diaz, Jr., who supports Hillary Clinton. In fact, he accompanied her on campaign stop in the Bronx this morning. And Nomiki Konst, Democratic strategist and Bernie Sanders supporter.So, Nomi, let me start with you. Senator Sanders now saying, OK, I want to focus on other things, not a tit for tat. But he is standing by what he is saying. He didn't take it back. He has now said twice that Hillary Clinton is not qualified to be president.His campaign manager said she is not qualified because of her foreign policy. He is actually specifically saying it led to the rise of ISIS.Has the campaign gone too far?NOMIKI KONST, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Absolutely not. This has been a campaign about issues from day one. And if Hillary Clinton is fear that this is a campaign that has gone too far, she should be concerned if she is the nominee going up against Donald Trump who talks about hand sizes on stage.I mean, Bernie Sanders has a core set of values. He has talked about them every single moment he can. He is on message.Now, that's not personal. That means when he talks about her record, he is talk about her record, because voters need to know. They're not going to trust the person who is propagating this information out of their campaign to give them that information.[19:35:05] They need to see the difference between the two candidates.Now, Bernie Sanders talks about income inequality. He talks -- you know, one of the things that Hillary Clinton came out today is she attacked him on guns again, right? Well, nobody talks about how in 2000 Hillary Clinton didn't want universal background checks. Nobody talks about the fact that Hillary Clinton's gun record was so conservative in 2008 that Barack Obama called her Annie Oakley and she called him out of touch.Nobody discusses these things. They talk about one vote by Bernie Sanders.(CROSSTALK)BURNETT: Ruben?RUBEN DIAZ, JR., HILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTER: The reality is that it was Bernie Sanders who said that he was going to keep this campaign clean, and he has gone against that promise. And what he says today and what he said yesterday about Hillary not being qualified is absolutely ridiculous. I mean, Nomi, (INAUDIBLE) no one who is a Bernie Sanders supporter cantruly believe that Hillary is not the best qualified candidate when she has been first lady. She has been there for us in New York as a U.S. senator. She's been there as a leader in terms of health care and immigration reform.And the reality is, is that Bernie Sanders is the one who has not voted and has a sketchy record when it comes to gun control.(CROSSTALK)But this issue of right now the conversation and who is qualified, right?KONST: Right.BURNETT: He specifically said he is unqualified. She has not used that word but she essentially said --(CROSSTALK)DIAZ: She never said that she was unqualified.BURNETT: Let me play the exchange on MSNBC of exactly what she said so people can hear for themselves. Here she is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: I think the interview raised a lot of really serious questions. And I look at it this way. The core of this campaign has been break up the banks. And it didn't seem in reading his answers that he understood exactly how that would work under Dodd/Frank, exactly who would be responsible, what the criteria were. And, you know, that means you can't really help people if you don't know how to do what you are campaigning on saying you want to do.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURNETT: Ruben, she didn't use the word ""unqualified."" But isn't she making the same point?DIAZ: No. She is talking about the fact that Bernie Sanders, whether as a presidential candidate or as a U.S. senator for the last 20 years has been talking about regulating banks and dealing with Wall Street. And then when he is asked on an editorial board, how would you solve this?So, it's one thing to talk, talk, talk and make promises that you can't commit to or that you don't know how to solve the problem. And then when they ask you, how would you resolve this?Hillary Clinton for so many years has been someone who's identified the problem and who has come up with solutions. And the same way that people in the Bronx said they felt her, know her, understand that because we've come so long, it's because she has helped identify those solutions.Bernie Sanders should have had the response in the editorial board and that's what she was speaking to.KONST: That's actually not true. You know, this is a meeting that was 45 minutes long. It was so detailed so, much so that ""The New York Times"" came out with a fact check the next day saying that there were quotes taken out of context --BURNETT: This is ""The Daily News"" report that you're referring to.KONST: Exactly.BURNETT: That Bernie Sanders has been widely criticized for.KONST: Widely criticized for it, but the reality is most of the media, most of the people out there have not read it and don't understand economics policy. You know, he said that he has left to it the authority of legislators to legislate Dodd/Frank. You can't go into detail in legislation that hasn't been debated and hasn't been debated in 50 years.You know, she is the one who was against -- she was against Glass- Steagall. She was for repealing Glass-Steagall. And that's what led to the collapse of our economy.So, the record does not match the rhetoric for Hillary Clinton. That's the problem.DIAZ: She never said he is unqualified, that he is unqualified. He is dividing the Democratic party. We have to keep our eyes on the prize and make sure that we're united as a party and beat the Republican in November.KONST: One quick note of that. Brian Fallon was the one who issued the press release saying that we plan to disqualify him, defeat him and unite the party. So, they have started with that comment. It wasn't a press release to just their campaign, it was press release to the world.DIAZ: We look forward to winning and uniting the party.BURNETT: Like Clinton and Sanders, no one wants to give the other the last word. Thank you both.Clinton and Sanders will face off in New York a week from tonight right here on CNN.And next, GE CEO slamming Bernie Sanders, charging that he makes hollow campaign promises. But just moments ago, Sanders fires back. You're not going to believe what he just said.And Ted Cruz saying the Republican Party is uniting around his candidacy. Is it? I'll ask my next guest, a leading Republican who says he just can't stand that guy.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BURNETT: Breaking news: Bernie Sanders versus General Electric. Sanders just unleashing a sharp new attack on GE after the company's CEO Jeffrey Immelt released a scathing and frankly unprecedented op-ed today. The CEO of GE Jeff Immelt wrote this, ""It's easy to make hollow campaign promises and take cheap shots in speeches and during editorial board sessions. But American companies have to deliver for their employees, customers and shareholders ever day."" It continued.And in a statement that we have just obtained here at CNN, the Sanders campaign is firing back, upping the ante, saying that GE is slashing jobs, stashing profits overseas, tossing Americans out into the street and saying that the CEO Jeff Immelt needs to look no further than in the mirror if he wants to know what's wrong.The back and forth started when Sanders came out strong against GE during an interview with ""The Daily News"".(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)SANDERS: General Electric doing a very good job of avoiding taxes. In fact, in a given a year, they pay nothing in taxes. That's greed. That is greed and that's selfishness. That is lack of respect to people of this country.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURNETT: Joe Johns is with the Sanders campaign tonight. He is OUTFRONT in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.Joe, it was an unprecedented op-ed. You now have what seems to be an unprecedented statement from the Sanders campaign. What are they now saying?JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: I think that's true, Erin. This is a statement from Warren Gunnels, policy director for the Sanders campaign.It says in part, ""If the CEO of General Electric wants to know how his company is destroying the fabric of America, he should take a good look in the mirror. He has a retirement package worth an estimated $58 million. Meanwhile, he is one of the leaders of a business group lobbying Congress to slash Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.""[19:45:03] So, this goes way back. They also sent me what was essentially a sound bite of Sanders on the Senate floor, all the way back in 2010 where he was railing against Immelt, GE and its tax avoidance policies among other things.So, clearly, Bernie Sanders is just keeping that team up tonight.BURNETT: I mean, it's not just a one line. It's as you say detailed. And it does, as you just read there, go after the CEO of General Electric, Jeff Immelt, personally, for his retirement package, saying he needs to look into the mirror. This is not just GE, though, in terms of Sanders. He has, of course,been going after the big banks, other major corporations. He has done so again and again, Joe.Given what, this back and forth, though, is this likely to help or hurt Bernie Sanders?JOHNS: I got to be honest with you, Erin. Going around the country, talking to people who support Bernie Sanders, a lot of people are attracted to him because of his anti-corporate, anti-big bang, anti- Wall Street stances.So, as far as a lot of voters, Bernie Sanders is concerned, they say he is doing exactly what he is doing and what he should be doing when he is standing up to corporate interests and CEOs like Jeffrey Immelt.BURNETT: All right. Thank you very much, Joe Johns.And OUTFRONT next, one prominent New York Republican said he would jump off a bridge before he would support Ted Cruz. So if it comes down to Cruz or Clinton, who will we vote for? He is my guest, next.And Jeanne Moos hanging out with New York subway riders today.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)[19:50:33] BURNETT: Tonight, Ted Cruz under pressure fighting to beat Donald Trump in the crucial New York primary. Cruz also, though, under attack from some influential Republican congressmen.Peter King specifically is upset about his criticism of New York values. King says any New Yorker considering Cruz should have their head examined. Cruz, though, not backing down.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Everyone in New York and outside of New York knows exactly what I meant by that. And it is the liberal values of Democratic politicians who have been hammering the people of New York for decades. They suffered under these liberal values. It's been politicians like Governor Andrew Cuomo, like Hillary Clinton, like Mayor Bill de Blasio.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURNETT: OUTFRONT now, Republican congressman from New York, former chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, Peter King.Congressman, a pleasure to have you on. Let's get straight to it.You say you will never vote for Ted Cruz. Why not?REP. PETER KING (R), NEW YORK: I think he's a phony, he's a fraud. Since he's come to the Senate, his only achievement if you want to call it that, is being responsible for shutting down the Senate floor and going on the floor and reading Dr. Seuss and giving a speech about Dr. Seuss and God knows what else for 23 hours on the Senate floor. Since then, this whole remark about New York values.What he said shows how disingenuous that he was talking about liberal Democrats. He didn't say that. He said New York values.I've seen some of these guys like him. They play this regional game. They attack the North, they attack the Northeast, they attack New York. He knew what he was doing.When I think of New York values, I think of the cops and firefighters at 9/11. I think of the National Guard and reserve units in Iraq and Afghanistan. I think of Rudy Giuliani and Mike Bloomberg who turned this city around. That is New York.And also, by the way, we do have -- we have liberals, we have conservatives. New York state was also the home of the conservative party. We were one of the first states to elect a conservative senator, Jim Buckley. Ronald Reagan carried New York twice.So, it is a diverse state. It goes Democrat. It goes Republican. Conservative liberal. We can fight. We can stand together.But when the crunch time is there, New Yorkers rise to the occasion, and we have our values.BURNETT: So, Congressman, though, when you refer to Ted Cruz as a phony and a fraud. Look, you're not the only person who said nasty things about him who he's worked with. But some people who said those sorts of things have changed their minds. One of them, Lindsey Graham. Here he is then and now.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If you nominate Trump and Cruz, I think you get the same outcome. Whether it's death by being shot or poisoning, does it really matter?Ted and I have a lot of differences.(CROSSTALK)GRAHAM: What can I say? One, he's not completely crazy.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURNETT: Could you come around like Senator Graham? Could you ever vote for Ted Cruz if it's Cruz versus Clinton?KING: Cruz versus Clinton, I'd vote for the nominee in my party. That I will do.But in the primary, no, I never could. Listen, I'd have differences with Donald Trump but when you have someone like John Kasich, who's a solid person, Donald Trump who at least achieved something.Unlike Ted Cruz, again, the way he attacked New York, the smart attitude he has, I could not find myself ever voting for him in the Republican Party. If he's the nominee of the party, obviously, I'll vote for him. It's not a lot of enthusiasm, but I'll vote for him.BURNETT: All right. So, in the primary, you're saying you won't vote for Ted Cruz but you'd vote for him in the general election versus Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump, will you vote for Donald Trump on April 19th?KING: Right now, I haven't decided between Donald Trump and John Kasich. You know, I'd have differences with Donald Trump, specifically some of the allegations he's made against John McCain, President Bush, some of the positive things he said about Vladimir Putin, which I thought were just wrong. And John Kasich is a friend.But I really have not decided. But I do have issues with Donald Trump, and I think he has to resolve them.BURNETT: All right. Thank you very much, Congressman King. Pleasure to talk to you tonight.KING: Thank you, Erin.BURNETT: And OUTFRONT next, Jeanne Moos on why New Yorkers went crazy when Hillary took a swipe at the subway today.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)[19:57:46] BURNETT: Hillary Clinton skipped a fancy car and driver, opting to commute the same way millions of New Yorkers do.

Governor Abbott called the special session to address 20 conservative policy initiatives, including property tax reform, limits on state and local spending, and ending forced collection of union dues by local governments, most of which failed to pass the House during the regular session.During the month-long special session, the Texas Senate passed bills on all 20 of the Governor’s initiatives, while the Texas House only passed 11. The House failed to get many important bills out of committees and to the floor for a vote, indicating a lack of will among Republican leadership in the House to advance conservative priorities.Governor Abbott’s top political strategist, Dave Carney, said, “it’s pretty clear the culture of the House is corrupt, that it’s a non-transparent system, that doesn’t allow [its members] to have an up or down vote.”“It has become clear that leaders in the Texas House have lost contact with the core principles of the majority of Texans. Texans deserve better. It is time for a new force for change that will remove these barriers to progress,” said Don Dyer, NLP’s spokesman and PAC treasurer.NLP is the culmination of discussions among a growing movement of organizations, leaders, and voters across the state. Evidence of the need for NLP is illustrated by the passage of resolutions demanding changes in House leadership by 54 (and growing) of Republican party county chapters that together represent over 50 percent of Texas Republican voters.“Our growing list of contributors have been encouraged by the outpouring of support for NLP, and we are committed to find, promote and support a new crop of leaders in the House to ensure common-sense policies for all Texans,” said Dyer.NLP plans to encourage and support new leadership at all levels in the Texas House during the 2018 Primary season and beyond.© 2017 New Leadership PAC	1.0

These are hard-working Americans who want to make their cities and towns a better place and ensure that every American has a shot at the American Dream and the opportunity to live in a safe, prosperous community. To say anything otherwise is further proof that Mitt Romney is detached from the reality of Wisconsinites.But this comes as no surprise coming from a candidate who has joked about being unemployed himself, said he likes firing people and claimed that corporations are people. Obviously, Romney doesn’t get it.Mitt Romney saying we don’t benefit from more firefighters, police officers and teachers is further proof of his philosophy of Romney Economics: tax cuts for the wealthy over investments in our community — the same formula that benefitted a few, but crashed our economy and punished the middle class. In Massachusetts, firefighters were among the many victims of Romney Economics. As Romney made clear on Friday, he doesn’t care about these jobs — but as governor, he didn’t seem to care about their safety either, vetoing millions of dollars for fire-safety equipment and targeting that equipment with a line-item veto.From that earlier call, these remarks prepared for delivery:DNC Communications Director Brad WoodhouseThank you for joining the call today. As you know, last week Mitt Romney showed just how out of touch he is with middle-class Wisconsinites.In addition to joking that he is unemployed, that he thinks corporations are people too, and telling us that he likes firing people, in a moment of candor Mitt Romney said we don’t need more firefighters, policemen, and teachers. These types of statements and this type of sentiment is absolutely shocking.Listening to that, hardworking Americans have to wonder just how much more disconnected from the concerns of middle-class Americans could Mitt Romney be?These are hard-working folks who want to make their cities and towns a better place. To say anything otherwise is further proof that Mitt Romney is detached from the reality of hardworking Wisconsinites and the concerns of their everyday lives.President Obama knows that firefighters, policemen, and teachers are the backbone of a successful community and that they have been hit hard by the recession. On top of creating 4.3 million private sector jobs over the past 27 months, President Obama has given Congress a clear plan that would create as many as one million new jobs and put firefighters, policemen, and teachers back to work. But Republicans in Congress are doing nothing to pass that plan and is leaving a million jobs on the table.President Obama is the only one with a plan to move this country forward and strengthen our economy. Among the first things he did in office, President Obama saved more than 300,000 educators’ jobs and helped states prevent massive layoffs.And he’s making sure they have the resources they need to do their jobs. He supported projects to modernize our children’s schools and smart reforms that give schools and school districts the flexibility they need to best serve students.He also supported hiring programs, provided safety equipment and modernized firehouses and police stations that have helped thousands of police, firefighters and first responders keep their jobs and keep them safe.President Obama understands that when these folks work, it not only helps our children in the classroom and keep our streets safe, but it also gives them more money to spend in their communities at the local shop or corner store.President Obama is working hard to provide solutions. And what is Mitt Romney’s solution to strengthen the economy? Fire more people. Even Scott Walker in Wisconsin said that Mitt Romney learned the wrong lessons from Wisconsin in promising he will make cuts to these jobs.Mitt Romney saying that we don’t benefit from more firefighters, police officers, and teachers is further proof of his philosophy of Romney Economics: more budget-busting tax cuts for the wealthy and fewer rules for Wall Street—the same formula that benefitted a few, but crashed our economy and punished the middle class.And this is the same troubling formula that Mitt Romney put in place as governor of Massachusetts where he asked the middle class to continue to sacrifice more. Romney made drastic cuts in funding to education and first responders, and Massachusetts fell to 47th out of 50 in job creation. Middle class Americans can’t afford Romney Economics: tax cuts for the wealthy over investments in our community is not the formula for a successful community.He’s promising the same solutions now. Make no mistake, though, the American people and the people of Wisconsin are going to continue to see through Mitt Romney’s devastating economic plan. It didn’t work in Massachusetts, it won’t work in Wisconsin, and it won’t work for America.President of the Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin Mahlon MitchellThank you, Brad.I’m Mahlon Mitchell, the President of the Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin, which proudly represents thousands of professional firefighters across Wisconsin and this country.First responders and teachers were among the many victims of Romney Economics in Massachusetts. Romney has made it absolutely crystal clear — he doesn’t care about our jobs. And apparently, he doesn’t care about Wisconsinites safety, either.In his first year as governor of Massachusetts, Romney slashed investments in local aid, costing about 14,500 Massachusetts teachers, cops, librarians and others their jobs.Romney also vetoed millions of dollars for fire-safety equipment. And it wasn’t funding in all-encompassing bill that Romney vetoed. He specifically targeted this safety equipment by vetoing it with a line-item veto.Mitt Romney first cut funding for our coats, pants, helmets and boots – equipment that is essential to do the job and that protects firefighters when they run into a burning building.He went a step further when he cut funding for handheld lights that help firefighters see through the smoke, and the devices that help them communicate with other firefighters.This type of funding would’ve saved more lives by giving firefighters the tools they need to find the victims in a fire, and to track their fellow firefighters to make sure they make it out okay.Even personal-alert safety systems, air packs, tanks and compressors were on Romney’s chopping block. That’s the equipment that literally keeps firefighters alive and breathing while they’re surrounded by flames.Firefighters simply cannot do their jobs without that lifesaving equipment.Mitt Romney made it clear that equipment our first responders needed to keep themselves and our communities safe was not a priority to him. And these cuts were so contrary to the values of the Massachusetts people, that both parties in the State House and Senate overrode these vetoes unanimously.But that didn’t stop Romney Economics. Governor Romney even had the gall to put a stop to building a fire station that would have been a living memorial for six local firefighters who died in a warehouse fire. This would have been important to both the families and the community, but it wasn’t important enough to Mitt Romney.Regardless of what Mitt Romney might think, more cops and firefighters keep our streets safe and our communities protected. It’s a fact, and anyone who says otherwise is completely disconnected from reality.The truth is Romney simply didn’t advocate for the folks who would’ve risked their lives to save him if his house was on fire – and his comments on Friday prove that nothing’s changed.I don’t know a single person other than Mitt Romney who thinks we have too many teachers, too many police officers and too many firefighters in our communities.Our first responders look out for us in tough times, and it’s our turn to do the same for them. Mitt Romney just doesn’t understand that.	1.0

Missouri state Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal, D-University City, wrote during a morning Facebook exchange, referring to Republican President Donald Trump.She quickly deleted her post, but not quickly enough. By midafternoon, the political verdicts of her own party were rolling in:U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo.: I condemn it. Its outrageous. And she should resign.U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-St. Louis: (C)alling for the assassination of the President is a federal crime. ... (She is) an embarrassment to our state. She should resign immediately.Missouri Democratic Party Chair Stephen Webber: The ... Party will absolutely not tolerate calls for the assassination of the President. I believe she should resign.Missouri Senate Democratic Caucus leader Sen. Gina Walsh: (She) should be ashamed of herself for adding her voice to this toxic environment.Republican Gov. Eric Greitens said in a statement: We can have differences in our country, but no one should encourage political violence. The senator should resign.Lt. Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, and state Auditor Nicole Galloway, a Democrat, also called for Chappelle-Nadals resignation.In an interview, Chappelle-Nadal acknowledged she wrote the offending line on her personal Facebook page in response to another commenter before deleting it.I didnt mean what I put up. Absolutely not. I was very frustrated. Things have got to change, Chappelle-Nadal told the Post-Dispatch. It was in response to the concerns that I am hearing from residents of St. Louis. I have deleted it, and it should have been deleted, but there is something way more important that we should be talking about.She added later: I am not resigning ... What I said was wrong, but I am not going to stop talking about what led to that, which is the frustration and anger that many people across America are feeling right now.Chappelle-Nadal said her comment stemmed from frustration over the events in Charlottesville over the weekend, in which a white supremacist protester allegedly rammed his car into a group of counterprotesters, killing a 32-year-old woman. +1 Trumps reaction to the tragedy, which included the assertion that both sides of the protests were to blame for the violence, has drawn criticism across the political spectrum.There are people who are afraid of white supremacists in the aftermath of Charlottesville, she said. There are people who are having nightmares. There are people who are afraid of going out in the streets. Its worse than even Ferguson.According to a screenshot of the now-deleted conversation obtained by the Post-Dispatch, another commenter named Christopher Gagne was writing about a cousin of his who he said was on Trumps Secret Service detail.But, what I posted earlier, I truly believe will happen, sooner ... not later, he wrote.In a subsequent interview with the Post-Dispatch, Gagne said that wasnt a reference to assassination, but to his earlier-stated belief that Vice President Mike Pence will use the 25th Amendment of the Constitution to have Trump removed from office.Damn, Gagne then wrote, now Ill probably get a visit from the Secret Service. He followed that comment with smdh, an abbreviation for shaking my damn head.Chappelle-Nadal responded: No. I will. I hope Trump is assassinated!The U.S. Secret Services St. Louis field office is looking into this, the office confirmed Thursday.Kristina Schmidt, special agent in charge, told the Post-Dispatch that hypothetically in such investigations, agents try to determine intent, to determine if there was a violation of federal law. If there is, then we refer it to the U.S. attorney.Our primary goal is to determine if there is intent and meaning behind it, Schmidt said.Richard Callahan, former U.S. attorney in St. Louis, said that generally in cases involving such threats, we try to distinguish between stupid and (actual) intent. He said the bottom line is the question of whether the person was serious about making the threatened action happen.Another factor, he said, is whether its a person of influence. You look at the persons station in life, whether they might have influence over others.In addition to partywide condemnation of Chappelle-Nadals post, state Rep. Joshua Peters, D-St. Louis, issued a formal request Thursday to the Missouri Senate committee that deals with member ethics asking for Chappelle-Nadals removal from office, calling her an embarrassment nationally for the Missouri General Assembly.The furious responses from Chappelle-Nadals own party might at least partly reflect her history of internal political strife as an outspoken critic of people on both sides of the aisle.First elected to the House in 2004, she served three terms before winning a four-way primary for the Senates 14th District in 2010.In January 2015, she filed a proposal in the Senate seeking the ouster of former Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, for his actions in relation to the August 2014 death of a black teenager in Ferguson by a white police officer. In her proposal, she said Nixon seems only to acknowledge the existence of the African-American community on or about election day.The measure went nowhere. But her attacks on Nixon never dimmed. In a tweet at the time of the protests in Ferguson, Chappelle-Nadal wrote: You dont know s*** because you never communicate. F* you, governor!Shes also tried to exert political payback against her foes. She spent nearly $20,000 on negative ads against Rep. Joe Adams, whom she had defeated in her race for the Senate five years previously.She got into a fight with Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis, at a Lil Wayne concert at Scottrade Center in 2011 over legislation regarding local control of the city police department.Last year, she unsuccessfully challenged Clay, the St. Louis-based congressman, in the Democratic primary.During the most recent legislative session, Chappelle-Nadal focused her efforts on a controversial buyout program for homeowners in the Spanish Village neighborhood of Bridgeton who have been impacted by pollution in the nearby Westlake Landfill.Initially, she wanted her colleagues to approve a $12 million program and threatened to shut down the Senate with a filibuster if it didnt move forward. She backed off when the Senate endorsed a $1 million pilot program. But the House didnt agree and she left the Capitol in May with nothing.Kurt Erickson and Joe Holleman of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.#ndn-video-player-3.ndn_embedded .ndn_floatContainer { margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; }	1.0

This comes just hours after a man was dragged off of an overbooked United Airlines flight when he refused to get off the plane. He was pulled out of his seat and thrown into the aisle as seen on a video released on Monday.The baby, whose name has not been released, was left with a welt mark across his face due to the assault. Eyewitnesses say the little boy was screaming for about 38 minutes straight and the parents were asked by the flight attendant several times to “quiet that annoying ass baby down.”After the 4th attempt to get the parents to comply, the flight attendant erupted into a rage grabbing the baby from the mother’s arms and slapping him in the face. It took several passengers to subdue the United Airlines employee.The flight attendant was restrained in the back of the plane until the Pilot could make an emergency landing in Missouri. United Airlines released a statement saying the employee acted in a way that does not represent their company and has been fired.The little boy is said to be in stable condition with no life-threatening injuries.

That's a problem — and it needs to change.Published onSign in to follow this author56th Governor of New York StateBy Governor Andrew M. Cuomo and Jostein Solheim , CEO of Ben & Jerry’sEmployers can often be hesitant to hire someone with a criminal conviction. Unsubstantiated rumors of increased violence in the workplace, theft, or incompetence often stand in the way of giving someone with a record a chance. Yet employers that do hire formerly incarcerated individuals end up reaping the benefits: loyal employees with higher retention rates, tax benefits, and increased economic mobility for their staff.70 million Americans have a criminal record—that’s 1 in 3 adults. There are currently 2.3 million people behind bars in this country, 95 percent of whom will reenter our communities. 640,000 people are released from prison each year, creating a huge untapped workforce available to fill jobs. Yet, in New York State, 53 percent of people on parole have yet to find a job. Employers are often uncomfortable hiring people who have been convicted of a crime—one study found that, in New York City, a criminal record reduced the likelihood of a callback or job offer by nearly 50 percent.This is a problem. Joblessness is the number one predictor of recidivism—the less likely it is for a formerly incarcerated person to find a job, the more likely it is that they end up back in prison, with all the costs associated with incarceration, including a price tag of $60,000 per inmate per year in New York. These barriers to reentry have a negative trickle effect not only on the lives of these individuals, preventing them from providing for themselves and their families, but on society as a whole. Studies have shown that excluding formerly incarcerated individuals from the workforce results in a GDP loss of $78-87 billion thanks to lost tax revenue, and that if states can reduce recidivism rates by just 10 percent, they could save an average of $635 million annually.That’s why my administration has launched the Work for Success Pledge —an online pledge in which companies, like Ben and Jerry’s or VICE Media, whose VICE Apprenticeship Program hires and trains formerly incarcerated people for production, editorial and creative jobs at the company, commit to consider hiring qualified candidates with criminal convictions. New York is the first state in the nation to develop such a pledge. So far, 80 companies have signed on and shown their commitment to hiring those with a criminal conviction—but we need more to pledge their support! It just makes good business sense.Companies like Ben & Jerry’s recognize that hiring formerly incarcerated individuals and working with suppliers that do the same is important for our business, our culture, and our bottom line. Studies have shown that those with a criminal conviction can often make the best employees—they are retained at higher rates than those with no criminal record, saving companies costs associated with hiring and training, which can be as much as $4,000 per employee. Additionally, companies that hire people with criminal convictions are eligible for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC), which provides a maximum tax credit of $2,400 per employee.Formerly incarcerated individuals are often the most motivated at work. A study of army enlistees found that enlistees with felony records were 33 percent more likely to be promoted to sergeant than those with no conviction history, a testament to their dedication and motivation.Ben & Jerry’s is incredibly proud of our long relationship with the Greyston Bakery in Yonkers. It was Ben who heard about the bakery and came up with one of our most successful flavors, Chocolate Fudge Brownie, specifically to allow our company to work with and expand the impact of the baker which, through its open hiring process, has helped thousands of returning citizens and their families rebuild their lives and their dignity. It is in part because of our long relationship with the Greyston Bakery that we’ve made changes to our hiring and recruiting process so that people are judged by their skill and qualifications, not the mistakes of the past. There is no doubt, with 1 in 3 Americans having been convicted of a crime, if we were to use criminal conviction as screen for recruiting, we would be leaving very qualified candidates out of our process. That’s just a bad business decision.Across New York, the Cuomo administration has long been dedicated to providing employment for those with criminal convictions. In 2012, we launched the Work for Success Program , which matches qualified and appropriately trained job applicants with criminal convictions to open job listings. In the last five years, we have placed more than 18,000 people in jobs, and each new company that signs on to our Work for Success Pledge also commits to listing job openings with the program.In 2015, the Council on Community Reentry and Reintegration took further steps to ensure equity in hiring by setting uniform guidelines that evaluate qualified applicants for state occupational licenses and adopting “fair chance hiring” for New York State agencies, meaning agencies will not ask about a job applicant’s criminal convictions until and unless the agency has interviewed the candidate and is interested in hiring him or her. As a result of Reentry Council efforts in 2016, New York is also the first in the nation to prohibit insurance companies from denying insurance coverage to businesses that hire people with criminal convictions.These are small steps that can make a huge difference. Together, by signing the Work for Success Pledge , businesses have a real opportunity to not only provide a helping hand to those who have been cut off from opportunities, but to also improve our bottom line. New York State is dedicated to creating a true “state of opportunity” for everyone.FollowFollowingUnfollowAndrew Cuomo	1.0

In just a couple of short months, Americans are going to vote in a critical election. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are vying not only to become president of the United States, but one of them will become the leader of the most potent military force the world has ever seen.I'm standing in a place where I can actually see the site of the World Trade Center. Fifteen years ago this week, the worst terror attack on American soil changed the world and launched this nation into years of war. Tonight's forum is a great opportunity for these nominees to talk about national security and the complex global issues that face our nation. And they'll get to tell you why they are ready for the role of commander-in-chief.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KENNEDY: It shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile launched from Cuba as an attack by the Soviet Union on the United States.JOHNSON: I have today ordered to Vietnam the Air Mobile Division.REAGAN: Air and naval forces of the United States launched a series of strikes against the headquarters and military assets that support Moammar Gadhafi.GEORGE H.W. BUSH: No president can easily commit our sons and daughters to war.BILL CLINTON: We can and will succeed because our mission is clear and our troops are strong.GEORGE W. BUSH: I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.OBAMA: I can report to the American people the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaida.(END VIDEO CLIP)ANNOUNCER: The Commander-in-Chief Forum, live from the Carrier Intrepid in New York. Here now is Matt Lauer.LAUER: Good evening, everyone. The decisions a commander-in- chief makes can have a profound and lasting impact on all Americans, but none more so than the brave men and women who serve, fight, and die for our country. What makes tonight's forum unique, some of the questions will be asked by U.S. military veterans who are in our audience. The presidential nominees will appear back-to-back tonight. After a coin toss yesterday won by Mr. Trump, he chose to go second. So that means we begin tonight with the Democratic nominee for president. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Hillary Clinton.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Matt, how are you? Good to see you. Thank you. Hi. How are you?LAUER: Good to have you.(APPLAUSE)Nice to see you. Good evening.CLINTON: Thank you very much. I'm happy you're doing this.1 of 57Hillary Clinton’s campaign comes to an endView PhotosHillary Clinton loses to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.CaptionHillary Clinton loses to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.Nov. 9, 2016 Hillary Clinton speaks in New York while her husband, former president Bill Clinton, applauds. Melina Mara/The Washington PostBuy PhotoWait 1 second to continue.LAUER: Let me -- thank you very much, I'm happy to be here. Let me ask you something ahead of time that I'll ask Mr. Trump in a half an hour. To the best of your ability tonight, can we talk about your qualities and your qualifications to be commander-in-chief and not use this as an opportunity to attack Mr. Trump, all right? And I'll ask him the exact same thing.CLINTON: I think that's an exactly right way to proceed.LAUER: OK.CLINTON: This is a very important decision for our country. And each of us should be presenting our experience, our expertise, and our plans to protect and defend the United States and our allies around the world.LAUER: What is the most important characteristic that a commander-in-chief can possess?CLINTON: Steadiness. An absolute rock steadiness, and mixed with strength to be able to make the hard decisions. Because I've had the unique experience of watching and working with several presidents. And these are not easy decisions. If they were, they wouldn't get to the president in the first place.And when you're sitting in the Situation Room, as I have on numerous occasions, particularly with respect to determining whether to recommend the raid against bin Laden, what you want in a president, a commander-in-chief, is someone who listens, who evaluates what is being told to him or her, who is able to sort out the very difficult options being presented...LAUER: You're talking about judgment.CLINTON: ... and then makes the decision. Makes the decision, that's right.LAUER: So judgment is a key.CLINTON: Temperament and judgment, yes.LAUER: The word ""judgment"" has been used a lot around you, Secretary Clinton, over the last year-and-a-half, and in particular concerning your use of your personal e-mail and server to communicate while you were secretary of state. You've said it's a mistake.CLINTON: Mm-hmm.LAUER: You said you made not the best choice. You were communicating on highly sensitive topics. Why wasn't it more than a mistake? Why wasn't it disqualifying, if you want to be commander-in- chief?CLINTON: Well, Matt, first of all, as I have said repeatedly, it was a mistake to have a personal account. I would certainly not do it again. I make no excuses for it. It was something that should not have been done.But the real question is the handling of classified material, which is I think what the implication of your question was. And for all the viewers watching you tonight, I have a lot of experience dealing with classified material, starting when I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee going into the four years as secretary of state. Classified material has a header which says ""top secret,"" ""secret,"" ""confidential."" Nothing -- and I will repeat this, and this is verified in the report by the Department of Justice -- none of the e-mails sent or received by me had such a header.LAUER: Were some of the e-mails sent or received by you referring to our drone program, our covert drone program?CLINTON: Yes, because -- of course, there were no discussions of any of the covert actions in process being determined about whether or not to go forward. But every part of our government had to deal with questions, and the secretary of state's office was first and foremost. So there are ways of talking about the drone program...(CROSSTALK)LAUER: And you said you thought your communications on that were fairly routine?CLINTON: Well, let me say, the FBI just released their report about their investigation, they discussed drone matters in the unclassified section of their report.LAUER: But Director Comey also said this after reviewing all the information. He said there is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton's position should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation.CLINTON: Well, Matt, I just respectfully point to the hundreds of experienced foreign policy experts, diplomats, defense officials who were communicating information on the unclassified system because it was necessary to answer questions and to be able publicly to go as far as we could, which was not acknowledging the program.But I would be in Pakistan, as I was on several occasions. There might very well have been a strike. I would be asked in a public setting, in an interview, about it. It was known to have happened. We had to have an answer that did not move into classified area. And I think we handled that appropriately.LAUER: You mentioned you're in Pakistan. Some of the e-mails you sent and received happened while you were overseas. And Director Comey also said that while they have no proof, we assessed that it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton's personal e-mail accounts.CLINTON: Matt, there is no evidence. Of course anything is possible. But what is factual is the State Department system was hacked. Most of the government systems are way behind the curve. We've had hacking repeatedly, even in the White House. There is no evidence my system was hacked.LAUER: Let us bring in Hallie Jackson of NBC News who's been covering this campaign. She's getting questions from our veterans. Hallie, who are you with?JACKSON: Hi, Matt. I'm with Lieutenant Jon Lester (ph), who will stand with me here. He began his military career by enlisting in the Air Force and then switched over to the Navy before he retired, where he flew P-3 Orions in Desert Storm and in Desert Shield. He's a Republican, and he has this question for you, Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Thank you.QUESTION: Secretary Clinton, thank you very much for coming tonight. As a naval flight officer, I held a top secret sensitive compartmentalized information clearance. And that provided me access to materials and information highly sensitive to our warfighting capabilities. Had I communicated this information not following prescribed protocols, I would have been prosecuted and imprisoned.Secretary Clinton, how can you expect those such as myself who were and are entrusted with America's most sensitive information to have any confidence in your leadership as president when you clearly corrupted our national security?CLINTON: Well, I appreciate your concern and also your experience. But let me try to make the distinctions that I think are important for me to answer your question.First, as I said to Matt, you know and I know classified material is designated. It is marked. There is a header so that there is no dispute at all that what is being communicated to or from someone who has that access is marked classified.And what we have here is the use of an unclassified system by hundreds of people in our government to send information that was not marked, there were no headers, there was no statement, top secret, secret, or confidential.I communicated about classified material on a wholly separate system. I took it very seriously. When I traveled, I went into one of those little tents that I'm sure you've seen around the world because we didn't want there to be any potential for someone to have embedded a camera to try to see whatever it is that I was seeing that was designated, marked, and headed as classified.LAUER: Let us...(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: So I did exactly what I should have done and I take it very seriously, always have, always will.LAUER: Sir, thank you. Thank you very much for your question. Secretary Clinton, let's talk about your vote in favor of the war in Iraq. You've since said it was a mistake.CLINTON: Mm-hmm.LAUER: Obviously, it was not something you said you would do again. I asked before for people to raise their hand if you served in Iraq. Can you do it again? How do you think these people feel when the person running to be their commander-in-chief says her vote to go to war in Iraq was a mistake?CLINTON: Look, I think that the decision to go to war in Iraq was a mistake. And I have said that my voting to give President Bush that authority was, from my perspective, my mistake. I also believe that it is imperative that we learn from the mistakes, like after- action reports are supposed to do, and so we must learn what led us down that path so that it never happens again. I think I'm in the best possible position to be able to understand that and prevent it.But I will say this. I'm asking to be judged on the totality of my record, what I've done for our veterans as first lady, as senator, what I've done for Gold Star Families, working with them to increase the death benefit from $12,000 to $100,000, working with Republicans, like Lindsey Graham, to get TRICARE for our National Guard members who didn't have health care unless they were deployed, working to provide more support for the care of our veterans, those who are wounded, working with the Fisher family, now into the third generation of caring for our fallen heroes, working with John McCain to raise money for Brooke Medical Center's Intrepid Center to take care of those who are coming back with profound injuries, working on TBI and PTSD and so much more, working with groups to end veteran suicide, like TAPS. So, yes...LAUER: I'm going to get on to that subject in a second.CLINTON: There was -- there was a mistake. Now, my opponent was for the war in Iraq. He says he wasn't. You can go back and look at the record. He supported it. He told Howard Stern he supported it. So he supported it before it happened, he supported it as it was happening, and he is on record as supporting it after it happened. I have taken responsibility for my decision.LAUER: Let me go to another...CLINTON: He refuses to take responsibility for his support. That is a judgment issue.LAUER: Let me go to another question. Hallie?JACKSON: (OFF-MIKE) who served in the Air Force for nearly a decade, where she was an intelligence specialist, specializing in countering violent extremism. Like you, Secretary Clinton, she's a Democrat and she has this question for you.QUESTION: Thank you. Secretary Clinton, to your point, you have had an extensive record with military intervention. How do you respond to progressives like myself who worry and have concerns that your hawkish foreign policy will continue? And what is your plan to end wasteful war campaigns in which our peers, servicewomen and men, continue to be killed and wounded?CLINTON: Well, I assume you're talking about Iraq, because of my vote, and you probably are talking about Libya, because of the role that I played in the administration's decision about whether to take on Gadhafi.CLINTON: But before I get to that, let me say very clearly: I view force as a last resort, not a first choice. I will do everything in my power to make sure that our men and women in the military are fully prepared for any challenge that they may have to face on our behalf.But I will also be as careful as I can in making the most significant decisions any president and commander-in-chief can make about sending our men and women into harm's way.With respect to Libya, again, there's no difference between my opponent and myself. He's on record extensively supporting intervention in Libya, when Gadhafi was threatening to massacre his population. I put together a coalition that included NATO, included the Arab League, and we were able to save lives. We did not lose a single American in that action.And I think taking that action was the right decision. Not taking it, and permitting there to be an ongoing civil war in Libya, would have been as dangerous and threatening as what we are now seeing in Syria.LAUER: I'm going to jump in. Thank you very much for your question. Let me ask you about the Iran nuclear deal. It was signed under Secretary Kerry; it was begun under you. You started those talks.CLINTON: Right, I did.LAUER: You have said you expect the Iranians to cheat, you think they'll buy time, and perhaps stay along their course to building a nuclear weapon. If they cheat, Secretary Clinton, will you have any course of action other than a military course of action? Would you enter into negotiations with again (ph)? Would you go back to economic sanctions knowing they cheated and are then closer to a nuclear weapon?CLINTON: Matt, look, let me put this in context, because this is one of the most important strategic questions we face. When I became secretary of state, the Iranians were on a fast track to acquiring the material necessary to get a nuclear weapon. That had happened the prior eight years. They mastered the nuclear fuel cycle, they built covert facilities, they stocked them with centrifuges, and they were moving forward.What was our decision? Our decision was to try to put together an international coalition that included Russia and China to exert the kind of pressure through sanctions that the United States alone could not do.LAUER: Right, but you've said that you think they're going to cheat...CLINTON: Now, wait, let me -- look, this is an important issue. I know we're on TV and we don't have a lot of time.LAUER: I want to get to a lot of questions.CLINTON: I will talk quickly. But I want people to understand this. So, yes, I put together the coalition. We imposed the sanctions. We got them to the negotiating table. And after I left, we got the agreement. That agreement put a lid on their nuclear weapons program and imposed intrusive inspections. I have said we are going to enforce it to the letter.LAUER: Do you think they're playing us?CLINTON: On the nuclear issue, no. I think we have enough insight into what they're doing to be able to say we have to distrust but verify. What I am focused on is all the other malicious activities of the Iranians -- ballistic missiles, support for terrorists, being involved in Syria, Yemen, and other places, supporting Hezbollah, Hamas.But here's the difference, Matt. I would rather as president be dealing with Iran on all of those issues without having to worry as much about their racing for a nuclear weapon. So we have made the world safer; we just have to make sure it's enforced.LAUER: Hallie?JACKSON: I'm with Kenneth Anderson (ph). He's one of our undecided voters here. He considers himself an independent. He earned the rank of sergeant in the Marine Corps, where he was an Arabic translator during three tours in Iraq. Kenneth, you have a question for Secretary Clinton.QUESTION: Yes, Secretary Clinton, last October you said that surveys of veterans show that they're overall satisfied with their treatment and that the problems with the V.A. aren't as widespread as they're made out to be. So do you think the problems with the V.A. have been made to seem worse than they really are?CLINTON: Look, I was outraged by the stories that came out about the V.A. And I have been very clear about the necessity for doing whatever is required to move the V.A. into the 21st century, to provide the kind of treatment options that our veterans today desperately need and deserve. And that's what I will do as president.But I will not let the V.A. be privatized. And I do think there is an agenda out there, supported by my opponent, to do just that. I think that would be very disastrous for our military veterans. So I'm going to do everything I can -- I'm going to have a meeting every week in the Oval Office. We're going to bring the V.A. people, we're going to bring the DOD people, because we've got to have a better fit between getting mustered out and getting into the V.A. system, sometimes -- and you probably know this, Sergeant -- I've met so many vets who get mustered out, who leave the service, they can't find their records from DOD, and those records never make it to the V.A. They feel like they're living in a funhouse. They have to go over the same things over and over.We're living in a technological world. You cannot tell me we can't do a better job getting that information. And so I'm going to focus on this. I'm going to work with everybody. I'm going to make them work together.LAUER: And I'm going to jump in.CLINTON: And we're going to fix the problems in the V.A.LAUER: Sergeant, thank you very much for your question. Let's talk about veterans and suicide.CLINTON: Yes, let's, please.LAUER: It's an alarming, alarming story. The population of veterans has a rate of suicide far above the general population.CLINTON: Twenty -- twenty suicides a day.LAUER: What are you going to do to stop it?CLINTON: Well, this month is Suicide Prevention Awareness Month. And I've spent a lot of time with family members, survivors, who've lost a loved one after he or she came home, sometimes suffering from PTSD or TBI or sexual assault, being handed bags of opioids, not being given an appropriate treatment to help that particular person, which is something, to go back to the sergeant's question, we have to change.So I rolled out my mental health agenda last week, and I have a whole section devoted to veterans' mental health. And we've got to remove the stigma. We've got to help people currently serving not to feel that if they report their sense of unease, their depression, that somehow it's going to be a mark against them.We have to do more about addiction, not only drugs, but also alcohol. So I have put forth a really robust agenda, working with a lot of the VSOs and other groups, like TAPS, who have been thinking about this and trying to figure out what we're going to do to help our veterans re-enter civilian life and live full, productive lives.LAUER: Hallie?JACKSON: I'm with Ernie Young. Come on up here with me, a former Army captain, who led troops during tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan. He's an independent voter. And you have a question for the secretary.QUESTION: Secretary Clinton, as an Army veteran, a commander-in- chief's to empathize with servicemembers and their families is important to me. The ability to truly understand implications and consequences of your decisions, actions, or inactions. How will you determine when and where to deploy troops directly into harm's way, especially to combat ISIS?LAUER: As briefly as you can.CLINTON: We have to defeat ISIS. That is my highest counterterrorism goal. And we've got to do it with air power. We've got to do it with much more support for the Arabs and the Kurds who will fight on the ground against ISIS. We have to squeeze them by continuing to support the Iraqi military. They've taken back Ramadi, Fallujah. They've got to hold them. They've got to now get into Mosul.We're going to work to make sure that they have the support -- they have special forces, as you know, they have enablers, they have surveillance, intelligence, reconnaissance help.They are not going to get ground troops. We are not putting ground troops into Iraq ever again. And we're not putting ground troops into Syria. We're going to defeat ISIS without committing American ground troops. So those are the kinds of decisions we have to make on a case-by-case basis.And, remember, when I became secretary of state, we had 200,000 troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. And I'm very grateful that we have brought home the vast majority of those. We have a residual force, as you know, in Afghanistan. We have built up several thousands of the folks that I've talked about who are assisting in the fight against ISIS.But it is in our national security interest to defeat ISIS. And I intend to make that happen.LAUER: Thank you very much for your question.CLINTON: And as part of it, we're going after Baghdadi, the leader, because it will help us focus our attention, just like going after bin Laden helped us focus our attention...LAUER: Secretary...CLINTON: ... in the fight against Al Qaida in the Afghanistan- Pakistan theater.LAUER: Secretary Clinton, I am fast running out of time. I want to get to one of the concerns just about everybody in this country, and that is terror attacks on our soil.CLINTON: Right.LAUER: Either directed by ISIS or inspired by ISIS. Would your message as the next president of the United States or potential next president be to Americans that we simply are living in the reality that those attacks will happen? And can you guarantee people that after four years of a Clinton presidency, they will be safer on the streets of San Bernardino or Boston than they are today?CLINTON: Well, Matt, I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure that that's the result. I'm not going to, you know, promise something that I think most thinking Americans know is going to be a huge challenge, and here's why. We've got to have an intelligence surge. We've got to get a lot more cooperation out of Europe, out of the Middle East. We have to do a better job of not only collecting and analyzing the intelligence we do have, but distributing it much more quickly down the ladder to state and local law enforcement.We also have to do a better job combating ISIS online, where they recruit, where they radicalize. And I don't think we're doing as much as we can. We need to work with Silicon Valley. We need to work with our experts in our government. We have got to disrupt, we have got to take them on in the arena of ideas that, unfortunately, pollute and capture the minds of vulnerable people. So we need to wage this war against ISIS from the air, on the ground, and online, in cyberspace.And here at home, for goodness's sakes, we have to finally pass a law prohibiting people on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in the United States of America. So we've got work to do. I know we can do that work. I'm meeting with a group of terror experts, counterterrorism experts.But I want to just say one additional thing.LAUER: I've got 30 seconds left.CLINTON: Matt Olsen, the former director of the National Center on Counterterrorism, has a great article out today saying the last thing we need to do is to play into the hands of ISIS. Going after American Muslims, defaming a Gold Star family, the family of Captain Khan, making it more difficult for us to have a coalition with Muslim majority nations...LAUER: And we tried to have an agreement...CLINTON: ... that is not going to help us to succeed in defeating ISIS and protecting our American homeland.LAUER: Secretary Hillary Clinton, thank you very much.CLINTON: Thank you. Thank you all.(APPLAUSE)Thank you so much. Too short a time.LAUER: I know. We're going to take a break. We're going to have much more with her competitor, Donald Trump, right after this. You're watching NBC News special, the Commander-in-Chief Forum.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)LAUER: We welcome you back now to this NBC News special, the Commander-in-Chief Forum. Tonight we're speaking with the two major party presidential nominees to find out where they stand on the critical issues. Now, please welcome the Republican nominee for president, Donald Trump.(APPLAUSE)LAUER: Good to see you.TRUMP: Thank you, Matt.LAUER: Thank you very much for joining us.TRUMP: Thank you.LAUER: You heard me say to Mrs. Clinton, Secretary Clinton, and it didn't completely work out toward the end there, as much as possible I'd like you to tell our veterans and our people at home why you are prepared for the role of commander-in-chief and try to keep the attacks to a minimum. We've had a year of that and maybe 60 more days of it.TRUMP: To a minimum, absolutely.LAUER: OK, perfect. To a minimum. I guess that's a question of definition.TRUMP: I guess.LAUER: Any time you interview a president, sitting or past president, they will tell you that the most daunting...TRUMP: Was I supposed to answer this question?LAUER: No, no, no, I mean just keep the attacks to a minimum. Any time you talk to a president, they'll tell you the most daunting part of the job is the role of commander-in-chief.TRUMP: Right. LAUER: What have you experienced in your personal life or your professional life that you believe prepares you to make the decisions that a commander-in-chief has to make?TRUMP: Well, I've built a great company. I've been all over the world. I've dealt with foreign countries. I've done very well, as an example, tremendously well dealing with China and dealing with so many of the countries that are just ripping this country. They are just taking advantage of us like nobody's ever seen before.And I've had great experience dealing on an international basis. I look today and I see Russian planes circling our planes. They're taunting us. I see in Iran, I see the boats taunting our ships, our destroyers, and I think...(CROSSTALK)LAUER: But what have you done in your life that prepares you to send men and women of the United States into harm's way?TRUMP: Well, I think the main thing is I have great judgment. I have good judgment. I know what's going on. I've called so many of the shots. And I happened to hear Hillary Clinton say that I was not against the war in Iraq. I was totally against the war in Iraq. From a -- you can look at Esquire magazine from '04. You can look at before that.And I was against the war in Iraq because I said it's going to totally destabilize the Middle East, which it has. It has absolutely been a disastrous war, and by the way, perhaps almost as bad was the way Barack Obama got out. That was a disaster.LAUER: People talk about you and commander-in-chief, and not just Secretary Clinton, but some of your Republican opponents in the primary season, and they wonder about your temperament. They say, does Donald Trump have the temperament to be commander-in-chief?You said something recently that I found interesting. You admitted that sometimes in the heat of a debate or when you're talking about a lot of issues you say things that you later regret. So can we afford that with a commander-in-chief -- to have a commander-in-chief who says things that he later regrets?TRUMP: Well, when you say regret, yeah, sure, I regret. But in the meantime, I beat 16 people and here I am. So, you know, to a certain extent there is a regret. I would have liked to have done it in a nicer manner. But I had 16 very talented people that I had to go through. And that was a lot of people.LAUER: But when you say...TRUMP: That was a record, Matt. That was a record in the history of Republican politics. I was able to get more votes than anybody ever has gotten in the history of Republican politics.LAUER: But when you say inflammatory things... (CROSSTALK)LAUER: ... in a presidential campaign, it's different than saying them when you're commander-in-chief. If you say things you regret...TRUMP: I agree with you.LAUER: ... when you're commander-in-chief, you can spark a conflict, you can destabilize a region, you can put American lives at risk. Can we afford to take that risk with you?TRUMP: Well, I think absolutely. I think if you saw what happened in Mexico the other day, where I went there, I had great relationships, everything else. I let them know where the United States stands. I mean, we've been badly hurt by Mexico, both on the border and with taking all of our jobs or a big percentage of our jobs.And if you look at what happened, look at the aftermath today where the people that arranged the trip in Mexico have been forced out of government. That's how well we did.LAUER: Back in August...TRUMP: And that's how well we're going to have to do, Matt.LAUER: Back in August, when you admitted that you regret some of the things you said, you also said this. ""I can promise you this: I will always tell you the truth.""TRUMP: It's true.LAUER: So let me read some of the things you've said. ""I know more about ISIS than the generals do. Believe me."" Was that the truth?TRUMP: Well, the generals under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have not been successful. ISIS...LAUER: Do you know more about ISIS than they do?TRUMP: I think under the leadership of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, the generals have been reduced to rubble. They have been reduced to a point where it's embarrassing for our country. You have a force of 30,000 or so people. Nobody really knows. But probably 30,000 people. And I can just see the great -- as an example- General George Patton spinning in his grave as ISIS we can't beat. We had the greatest...(CROSSTALK)LAUER: Yeah, you've said if we had MacArthur today or if we had Patton today, we would not have ISIS, that the rise of these military commanders that we have today, they come up the chain of command, and by the time they get to the top, they're too politically correct. And we know that's not a compliment coming from you. Have you lost faith in the military commanders?TRUMP: I have great faith in the military. I have great faith in certain of the commanders, certainly. But I have no faith in Hillary Clinton or the leadership. You look at what's happened. And, you know, when she comes in and starts saying, oh, I would have done this, I would have -- she's been there for 30 years. I mean, we need change, Matt. We have to have it, and we have to have it fast.LAUER: Let's go to Hallie Jackson in our crowd. Hallie?JACKSON: I'm with Phillip Clay (ph), who was a public affairs officer in the Marine Corps. He spent a year in Anbar province in Iraq. He left the military with the rank of captain, service that inspired him to write a book. He's a Democrat, and he has this question for you, Mr. Trump.QUESTION: Mr. Trump, over the past 15 years, a lot of U.S. troops have bled and died securing towns and provinces from Iraq to Afghanistan, only to have insurgent groups like ISIS spring back the moment we leave. Now, you've claimed to have a secret plan to defeat ISIS. But you're hardly the first politician to promise a quick victory and a speedy homecoming. So assuming we do defeat ISIS, what next? What is your plan for the region to ensure that a group like them doesn't just come back?TRUMP: Sure. I mean, part of the problem that we've had is we go in, we defeat somebody, and then we don't know what we're doing after that. We lose it, like as an example, you look at Iraq, what happened, how badly that was handled. And then when President Obama took over, likewise, it was a disaster. It was actually somewhat stable. I don't think could ever be very stable to where we should have never gone into in the first place.But he came in. He said when we go out -- and he took everybody out. And really, ISIS was formed. This was a terrible decision. And frankly, we never even got a shot. And if you really look at the aftermath of Iraq, Iran is going to be taking over Iraq. They've been doing it. And it's not a pretty picture.The -- and I think you know -- because you've been watching me I think for a long time -- I've always said, shouldn't be there, but if we're going to get out, take the oil. If we would have taken the oil, you wouldn't have ISIS, because ISIS formed with the power and the wealth of that oil.LAUER: How were we going to take the oil? How were we going to do that?TRUMP: Just we would leave a certain group behind and you would take various sections where they have the oil. They have -- people don't know this about Iraq, but they have among the largest oil reserves in the world, in the entire world.And we're the only ones, we go in, we spend $3 trillion, we lose thousands and thousands of lives, and then, Matt, what happens is, we get nothing. You know, it used to be to the victor belong the spoils. Now, there was no victor there, believe me. There was no victor. But I always said: Take the oil.One of the benefits we would have had if we took the oil is ISIS would not have been able to take oil and use that oil...LAUER: Let me stay on ISIS...TRUMP: ... to fuel themselves.LAUER: Let me stay on ISIS. When we've met in the past and we've talked, you say things like I'm going to bomb the expletive out of them very quickly. And when people like me press you for details like that gentleman just said on what your plan is, you very often say, I'm not going to give you the details because I want to be unpredictable.TRUMP: Absolutely. The word is unpredictable.LAUER: But yesterday, you actually told us a little bit about your plan in your speech. You said this. Quote, ""We're going to convene my top generals and they will have 30 days to submit a plan for soundly and quickly defeating ISIS."" So is the plan you've been hiding this whole time asking someone else for their plan?TRUMP: No. But when I do come up with a plan that I like and that perhaps agrees with mine, or maybe doesn't -- I may love what the generals come back with. I will convene...LAUER: But you have your own plan?TRUMP: I have a plan. But I want to be -- I don't want to -- look. I have a very substantial chance of winning. Make America great again. We're going to make America great again. I have a substantial chance of winning. If I win, I don't want to broadcast to the enemy exactly what my plan is.LAUER: But you're going to...TRUMP: And let me tell you, if I like maybe a combination of my plan and the generals' plan, or the generals' plan, if I like their plan, Matt, I'm not going to call you up and say, ""Matt, we have a great plan."" This is what Obama does. ""We're going to leave Iraq on a certain day.""LAUER: But you're going to convene a panel of generals, and you've already said you know more about ISIS than those generals do.TRUMP: Well, they'll probably be different generals, to be honest with you. I mean, I'm looking at the generals, today, you probably saw, I have a piece of paper here, I could show it, 88 generals and admirals endorsed me today.(CROSSTALK)LAUER: It's a numbers game. Hillary Clinton claims more numbers.TRUMP: Well, it's not really -- it's not -- yeah, numbers. People that have been losing for us for a long period of time. I mean, the fact is, we have had the worst and you could even say the dumbest foreign policy. Our results are so bad. We would have been better off had we never, ever spent $2 in that part of the world.LAUER: You recently -- you recently received two intelligence briefings.TRUMP: Yes, I did.LAUER: Did anything in that briefing, without going into specifics, shock or alarm you?TRUMP: Yes. Very much so.LAUER: Did you learn new things in that briefing?TRUMP: First of all, I have great respect for the people that gave us the briefings. We -- they were terrific people. They were experts on Iraq and Iran and different parts of -- and Russia. But, yes, there was one thing that shocked me. And it just seems to me that what they said President Obama and Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, who is another total disaster, did exactly the opposite.LAUER: Did you learn anything in that briefing -- again, not going into specifics -- that makes you reconsider some of the things you say you can accomplish, like defeating ISIS quickly?TRUMP: No, I didn't learn anything from that standpoint. What I did learn is that our leadership, Barack Obama, did not follow what our experts and our truly -- when they call it intelligence, it's there for a reason -- what our experts said to do. LAUER: Hallie?TRUMP: And I was very, very surprised. In almost every instance. And I could tell you. I have pretty good with the body language. I could tell they were not happy. Our leaders did not follow what they were recommending.LAUER: Hallie?JACKSON: I'm with former Army Captain Sue Fulton, who was a member of the First West Point class to include women. She served as a signal corps officer in Germany.(APPLAUSE)She's a Democrat, and she has this question for you, Mr. Trump.QUESTION: Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Hi, thank you very much.QUESTION: Thank you. Do you believe that an undocumented person who serves -- who wants to serve in the U.S. armed forces deserves to stay in this country legally?TRUMP: I think that when you serve in the armed forces, that's a very special situation, and I could see myself working that out, absolutely.LAUER: So she's saying has already served in the armed forces or wants to serve, plans to serve?QUESTION: Plans to serve. Plans to serve in the armed forces. As you know, under DACA, we already have people who are undocumented who are serving.TRUMP: I think military is a very special thing. If they plan on serving, if they get in, I would absolutely hold those people -- now, we have to be very careful. We have to vet very carefully. Everybody would agree with that. But the answer is, it would be a very special circumstance, yes. Thank you.LAUER: Thank you very much for your question. Hallie, you have another one?JACKSON: I do. Alex Gronkowski (ph) was an Army staff sergeant assigned in special operations. He was stationed at Fort Bragg and was deployed to Afghanistan and other places across the Middle East. He has not decided who he will vote for yet in November. And you have a question for Mr. Trump.QUESTION: I do. Mr. Trump, as you know, tensions between the United States and Russia have been at the highest level since the Cold War. In your first 120 days of presidency, how would you de-escalate the tensions? And more importantly, what steps would you take to bring Mr. Putin and the Russian government back to negotiating table? TRUMP: I think I would have a very good relationship with many foreign leaders. I think it's very sad, when you look at Barack Obama, as an example, lands Air Force One in China, and they don't want to put out stairs to get off the plane. And he has to use the stairs that mechanics use to get up and down to fix the plane. They wouldn't give him stairs.I think it's very sad, when he lands in Saudi Arabia, and he lands in Cuba, and there aren't high officials to even greet him. This is the first time in the history -- the storied history of Air Force One.I think I would have a very, very good relationship with Putin. And I think I would have a very, very good relationship with Russia.As I said, take a look today. Take a look at what happened with their fighter jets circling one of our aircraft in a very dangerous manner. Somebody said less than 10 feet away. This is hostility.And I saw, just two or three days ago, they looked like they were not exactly getting along, but I looked at President Obama and Putin staring at each other. These were not two people that were getting along.And, you know, the beautiful part of getting along, Russia wants to defeat ISIS as badly as we do. If we had a relationship with Russia, wouldn't it be wonderful if we could work on it together and knock the hell out of ISIS? Wouldn't that be a wonderful thing?LAUER: Let me ask you about some of the things you've said about Vladimir Putin. You said, I will tell you, in terms of leadership, he's getting an A, our president is not doing so well. And when referring to a comment that Putin made about you, I think he called you a brilliant leader, you said it's always a great honor to be so nicely complimented by a man so highly respected within his country and beyond.TRUMP: Well, he does have an 82 percent approval rating, according to the different pollsters, who, by the way, some of them are based right here. Look, look...LAUER: He's also a guy who annexed Crimea, invaded Ukraine, supports Assad in Syria, supports Iran, is trying to undermine our influence in key regions of the world, and according to our intelligence community, probably is the main suspect for the hacking of the DNC computers...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Well, nobody knows that for a fact. But do you want me to start naming some of the things that President Obama does at the same time?LAUER: But do you want to be complimented by that former KGB officer? TRUMP: Well, I think when he calls me brilliant, I'll take the compliment, OK? The fact is, look, it's not going to get him anywhere. I'm a negotiator. We're going to take back our country. You look at what's happening to our country, you look at the depleted military. You look at the fact that we've lost our jobs. We're losing our jobs like we're a bunch of babies. We're going to take back our country, Matt. The fact that he calls me brilliant or whatever he calls me is going to have zero impact.LAUER: But the fact that you say you can get along with him, do you think the day...TRUMP: I think I'd be able to get along with him.LAUER: Do you think the day that you become president of the United States, he's going to change his mind on some of these key issues?TRUMP: Possibly. It's possible. I don't know, Matt. It's possible. And it's not going to have any impact. If he says great things about me, I'm going to say great things about him. I've already said, he is really very much of a leader. I mean, you can say, oh, isn't that a terrible thing -- the man has very strong control over a country.Now, it's a very different system, and I don't happen to like the system. But certainly, in that system, he's been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader. We have a divided country. We have a country where you have Hillary Clinton with her e-mails that nobody's ever seen where she deletes 33,000 e-mails, and that's after getting a subpoena from Congress. If you do that in private business, you get thrown in jail.LAUER: Hallie?JACKSON: Steve Korea (ph), here with me, was in the Army Reserves and spent 10 months in Iraq right at the beginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He is a Republican and has this question for you.QUESTION: Good evening, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Hi.QUESTION: I like what you say about supporting veterans and how they're important. But I haven't heard what the actual plans are to continue that support beyond words. How do you translate those words to action after you take office?TRUMP: Well, I love that question, because I've been very close to the vets. You see the relationship I have with the vets just by looking at the polls. In fact, today a poll came out. And my relationship has been very good.I have a very, very powerful plan that's on my website that you possibly saw. One of the big problems is the wait time. Vets are waiting six days, seven days, eight days. And by the way, Hillary Clinton six months ago said the vets are being treated essentially just fine, there's no real problem, it's over-exaggerated. She did say that.LAUER: No, no, she went on after that and laid out a litany of problems within the V.A.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Look, I mean, she made up half of the things she said about me. I'm telling you, this is -- she said she was satisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administration.Now, under my plan, if you've got to wait -- and, by the way, people are dying on line. They're dying, waiting, waiting to get to see a doctor. They're waiting five days and six days.Under a part of my plan, if they have that long wait, they walk outside, they go to the local doctor, they choose the doctor, they choose the hospital, whether it's public or private, they get themselves better. In many cases, it's a minor procedure or a pill or just a prescription. And they end up dying because they can't get to see the doctor. We will pay the bill. They go outside, they get a doctor, they get a prescription, they do what they have to do, and we pay the bill.That is something that I have been praised -- and, by the way, I never said take the V.A. -- take the Veterans Administration private. I wouldn't do that. Too much respect for our people. I would never do that.LAUER: OK.TRUMP: I heard it was said that I said that. I would not do that. But I do believe -- I do believe, when you're waiting in line for six, seven days, you should never be in a position like that. You go out, you see the doctor, you get yourself taken care of.LAUER: Hallie, you've got another question.JACKSON: I do. Rachel Fredericks (ph), who specialized in aviations operations in the Marine Corps, serving stateside, she lost two friends to suicide. And you now struggle yourself with PTSD. She's a Republican, but leaning towards you, still undecided a little bit. Rachel, you have a question for Mr. Trump.QUESTION: I do. Mr. Trump, I wanted to ask what your plan will be to stop 20 veterans a day from killing themselves.TRUMP: And actually it's 22. And it's almost impossible to conceive that this is happening in our country, 20 to 22 people a day are killing themselves. A lot of it is they're killing themselves over the fact that they can't -- they're under tremendous pain and they can't see a doctor.We're going to speed up the process. We're going to create a great mental health division. They need help. They need help. They need tremendous help. And we're doing nothing for them.The V.A. is really almost, you could say, a corrupt enterprise. If you look at what's going on, as an example, Matt, in Arizona, where they caught people stealing, and they can't even do anything about it, they can't even fire the people. So we are going to make it efficient and good. And if it's not good, you're going out to private hospitals, public hospitals, and doctors. Thank you very much.LAUER: Hallie, one more?JACKSON: Donald Day (ph) here, who served as a radio operator in the Marine Corps in the Vietnam era. He had tours of duty in Southeast Asia and in Europe. He's also a Democrat and has this question for you.QUESTION: Mr. Trump, I have a daughter who is interested in joining the service, but when she researched the military, she saw the stats on sexual assault and decided not to go. I have a concern about the rape of women in our armed forces. As president, what specifically would you do to support all victims of sexual assault in the military?TRUMP: It's a great question. And it's a massive problem. The numbers are staggering, hard to believe, even. But we're going to have to run it very tight. I at the same time want to keep the court system within the military. I don't think it should be outside of the military. But we have to come down very, very hard on that.And your daughter is absolutely right, it is a massive problem. But we have to do something about that problem. And the best thing we can do is set up a court system within the military. Right now, the court system practically doesn't exist. It takes too long.LAUER: In 2013, on this subject, you tweeted this, quote, ""26,000 unreported sexual assaults in the military, only 238 convictions. What did these geniuses expect when they put men and women together?""TRUMP: Well, it is -- it is -- it is a correct tweet. There are many people that think that that's absolutely correct. And we need to have a...(CROSSTALK)LAUER: So this should have been expected? And does that mean the only way to fix it is to take women out of the military?TRUMP: Well, it's happening, right? And, by the way, since then, it's gotten worse. No, not to take them out, but something has to be happen. Right now, part of the problem is nobody gets prosecuted. You have reported and -- the gentleman can tell you, you have the report of rape and nobody gets prosecuted. There are no consequence.When you have somebody that does something so evil, so bad as that, there has to be consequence for that person. You have to go after that person. Right now, nobody's doing anything. Look at the small number of results. I mean, that's part of the problem.LAUER: So many of the issues that we've talked about with you, Mr. Trump, tonight, and Secretary Clinton, are so complex that even career military people and career diplomats and politicians have trouble getting their arms around them.TRUMP: Right.LAUER: You've had a very different background, in business. So nobody would expect you to have taken over the last 20 years really deep dives into some of these issues. But I'm curious about what you're doing now. What kind of research are you doing now? What kind of homework are you doing? What kind of things are you reading as you prepare for the day in two months where you might be elected the next president of the United States?TRUMP: Sure. Well, in the front row, you have four generals. You have admirals. We have people all throughout the audience that I'm dealing with. Right here is a list that was just printed today of 88 admirals and generals that I meet with and I talk to.LAUER: How much time are you spending on this?TRUMP: I'm also -- a lot. A lot. And I'm doing a lot of different things. Don't forget, we're running a big campaign. We're doing very well. I'm also, you know, and I'm very much giving it to my children and my executives to run, I'm also partially running a business. I'm campaigning, I'm running a business. I've got a lot of hats right now.But we're doing very well. But in the meantime, I am studying. And I'm meeting constantly -- you see -- you see General Flynn and you see some of the folks that we have, and they're scattered throughout the audience. So we have admirals, we have generals, we have colonels. We have a lot of people that I respect.And I think I've learned a lot. But I think, also, I certainly -- I really feel I have a common sense on the various issues that you're talking about, Matt.LAUER: You said in the speech today, you said history shows that when America is not prepared is when the danger is the greatest.TRUMP: And we're not prepared.LAUER: Will you be prepared on day one, if you're elected president of the United States, to tackle these complex national security issues?TRUMP: One hundred percent. Hey, Matt, again, she made a mistake on Libya. She made a terrible mistake on Libya. And the next thing, I mean, not only did she make the mistake, but then they complicated the mistake by having no management once they bombed you know what out of Gadhafi. I mean, she made a terrible mistake on Libya. And part of it was the management aftereffect. I think that we have great management talents, great management skills. LAUER: But you are prepared?TRUMP: And I have to tell you -- totally prepared. But remember this. I found this subject and these subjects of interest all of my life, Matt. This hasn't been over the last 14 months. I've found these substantiates of tremendous interest. That's why they were asking me about Iraq 14 years ago. They were asking me these questions. They don't ask businesspeople those questions.LAUER: Let me end in kind of the same place I started. Have you given much thought, Mr. Trump, if you're elected president and commander-in-chief, to that moment where you're going to have to make that first decision that puts American men and women in harm's way?TRUMP: I think it's the most difficult decision you can possibly ever make. You're talking about death. And we're talking death to not just our side. We're talking death all over. I would be very, very cautious. I think I'd be a lot slower. She has a happy trigger. You look, she votes for the wars, she goes in Libya...(CROSSTALK)LAUER: Have you thought about personally the emotional burden of that moment?TRUMP: I think it's a tremendous burden. I think there is no greater burden that anybody could have. I've been preparing this for a long time. And, you know, my theme is make America great again. We're going to make America great again. But, Matt, we've also got to make America strong again. And right now, we are not strong. Believe me. We have a depleted military. We have the greatest people in the world in our military. But it is very sadly depleted.LAUER: The Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald Trump.TRUMP: Thank you, Matt.LAUER: Thank you.(APPLAUSE)We're going to be much -- we'll be back with much more from the Intrepid carrier on this Commander-in-Chief Forum right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)LAUER: There's a lot of people we want to thank for making tonight a success, the presidential nominees themselves, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. We want to thank the many veterans in our audience for their questions and, most importantly, for their service. We want to thank our hosts at the IAVA, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, and, of course, the Intrepid Sea, Air, and Space Museum, this amazing venue.The first presidential debate will be held on September 26th right here on NBC. It'll be hosted by my colleague, Lester Holt. We hope you'll tune in for that. And more importantly, we hope you get out and vote this November. Nothing could be more important.Thank you for joining us tonight. For Matt Lauer -- I'm Matt Lauer. For all of us at NBC News, we appreciate your tuning in.1 of 60"	1.0

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/22/barack-obama/updated-eight-houses-for-john-and-cindy-mccain/	John McCain has seven houses.	mtrue	['Candidate Biography']	http://www.nytimes.com/	http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/11/us/politics/11web-nagourney.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&oref=slogin	2008/08/22	But it is a theme that his aides believe proved to be successful, and they are planning to use it aggressively ahead through the Republican convention and into the fall. ( Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, whose appearance in the first celebrity ad drew ridicule from Democrats and Ms. Hilton, will be retired from future spots — after helping draw huge attention in the form of news coverage and nearly 2 million You Tube hits). “The American people are likely not going to want to elect someone to the presidency based on their ability to transform themselves into a celebrity,” said Steve Schmidt, a senior adviser to Mr. McCain. “The advertising is effective because it speaks to a truth that people instantly get. This was inspired by what Mr. McCain’s advisers — and some Democrats - suspect was one mistake Mr. Obama made on his otherwise well-received overseas trip: appearing at a rally before 200,000 Germans in Berlin, an event that lead Mr. McCain’s advisers to describe Mr. Obama as presumptuous and provided the footage for the first so-called celebrity ads (expect to more of that in future ads, highlighted by Mr. Obama presenting himself as a “fellow citizen of the world). If this kind of attack does strike a chord, then Mr. Obama might find he gave Republicans a bit of a gift with his decision to deliver his convention acceptance speech before 76,000 people at a stadium in Denver, an appearance (think tail-gate parties) that seems to have potential to underline the Republican message. Implicit in this approach is an attempt to portray Mr. Obama as different, or alien, from many Americans, reinforcing a reluctance that polls suggest many Americans have about voting for this newcomer. Hence the references to his years at Harvard, his years in Chicago’s Hyde Park, his affection for frequent gym visits and the food he eats, or to the McCain camp’s use of words intended to make Mr. Obama seem elite or effete.

Will all this work? Mr. Obama’s advisers argue that public polling data shows no evidence that it is taking hold, and that the public has little tolerance for this kind of attack at a time when there are so many serious issues facing the nation. “Their intent is obvious, but I don’t see any evidence that they are gaining with this,” said David Axelrod, Mr. Obama’s senior strategist. He said he did not believe that Mr. McCain, of all candidates, could succeed in painting Mr. Obama as elitist. “Obviously, his strategists met on the portico of the McCain estate in Sedona — or maybe in one of his six other houses — and decided what line of attack they were going to use,” he said. While Mr. McCain has used this summer to figure out a way to go after Mr. Obama, Mr. Obama used it to patch up a hole in his resume with his overseas trip. It produced images of Mr. Obama meeting with foreign leaders and visiting troops that even Republicans say would go a long way to addressing voter concerns about his foreign policy credentials. And they permitted Mr. Obama to dominate political coverage for much of July. In downplaying the effectiveness of the Republican attacks on Mr. Obama, Mr. Axelrod was echoing the way Mr. Schmidt and other McCain advisers downplayed the effect of Mr. Obama’s trip. In both cases, the campaigns pointed to polls as evidence that voters weren’t impressed. . But now may not be the time to judge the effectiveness of these tactics; things campaigns do in the summer often are not done with an eye to the daily Gallup tracking poll, but rather for setting the table for the fall. “Some people are paying attention,” said Charlie Black, a senior adviser to Mr. McCain. “But you are laying the foundation for the debate for the fall. Even if people don’t pay enough attention to say, ‘I’m changing my vote’ or ‘I’m making up my mind,’ they do absorb the information. The fact that Mr. McCain’s campaign continues to push this line of attack it trotted out this summer suggests that his camp thinks it works. And Mr. Obama’s campaign, which has seemed both awfully confident and at times hesitant in responding to Mr. McCain, may have learned a lesson that it can put to use this fall. “We need to make sure that he is paying a price for his negativity,” said David Plouffe, Mr. Obama’s campaign manager. “The lesson here is that the media is definitely going to cover the theater of the absurd. And we have to be very mindful of that. George Bush didn’t have to worry so much about that, but John McCain is viewed by some independent voters as a different kind of politician.	1.0

The United States ordered the EU to impose sanctions and frankly we have overestimated the independence of the European Union [from the US].”“Sanctions are a sign of irritation, they are not the instrument of serious policies,” he added.Lavrov also hit out at the US Congress, which on Saturday unanimously approved the Ukraine Freedom Support Act in both houses, which includes fresh sanctions against Moscow.When asked if he believed the US was trying to impose regime change in Moscow by undermining the Russian economy, Lavrov said he had “very serious reasons to believe this is the case”.“If you look at US Congress, 80 percent of them have never left the USA, so I’m not surprised about Russophobia in Congress,” he said.Lavrov insisted Russia was determined to find a solution for the Ukrainian crisis and that Russia “supports the territorial integrity of Ukraine”.But when asked if this included Crimea, which split from Ukraine in March 2014, Lavrov said: “Crimea is unique, it is the one and only, it is Russian land. It was the will of the [Crimean people].”Lavrov also discussed Russian policy towards NATO, which has “cut practically all ties with Russia” while moving “close to the Russian border” but still wanted Russian help training Afghan pilots.“It’s childish – but what to do?” he said. “Sometimes the big boys play games.”On the subject of France’s decision to suspend the delivery of two Mistral-class warships to Russia over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Lavrov said he would not comment on a deal that “is about a signed legal contract and the dignity of the French nation”.	1.0

For example, focusing on the Texas-only data actually obscures rather than illuminates if you are trying to help Texans gauge the risk. Two of the big dangers to us are sea level rise and Gulf hurricanes. Those risks are going to be driven by polar region warming (ice melt) and ocean surface temperatures (thermal expansion of ocean water and hurricane-fueling hot ocean surfaces) vs. average land temps in Texas. Flooding in Central Texas would also be affected by ocean temps and the regional weather dynamics they set up. In short: the fact that we may not set a record in a given year here in Texas won't protect us from the impacts of a record-setting year globally, so the global temps should get our attention.	1.0

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. KARL: Let's make a deal. SEN. ROBERT MENENDEZ, R-N.J.: All of the major issues have largely been agreed to. KARL: Congress is finally moving forward on immigration. Plus... SEN. PATRICK J. TOOMEY, R-PA.: I don't consider criminal background checks to be gun control. KARL: A bipartisan breakthrough on guns. But will either deal survive? We've got key players on all sides. Republicans Marco Rubio, and Jeff Sessions, and Democrat Chuck Schumer. Then our powerhouse roundtable on all the week's politics. The president jumps into the budget battle. OBAMA: I've already met Republicans more than halfway. BOEHNER: Listen, why don't we do what we can agree to do? KARL: And, Jay-Z's rap on his Cuba flap. Plus, we celebrate Jackie Robinson's legacy with baseball legend, Mariano Rivera, only on this week. ANNOUNCER: From ABC News, This Week with George Stephanopoulos. Reporting from the Museum in Washington is Chief White House Correspondent, Jonathan Karl. KARL: Hello again. George is off, and it's great to have you with us. The last session of Congress was the least productive in history, but there are signs that may be about to change. There is a lot of talk about bipartisan compromise this week, including indications that the long awaited immigration bill is about to be revealed. So, what's in the plan? We're joined by the Republican Party's point man on immigration, Florida Senator Marco Rubio. Senator Rubio, thank you for joining us. RUBIO: Thank you, Jonathan. KARL: So you are considered the key to getting immigration reform passed. My question this morning is, do we have a deal? RUBIO: Well, first of all, let me say, I am not the key. I think there's 92 other senators and eight (ph) that I've worked, so (ph) many (ph) others that I've worked with that are key to this as well. So I am just here today to communicate to you the importance of this issue, and hopefully what we've agreed to. Let me say this about - you asked me if there was an agreement. The answer is, we've been working very hard, and I think we have come to a position now where we've been able to tell our staffs to draft something. We need to read that, and that's what we're in the process of doing. But I am very optimistic that we're going to have something very positive to share with the American people here very, very soon, perhaps as early as this week. KARL: But to be clear, you're talking about something that will give a path to citizenship for those that are in the country illegally right now, and in fact, give them legal status six months after this becomes law. RUBIO: Well, first of all, I think it's important to understand it does not give anything. It allows people access to the legal immigration system. Number two, some people won't qualify. They haven't been here long enough; they've committed very serious crimes. They won't be able to stay. Number three is all people will get an opportunity to apply for things, to apply for a legal status, which isn't awarded on day one. I mean, there is a process for that. You have to pay an application fee and a fine, and you are going to have to stay in that status while you pay taxes and prove that you are not a public charge. And you don't qualify for any federal benefits. And after some period of time, over 10 years that's elapsed, the only thing you will get - assuming that the border is secure, that e-verify is in place, that an entry exit system is in place for tracking visas, then the only thing you get is the chance to apply for a green card, like everybody else does. The only thing you are earning here is an opportunity to apply for temporary status, and ultimately potentially to apply for a green card, the way everybody else does. And that's the process that we are outlining. KARL: But you are already taking heat from some of your own natural allies on the right. Congressman King, Steve King in the House is calling this amnesty. He said this week that what you're talking would, quote, ""pardon immigration lawbreakers and reward them with the object of their crime."" And Senator Ted Cruz, Republican in the Senate, was just as harsh. Listen to what he had to say. SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS: If we pass something that allows those here illegally to achieve citizenship, it means you're a chump for having stayed in your own country and followed the rules. KARL: So? Your response? RUBIO: Well, first of all, the existing law allows people that are here illegally to gain access to citizenship. What it says is you have to go back to your country of birth and you have to wait 10 years, and then you can apply for it. All we've done here is create an alternative to that that they can access, and the alternative we've created is going to be longer, more expensive and more difficult to navigate. It will actually be cheaper if they went back home, waited 10 years, and applied for a green card. And so, secondly, we've not awarding anything. All we're giving people the opportunity to eventually do is gain access to the same legal immigration system, the same legal immigration process that will be available to everybody else. And number three, in exchange for all of that, we are going to get the toughest enforcement measures in the history of this country. We're going to secure the border to the extent that's possible. We're going to have an entry and exit system to track visas, because 40 percent of our illegal immigrants are people that entered legally and overstayed, and we are going to have e-verify, universally, which means that you will not be able to find a job in the United States if you're not legally here. KARL: Now, one of your toughest Republican critics on this, Senator Sessions, is listening to this interview right now. And he asked the question, is this bill enforcement first or is it legalization first? And the bottom line is, with legalization being in just six months, the answer is, this is legalization first, isn't it? RUBIO: Well, first - yeah, but it's, well, but it's important to understand that. If you do just – that was my original position. The problem is what do we do in the meantime? While you're doing all these enforcement mechanisms, what do you do with the millions of people that are undocumented? Is it a big game of cat and mouse, where if we catch you, you have to leave, but if we don't catch you, in the future you get to apply? I want to know who's here now, and I want to freeze the problem in place so it does not get worse. That's the first thing. The second thing is we don't want a rush on the border. We don't want people to think, well, they are still doing this enforcement stuff, but at some point in a few years, they're going to actually start some process, so let me sneak in now to take advantage of it. We don't want that either. What I want is to freeze the problem that's in place. Look, I'm not happy about the fact that we have millions of people here illegally, and quite frankly, those decisions that led to that happening were made when I was in ninth grade. But that's what we have. This is not a theory, it is the reality, and what we have today is we don't do anything about it. It's de facto amnesty. What I'm saying is, let's bring these people out so we can figure out who needs to leave and who we're going to give a chance to earn their way towards one day being able to apply for a green card, the same way everybody else does. And I think that's why that is a better approach. KARL: All right, let's talk for a second about the politics here. What is at stake for the Republican party here? What will it do to your party if the conservatives who oppose this succeed in killing it? RUBIO: Well, first of all, look, I think that I am looking to the other 92 senators weighing in, because I think they're going to make it better. There are eight of us that have worked on this, and we've worked very hard, but there are 92 other people with their own ideas, and I have tried to incorporate as many of their ideas as possible, given the bills that they have filed in the past. Some of them have submitted letters that outlined concerns, and we have answers for all of those concerns. But I look forward to how they can improve this bill and this product. As far as the Republican Party is concerned, I just want the Republican Party to be what it's always been. I want the conservative movement to be what it's always been about, and that is solving problems in a way that's true to our values and the principles of the greatest nation on earth. And immigration is a problem. Even if we didn't have a single illegal immigrant in the United States, we'd have to do immigration reforms, because our legal immigration system is broken. Immigration is a problem because our laws are not enforced. They are not enforced. We have no way to track people that are overstaying their visas. We have no way to keep people from taking jobs away from Americans, and we have not secured our border, leading not just to our immigration problem, but to a national security sovereignty and humanitarian problem on the border. And this bill hopefully achieves progress on all three of those fronts, and I just hope that I can convince people that leaving things the way they are now is much worse than approaching it the way we've outlined. KARL: OK, I want to move to the other big bipartisan compromise that emerged last week or this week, which is the deal on guns. Now, when you were in the Florida state legislature, you supported background checks, and back in 2007, you said that - let me see if I can get the - ""if someone is a dangerous person who has shown a proclivity for using firearms to hurt other people, then we don't want them having a permit, much less ownership of a firearms. So my question to you is I assume you still believe that. You don't want dangerous people with a proclivity to commit crimes. RUBIO: Everybody believes that. KARL: So why not have background checks to buy a gun? What's wrong with having background checks at gun shows? RUBIO: First of all, we do have background checks. RUBIO: -- de facto background check. KARL: But Senator, we don't have background checks for all sales at gun shows. We don't have background checks for all sales online. What the Manchin-Toomey compromise would do would say all of those sales, too, have background checks. What's wrong with that? RUBIO: Well, first of all, do you want the background check, because the background check system right now does not work because it's not being enforced. Number two is, criminals don't care about the laws that we pass with regards to guns. They never follow the law. That's why they are criminals. Look, here is the bottom line. I think everyone is in favor of any law that could effectively keep criminals or dangerous people from getting access to guns. The problem is that all these laws that people are discussing will not effectively deal with that problem, but will infringe on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens. And so, what we need to look for is a compromise that actually accomplishes that, that does not infringe or place additional burdens on law-abiding citizens, and in fact is effective at keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous people, and that begins by enforcing it. Are we going to start prosecuting people that are trying to buy guns and fail a background check? Because they are not prosecuting those right now. Are we going to honor conceal-carry permits from across state lines? Because someone who has a conceal-carry permit has been background checked. That's why they have one. Are we going to honor those in a gun show in other parts of the country? I think that should be part of the bill. And here is my bigger point. This debate about guns, we are missing a golden opportunity to have the real debate we should be having, and that is a debate about violence. Guns are what they're using to commit the violence, but the problem is violence, and no one is focusing on why this society has become so violent, why young people in America are committing these horrifying acts, and we are missing a golden opportunity to discuss that, and not simply just focus on gun laws that only law-abiding people will follow. KARL: Senator, we're almost out of time, but I've got to ask you about the Cuban vacation for Jay-Z and Beyonce, going down to Cuba on a cultural visa from the Treasury Department. You obviously said you thought that was a mistake to allow them to go down there. Jay-Z was pretty harsh. You know what Jay-Z is saying, let's be clear, was pretty harsh about critics like you, saying what's wrong, he's not a criminal for simply going down to Cuba. So what's your message back to Jay-Z? You can rap it if you want. He rapped his message to you. RUBIO: Well, I won't rap it, but I'll say, I mean, first of all, I think Jay-Z needs to get informed. One of his heroes is Che Guevara. Che Guevara was a racist. Che Guevara was a racist that wrote extensively about the superiority of white Europeans over people of African descent, so he should inform himself on the guy that he's propping up. Secondly, I think if Jay-Z was truly interested in the true state of affairs in Cuba, he would have met people that are being oppressed, including a hip-hop artist in Cuba who is right now being oppressed and persecuted and is undergoing a hunger strike because of his political lyrics. And I think he missed an opportunity. But that's Jay-Z's issue. The bigger point is the travel policies. The travel policies need to be tightened because they are being abused. These are tourist trips, and they are – what they're doing is providing hard currency and funding so that a tyrannical regime can maintain its grip on the island of Cuba, and I think that's wrong. KARL: All right, Senator Rubio, thank you for joining us on ""This Week."" KARL: And we're joined now by another member of the gang of eight, New York Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer and Alabama Republican Senator Jeff Sessions. Senator Sessions, you heard Senator Rubio's pitch to conservatives like you, in fact you specifically. Are you convinced? SESSIONS: No, I'm not convinced. I know Senator Rubio's heart is exactly right. And I really respect the work of the gang of eight. But they have produced legislation, it appears -- although it looks like now it may be another week before we see it, that will give amnesty now, legalize everyone that's here effectively today and then there's a promise of enforcement in the future. Even if you pass laws today that appear to be effective, it doesn't mean they're going to be enforced. And we have in this administration, a failure to enforce. So that's a big deal right now. KARL: But doesn't Senator Rubio have a point that those that are here now effectively have amnesty? I mean, nobody is prosecuting the 11 million undocumented immigrants that are in the country right now. SESSIONS: You're exactly right. We have got a real problem with that situation. And what we need to do is to analyze how to handle it, how to make sure that we do the right thing for America. I think it's incumbent on Republicans, Democrats, and every one of us to ask what is going to happen to working Americans whose wages have been falling since 2000 who are unemployed at a very high rate. It will impact them adversely. We have to ask how the new flow of workers is going to be maybe double the current flow of legal workers in the future, in addition to those who will be legalized, 11 million. How that will impact them. So, I think the public interest is to figure out how we can deal with the crisis we face, how we can have a lawful system that serves the national interest without hammering, as the civil rights commission members have said, the average low-income worker, the African-American and Hispanic worker that's here. KARL: So, Senator Schumer, is this amnesty first? SCHUMER: No, not at all. This is a very balanced bill. The American people have told us to do two things. One, prevent future flows of illegal immigration and then, come up with a common sense solution for legal immigration. And that's what our bill does. You know, we've worked long and hard on this so, we're very, very close. Every major -- every significant disagreement among the eight of us is resolved. And I expect we will -- the eight of us will introduce a bill on Tuesday. Obviously, there have been problems. But last Friday night, this past Friday night, under Dianne Feinstein's leadership, the last problem, agriculture, was agreed to. The growers and the farm workers are there. So of course, we've all said, until the eight of us sign that bill, put our names on it, Tuesday, we don't have final agreement. But I see nothing in the way. And I think you'll see a major agreement that's balanced but fair, that will have the widespread support of the American people on Tuesday. KARL: But you know, Senator Schumer, I've talked to some of those who have been advocating this for a long time who say the Republican Party has their back against the wall on this, with Hispanic voters, that Democrats are driving this and that you guys are giving up too much. I mean, under this compromise, as I understand it, somebody would have to wait ten years before even getting a green card, 13 years before, at the very earliest, they could be eligible for citizenship. Even somebody who has been in the country for 20 years. Have you given up too much on this? SCHUMER: Well, I'm not going to get into specifics. But the eight of us have met in the middle. And I think that's where the American people are. They want a solution to immigration, as Marco Rubio said, and he's been a tremendous asset here. As Marco Rubio has said, the present situation is untenable. This is a balanced approach that both prevents future waves of illegal immigration, but has common sense solutions. Look at what we do now. We turn away people who could actually create jobs in America. And at the same time, we let people come across our border who take jobs away from Americans. Who wouldn't want to fix that in a fair and balanced way? And that's what we're doing. KARL: So, let me ask you, Senator Sessions, you have said there are just too many unanswered questions about what this does. You put out a bunch of them. You have got one of the principal architects of this compromise right here. Fire away. What's your question? SESSIONS: Well, I would ask Senator Schumer this, if this legislation is established by reputable economists as pulling down the wages of already suffering low-wage American workers, will you continue to push for it? SCHUMER: The bottom line, that's not going to happen, Jeff. SESSIONS: Well, you have to read the statistics. You didn't have hearings with these top economists who studied this over the years publicly, to determine the impact. And they say it will have that impact, as does the civil rights commission members. SCHUMER: First of all -- let me just answer. First of all, it's very logical, right now, who's pulling down wage rates? Illegal people who cross the border and will work because they're illegal and have no protections for much less than Americans will work for. Second, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, one of the most conservative true blue economists said this will raise wages and increase GDP. Cato institute, people who you usually agree with, Jeff, say this is going to be a shot in the arm for our economy because we'll take people in who will create jobs and prevent people who are coming in from lowering wages and taking away American jobs. It's such a logical approach. SESSIONS: Well, it's logical that if you bring in a massive supply of low-wage workers, you're going to pull the workers down. SCHUMER: They're already here, though, aren't they? SESSIONS: Well, you're talking about almost doubling the... SCHUMER: That's the point, isn't it? SESSIONS: You're bringing in huge more numbers of legal workers, Chuck. And the ag people that you've been listening to are getting what they want, others are getting what they want, but it will impact and... KARL: Very quickly, and then I have to move on -- Senator Schumer... SCHUMER: Jonathan, the bottom line is very simple, the number of illegal people will greatly decrease and the number of legal people will not equal the number of illegals who cross the border. But they will have to be part -- let me just finish. They will have to be part of our society. They will not be able to bring down wages, work for less than minimum wage, be in the shadows, et cetera. So, it's very good. Why do you think labor is supporting this proposal, not because it will bring down wages, but because it will be a real opportunity for Americans to gain more jobs. So, I need to move on to the other big compromise -- and I know you guys also don't see eye to eye on this, this guns compromise. And, Senator Schumer, obviously you were part of crafting this Toomey-Manchin agreement on background checks, which looks like it has a chance. But can you be blunt, honest, candid, forthright with me here, the other aspects of the president's agenda are going to go nowhere, right? We are not going to see an assault weapons ban come out of the senate, are we? SCHUMER: Well, look, we're going to fight as hard as we can for -- I am anyway, for assault weapons ban and limitation on clips. But the sweet spot is background checks. It will do the most good, according to all the experts, in terms of preventing criminals and those adjudicated mentally ill, from getting guns and at the same time, has the best chance of passing. Having said that, Jonathan, it's a hard road. Not all of the Republicans who voted to allow debate are going to vote with us on background checks. So, it's going to be a tough fight to even get the 60 votes we need for the Manchin-Toomey proposal. KARL: And in fact you're not going to have all of the Democrats. You had a number of red state Democrats who simply don't like what we're seeing, even on the background checks. Let me look at two of them, Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, said in our party -- in our part of the country, this isn't an issue, this is a way of life. This is how people feel. I'm going to represent my state. And Senator Max Baucus, Montana, said I don't support the bill. Montanans are opposed to this bill by a very large margin. How are you going to convince Democrats to get on board? SCHUMER: Well, we're going to have the overwhelming majority of Democrats be for this. But as you know well, Jonathan, in the senate, you can't get anything major done because you need 60 votes without bipartisan support. And we're working really hard to maximize both, the number of Democrats who will be the overwhelming majority of those who vote for it, and a number of Republicans. The key battle is with a handful of Republicans who voted for closing debate, but haven't yet committed on background checks, even the modifications that Manchin and Toomey have proposed. And there as a no, but both got A-ratings from the NRA in the past. KARL: Probably not any more. Senator Sessions, you obviously oppose this. Are you going to be able to stop it or are background checks going to pass? SESSIONS: Before I get that, I just want to say this bill as we understand it, on immigration, will increase the legal flow of low-skill, low-wage workers and it will adversely impact workers. KARL: But very quickly, are you going to be able to defeat the background checks? SESSIONS: I don't think it's going to pass. The president of the United States has allowed, each year he's been here, the prosecutions of gun cases to go down. I was a federal prosecutor. I prosecuted those. He needs to prosecute the laws that we have today. They've declined every year since President Bush left office. KARL: Senator Schumer, before we go, need to ask you about somebody who -- some have called your former protege, Anthony Weiner, obviously left congress in disgrace, now is considering a run for mayor. I don't expect you to make any endorsements in the mayor's race, but tell me, does Anthony Weiner deserve a second chance? SCHUMER: Look, I'm not going to comment on that. How did I know you'd ask that question, Jonathan? KARL: You're not going to comment at all? Do you think he... KARL: Not even whether he deserves a second chance? KARL: No comment at all? That is rare. We have Senator Schumer with a no comment. Thank you very much, senator. Appreciate it. Thank you for coming on ""This Week."" SCHUMER: Time and season for everything, Jonathan. SESSIONS: Thank you. I appreciate the talk and the work they've done. We've got a lot of work to do yet. And we need to read their bill. KARL: All right. Thank you very much. Coming up, our powerhouse roundtable on guns, immigration and the secret recordings of Mitch McConnell's campaign strategy sessions. Plus, our exclusive on Jackie Robinson's legacy, with another number 42, Yankee legend Mariano Rivera. KARL: Twitter got more crowded this week with President Bill Clinton jumping in, thanks toStephen Colbert. STEPHEN COLBERT, COLBERT REPORT: Would you like to break into the 21st Century right now and send your first tweet? BILL CLINTON, FRM. PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Just spent... COLBERT: ...just spent. CLINTON: ...amazing time with Colbert. CLINTON: Is -- question. Is he sane? Sir, welcome to the future. MANCHIN: I'm a parent. I'm a grandparent. I can't imagine, I just -- I can do something. I can do something. MICHELLE OBAMA, FIRST LADY: I urge them to use their lives to give meaning to Hadiya Pendleton's life. I urge them to dream as big as she did and work as hard as she did and live a life that honors every last bit of her God-given promise. KARL: That was the first lady and Senator Joe Manchin, part of an emotional week in the gun debate. We'll get to that in a moment, but first, we have our roundtable. George Will, as always, Ruth Marcus of the Washington Post, Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, Republican chairman of the judiciary committee, Luis Gutierrez, Democrat of Illinois, Kim Strassel with the Wall Street Journal. George, right to you. You heard a debate among Republicans on immigration, which side should the Republican Party come down on? GEORGE WILL, CONSERVATIVE COLUMNIST: Every conservative sympathizes with what Jeff Sessions was saying about not rewarding law breaking, however, conservatism begins with facing facts. The facts are that of the 11 million people who are here illegally, two-thirds have been a decade or more, 30 percent, 15 years or more. They're woven into our society. They're not leaving. And the American people would not tolerate the police measures necessary to extract them from our community. Therefore, the great consensus has to be on the details of a path to citizenship. The most important thing Rubio said in your interview was, even if the system weren't broken, if you had no illegal immigrants, we'd still need to do something about this because we need the workers, as the baby boomers retire, and as the birthrate declines. We need something to replenish the workplace to sustain the welfare state. KARL: The framing from Rubio was interesting, saying we really already have amnesty. Nobody's prosecuting the undocumented immigrants here now. MARCUS: Absolutely, I want to say I'm going to really enjoy saying this next sentence. I completely agree with every syllable that George Will just said. And I think that the stars are in alignment for many of the reasons that he said. The issue is less of a hot button that it was, in part because net migration from Mexico is zero. Technology has been our friend on immigration, both in the workplace and in terms of drone surveillance on the border. It's easier to achieve enforcement. And Republicans, most of them, have realized not just the facts on the ground of immigration, but the political facts on the ground, that their party is going to have to get right on this issue. KARL: But Mr. Chairman we've been here before. I mean 2006, the Senate, 61 votes I think it was 62 votes passed Immigration Reform. And it died in the House. Because Republicans in the House wouldn't even bring it up. Is that going to happen again this time? KARL: But it passed in 2006. GOODLATTE: OK well look, the fact of the matter is we have to learn the lessons of both 1986 and 2007. In 1986 we passed an Immigration Law that allowed close to three million people to get here, to stay here and get permanent resident status. And if they wanted citizenship. --by every president, not just the current one, have been only honored in the breech. That is a key question that has to be addressed this time. The second time, 2007, I think it failed because it was done from the top down. And the Senate right now is at a critical point. KARL: Is that a problem for you? GOODLATTE: Not a problem for me. But it is a problem how they go from here. It is absolutely important that they follow regular order, Marco Rubio is right, that they have a full exposition of it. He said this morning to you, it would be wonderful to have the other 92 Senators have their full input in this process and bring it from the ground up. The same thing you see happen in the House. KARL: But a quick bottom line, do you think what he's talking about, what Rubio's talking about, could you envision it passing in the House? GOODLATTE: I think, I think the specifics of that bill will be different than the specifics of the bill in the House. But we have to address legal immigration and reform, we have to address enforcement. And we have to address what we do with 11 million or more people who are not lawfully here. And I think we can do that in a bipartisan way. We got to get the enforcement part right. And not just what the law says, but making sure that no one person, President of the United States, can flip a switch and not enforce the law as many presidents have done before. That's going to be a key, key question here. GUTIERREZ: I haven't seen in my memory, at least my 20 years, such a dramatic and sudden change in attitude towards a public policy issue, like the one we've seen after November 6, among the members of Congress and the House of Representatives. The fact that Chairman Goodlatte and I can be on this program together and agree that we're going to move forward on resolving our broken immigration system, I think demonstrates that sea change that exists. Look I've been working on this issue for 20 years. We're making real progress. I see real history being written in this Congress, and I see it written this year and signed by the President of the United States. Next Tuesday, next Monday, the 22nd, Representative Paul Ryan is going to come down from Michigan and join me before the City Club. KARL: You guys always hang out so, sure. GUTIERREZ: Ryan and Gutierrez are always the best (inaudible). Interestingly enough, they sold out in 12 minutes, they went online. KARL: So bipartisanship is breaking out on Capitol Hill. Kim, you're skeptical? STRASSEL: Just to put a little bit of downer on this. I think it is amazing what we have seen so far. And yes it's all incredibly optimistic. This is the point that things become difficult. Now you're going to have language in a bill, it's going to come out. You're going to have hearings. And I think one thing to keep your eye on too is that there has been some focus on Republicans being the ones who have not been in favor of this in the past. In fact, if you go back and you look back at the legislative record, the real problem with immigration is you've had common cause within those on the right and on the left. So on the right, those who don't want immigration, on the left, often unions, for instance, who don't want a guest worker program, who don't want some of this. And you've seen Republican and Democratic members come together to poison pill some of these pieces of legislation. We don't know if that's going to come out yet. It's good news the people who are leading this, are coming out very boldly and talking as strongly as they have been. And we also don't know too what role the White House is going to play in this yet. GUTIERREZ: In the House of Representatives, I mean Raul Labrador, from Idaho, a Tea Party favorite, is leading on this issue. There are, those, I mean I remember reading, they said, well you can't put Luis Gutierrez and Raul Labrador, an extreme left and an extreme right person in the room and reach a bipartisan. I think we are going to work to reach that. Let me just also suggest, 1,400 people are deported every day. So to say that the system doesn't have an ill effect on a community and that there is no enforcement, 1,400 will be today, tomorrow, 1.6 million. It's having a devastating effect. And to just follow up on what George Will said one of the things that he didn't mention that we could act, there are millions of American citizen children, their parents are the undocumented. We need to resolve this for those children. MARCUS: And I think Kim makes a really good point but it's the reason I'm optimistic. The usual frictions between labor and business, I think have been largely resolved. The business community, small business and big business, is much more unified than it has been. I think the civil rights community, the Latino community, the White House is in a very, very pragmatic approach. They're not insisting on an instant get citizenship tomorrow or five years from now. I think the big sticking point is going to be the trigger for enforcement. What will, is this going to be bring me the witches broomstick enforcement, where you'll never be able to certify, that yes you can have this path. That's a sticking point. But I'm feeling very optimistic. KARL: Kim and Ruth are both right. KARL: Here's the thing. If we don't get the enforcement right, not just from the standpoint of what the law says but how it's going to be carried out. We haven't yet talked about for example, are we just going to rely upon the federal government? A thin group of 5,000 Enforcement Agents across this large country, to enforce the law in the future, or are we going to allow state and local law enforcement to participate in this in a way they've not been allowed to in the past. GUTIERREZ: And I think we can do them both at the same time. Look here's what I believe, the community, the Immigrant community voted, the vote on November 6. It was to say, take the 11 million and put them in a safe place. That is, stop the deportations, allow those parents to raise those children, get them right with the law. Give them a Social Security card, put them on tax role. Give up their fingerprints. Everybody keeps telling me, well Republicans, they like this more, the more they hear about background checks for the immigrants. GUTIERREZ: But that's fine. There isn't a problem. Because what immigrants are saying to me is, where do I write the check out to pay the fine? Where do I take that English class so I can get right with the law? GOODLATTE: To answer your first question to George, I think the key to this is making sure that Conservatives understand that this is an opportunity to fix a broken system and get it right. And so when we see things in the Senate bill, when we see things that the House Group of Eight are working on in a bipartisan fashion, it's been going on for years by the way. When we see them, and we don't like them, we need to say, here is how we will fix that. As opposed to here is how we will be opposed and not address this problem. KARL: I've got to move on to the other big bipartisan thing we saw this week, which was gun control. The President had, did something extraordinary over the weekend. He turned over the weekly address to Francine Wheeler, her six-year-old son Ben, was killed at Newtown. Take a listen. WHEELER: In the four months since we lost our loved ones, thousands of other Americans have died at the end of a gun. Please help us do something before our tragedy becomes your tragedy."" KARL: So the NRA actually lost a vote this week. I mean, you know, the vote, procedural vote to move forward on gun control. But doesn't the NRA still hold the cards here? STRASSEL: Well I think gun rights are, people, gun owners out in the country are what most of these senators are concerned about. And that is the problem. You talked about a bipartisan compromise, you had one Republican Senator. KARL: Yeah but Pat Toomey is not exactly a squish. I mean this isn't like (inaudible). STRASSEL: No but here's the real issue on this. What you really want, and what happened in Newtown, it's worthy of all the emotion you're seeing this week OK? But there's an obligation to do something that is effective in actually dealing with this. I think one of the problems that this amendment is going to have is that what you want is a system whereby law abiding gun owners who make up the majority of people who own guns, have the ability to go, and you help them to be able to check and use a background system, if they need to, to see and reassure themselves that they are actually selling their gun to somebody who's not a bad person. That's not what this does. This expands the current system. Government, big government reach. You're also going to be required to keep records that law enforcement is going to be able to access. STRASSEL: This (inaudible) a huge no-no of gun owners, and it's, why because they decided to go as far as they did on this amendment, that you're not likely to get both a huge number of Republicans or even a lot of Democrats, as you mentioned. WILL: It should be, as Kim says, effective. It also should be congruent with the Bill of Rights of which the Second Amendment is a part. Now, it is part of the tragedy of this tragedy is that it occurred at Sandy Hook, immediately as the President began after the election. He has spent an inordinate amount of time and energy in what will be the most precious moments of his second term probably, the early months here, on this. We're not going to get a ban on what are meretriciously called assault weapons that are simply semi-automatic weapons. WILL: Forty percent of all weapons sold in the country. We are not going to get universal background checks. We're not going to get a ban on magazines. MARCUS: I do. Will it, I do not think we're going to get assault weapon ban. MARCUS: I do not think we're going to get magazine limits. I think we're at a rather extraordinary moment where it's easier for Republican and Democratic politicians to support same sex marriage than it is for them to support the same law that was passed in 1994. None and so there, to the extent that there is the possibility and I think there is the possibility of progress. It's going to be limited progress on expanding the background check system that is already in place. Would that have prevented Newtown? No. Could that prevent future Newtowns? Yes. Will it stop everybody who's determined to buy a guy who isn't entitled to buy a guy from getting one? No. Will it stop some people? Yes. The existing background check system where if you fail your background check, you can just go buy one at a gun show has gotten two million, stopped two million transactions. Some of those people went and got other guns. That would be harder under this. But some of them didn't go and get other guns. KARL: Well what's wrong with background checks? GOODLATTE: Well first of all, the issue is, are you going to require law abiding citizens to face greater burdens to no effect. That, in my opinion, is the issue here. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There you go. KARL: It's a quick check though isn't it? I mean, two days, maximum. MARCUS: It takes seven minutes. GOODLATTE: And there's no distinction between a sale online or a sale offline. There's no sense, you can't mail a gun through the mail from somebody after they buy it from you online. You still have to go and get it from them. It's illegal to mail the gun. GOODLATTE: And then enforce the law and work to get more data in the mix. GUTIERREZ: I'll tell you who is applauding and who's clapping any lack of success on gun control, gang bangers and drug dealers across this country. They're happy and delighted. Because they are murdering and killing young people each and every day. STRASSEL: But they don't follow the law now. GOODLATTE: You think they're going to do a background check? GUTIERREZ: Yet I think it is the beginning of a conversation we need to have in America to control guns. GUTIERREZ: I need to do everything I can to ensure that another young woman like (inaudible) doesn't get murdered on the streets of Chicago. GOODLATTE: I'm all for the First Amendment conversation, but not at the expense of the Second Amendment. GUTIERREZ: But it isn't at the expense. It's at the expense of our youth, our youth in this country. MARCUS: Don't get the issue that (inaudible) and I, (inaudible) and I are both big believers in the constitution, we interpret it slightly differently. What is the infringement on Second Amendment rights to ask people to have a background check and to keep some record of that? The government is going to go rifling willy-nilly through people's files. It's going to give them ability, if there is a crime committed with the gun you've sold, to maybe go back and trace it to you. Everybody should welcome that. GOODLATTE: Can I answer that? KARL: Sure, go ahead. GOODLATTE: So we have determined that the 76,000 people who were found to have liked on the background check in 2010, 4,700 were referred by the ATF for further investigation, prosecution, 62 of them were prosecuted. Every Republican on the House Judiciary Committee signed a letter to the President and the Attorney General asking why that is? And why there isn't greater enforcement. Enforcement's down 40 percent overall in his administration. The answer we got about the background checks was those are ""paper crimes."" Well they're not paper crimes, they're felonies because they're perjury and if you set the example of lying when you do a background check and prosecuting them, you'll have fewer people trying that. But why would the solution to that be in creating more paper crimes. GUTIERREZ: And so we should enforce the law also, and also make sure that we improve the law. So I'm with you on it. So just so that we get clear, George Bush's presidency had the same dismal record on enforcement of the background checks as this presidency has during the last four years. Let's improve it together so we can improve the quality of life. GUTIERREZ: I think 9 out of 10 people in America have said we can do reasonable background checks without infringing on people's right to bear arms. KARL: We're just about out of time. I do before we leave, want to talk about this Beyonce Jay-Z, there's a serious issue about whether or not we should have a Cuba Trade Embargo, Travel Ban. Jay-Z in his response on this said, I'm in Cuba, I love Cubans. The communist talk is so confusing when it's from China, the very mic that I'm using. I mean, he has a point George. This has been an odd policy. Trade with countries that are far worse on human rights than Cuba. WILL: The Cuban Embargo may have made a lot of sense during the Cold War. The Cold War is over. And it is hard to think of a policy more firmly refuted by events than the policy of the embargo which is supposed to weaken one of the, it turns out, most durable dictators in the world. KARL: That might be something Ruth Marcus also agrees with you on. Thank you very much. MARCUS: I'm getting a little scared here. KARL: I think you to all of our roundtable. Up next, Jackie Robinson's legacy. Our conversation with the greatest relief pitcher of all time, Mariano Rivera. KIMMEL: Did you hear the latest from Iran today? The Iranian government is claiming that their scientists have developed a time machine, which could explain how their leader got all those 1980's Members Only jackets. O'BRIEN: Jay-Z and Beyonce created a controversy by traveling to Cuba. And the Treasury Department is now saying that when they OKed the request, they didn't know it was them. Yeah the Department said, yeah we thought it was a different Jay-Z and Beyonce. KARL: That was a clip from the new movie, ""42"" telling the story of Jackie Robinson breaking baseball's color barrier. Tomorrow all the Major League Players will wear Robinson's number in tribute. But there is only one play who wears the number 42 at every game, Yankee legend Mariano Rivera. We caught up with him at Yankee Stadium earlier this week. KARL: You are the last major league baseball player that will ever wear the number 42. RIVERA: Yes I have the privilege to be the last one to wear. KARL: What does that mean to you? RIVERA: It's not only privilege and satisfaction, its responsibility. I felt the challenge because what Mr. Jackie Robinson represent, what he did, and the legacy that he has, for us, you know, he lived for us. And as a minority, come from Panama and be the last one to wear number 42, I think it's a lot of pressure in there. I have tried my best. And tried to keep the responsibility and do my job well. KARL: You've done all right. RIVERA: I try, I try. KARL: I know you go out to every stadium in major league baseball, number 42 is out there, retired. RIVERA: Yes. Yes it is. KARL: And you've got it on your back. RIVERA: Yeah, the only one. The only one, I got it on my back. KARL: So are you going to see the movie? KARL: He faced so much, he had so much adversity. Some of his own teammates, most of them wouldn't even shake his hand when he came out on the field. Can you image that? RIVERA: Yeah I can't imagine that. I can't see that now. It took a man like Jackie Robinson to break that barrier. RIVERA: And Thank God for him, because we enjoy these moments now because of him. KARL: I always think of him, in the old footage, you've seen him play, stealing home. Which he did 10 times. RIVERA: I always talk to (inaudible) about that play. He say, (inaudible) he was out. They call him safe. KARL: Now before you go, I do have a favor I want to ask. KARL: You have the most famous, most effective pitch in the history of relief pitching. I want to know how do you throw the Rivera Cutter? KARL: I won't tell anybody. You can just tell me. RIVERA: It's just four things, you got the ball like this. RIVERA: And that's that. KARL: All I've got to do is grab the ball like that? RIVERA: Just like that. You throw it like that and it cut. OK you throw it like that. I will throw it like this. KARL: Wait why are you throwing it like that? RIVERA: Because I'm a (inaudible). You will throw like that. I will throw like this. RIVERA: So that's the way it works. KARL: And George Will is back with us. George you have a rare photograph of Jackie Robinson stepping onto the field moments, you know, a couple hours before his first game. That moment was big, not just for baseball, this was way beyond baseball. WILL: Well Jackie Robinson is the second most important African-American in our history. And April 15, 1947, was the most important day in the protracted, slow-motion emancipation of Africa-Americans, since the Civil War. Jackie Robinson was the fuse that lit the fire that was fanned into a conflagration by Martin Luther King who was 18 years old on that day when Jackie Robinson took the field. And by the time he took the field, three years after he, 11 years before, Rosa Parks refused to go to the back of the bus, Jackie Robinson as a Lieutenant in the Army was court martialed for refusing to go to the back of the bus in Ft. Hood, Texas and he won his case. KARL: And he was also a great baseball player. I mean how great? WILL: Well first of all, he was on a field what African-Americans had been discouraged from being in life, confident, aggressive and aristocratic. Four-star athlete, four-sport athlete at UCLA, football records, NCA champion broad jump, lead the Pacific Coast in basketball shooting. And he didn't get to the big leagues until he was 28. KARL: George Will, thank you very much. And now we honor our fellow Americans who serve and sacrifice. That's all for today. Thank you for sharing part of your Sunday with us. Check out World News with David Muir tonight and don't miss our web extra, I'll be answering your questions. Plus my interview with Yankee's slugger Robinson Cano, on the man he is named for, Jackie Robinson. It's all on abcnews.com/thisweek. George is back next week, we hope you will be too."	1.0

But as with any major new law, thereare many reasonable questions people have about how it affects themand their families.And, unfortunately, there are also many questions and concernsabout the new law based on misinformation. For example, I have beenasked a number of times why senators and their staff will not becovered by the law. The answer is, they will be. That is just oneof the many questions about the new law that I hear at my listeningsessions and from constituents.So to help answer these questions and correct some of themisinformation I hear about the bill, here are some frequentlyasked questions along with answers:I currently purchase my own insurance. Will this bill force meinto a public plan?No. The health care law does not create a public plan. If you likethe plan you purchase, the health care reform bill does not forceyou to change it.Now that the health care bill has become law, what about myhealth care coverage will change?The most immediate change as a result of the new health carereforms is that people will be able to enjoy new consumerprotections like not being dropped from coverage if you get sick,no lifetime limits on benefits and yearly caps on what insurancecompanies can charge you for out-of-pocket expenses. If you arelike the majority of Americans who get their health care coveragethrough work, you will not see any big changes. If you havespecific questions, you may want to discuss them with yourinsurance company or your employer.What will this do to the cost of my private insuranceplan?For Wisconsinites who purchase health care on the individual market(i.e., people who do not get insurance through their employer),experts believe this reform will lower premiums by 14 percent to 20percent compared to what the same plan would cost without healthcare insurance reform by 2016.If I can't afford to purchase insurance will I be fined?No. The new law includes subsidies to help individuals to purchasehealth insurance through exchanges. In the rare occasion it isstill unaffordable, even with the subsidies, you will not be fined.The law extends coverage to 32 million Americans who don't haveinsurance.Can I keep both my private insurance and my Medicare?Under the new law, anyone can keep Medicare and a privatesupplemental plan.Some people are saying that this new law would add trillions ofdollars to our debt and raise taxes on families and smallbusinesses by more than $500 billion. Is that true?The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has stated the new lawwill reduce our national deficits by $143 billion over the first 10years and as much as $1.2 trillion over the next 10 years. Thoseare the facts. Middle class families will benefit from the largestmiddle class tax cut ever by receiving subsidies to purchase healthinsurance and new consumer protections against health insuranceabuses. More than 77,000 small businesses in Wisconsin alone willbenefit from tax credits to purchase health insurance for their ownfamilies and employees.Do these new exchanges give Americans the same health carechoices as members of Congress?Yes. A number of Wisconsinites have expressed concern about theidea that members of Congress may be exempted from health carereform. I am pleased that that is not the case. Currently, membersof Congress, like other federal employees - including everyone frompostal workers to custodial staff - have access to affordableinsurance purchased through a federal exchange. The healthinsurance exchanges set up by this new law will operate in asimilar manner to make sure that all Americans in the exchangeshave access to good, affordable, health care choices. Under the newlaw, Sen. Russ Feingold and his staff will be required to purchasetheir health insurance in the new state exchanges once thoseexchanges are operating (Sec. 1312 of PPACA, pages 157 and158).How does the new law make health care affordable?Because of this new law, 541,000 Wisconsinites who are uninsuredand 320,000 Wisconsinites who purchase health insurance through theindividual market will have access to better and more affordableinsurance. Furthermore, this bill provides tax credits for up to358,000 Wisconsinites to help make health insurance moreaffordable, bringing $5.8 billion in premium and cost-sharing taxcredits into Wisconsin during the first five years of the healthinsurance exchange.Will this new law cost jobs?Actually, it could create thousands of new jobs. By slowing thegrowth rate of health care costs, it will be more profitable forbusinesses to expand employment. The state exchanges set up by thisnew law also help ensure that entrepreneurs are not prevented fromlaunching a new business because they can't afford the cost ofcare. One analysis predicts that this slowing of the growth ratewill lead to anywhere between 5,600 and 9,000 new jobs each year inWisconsin.I've been told this new law is terrible for small businesses. Isthat true?Where small businesses make up 76 percent of Wisconsin businesses,less than 38 percent of them are able to offer health insuranceright now. Because of this new law, more than 77,000 smallbusinesses in Wisconsin could receive a tax credit making healthcare coverage for employees more affordable.I keep hearing that this new law will be paid for through endingwaste, fraud and abuse in our health care system. What does thatmean?According to the non-partisan experts at the Congressional Budget Office, because ofthis new law, over the next 10 years, our national deficit willdecrease by $143 billion and up to $1.2 trillion in the following10 years. Those savings come from a number of cost-containmentprovisions. A major one is reimbursing physicians based on thequality of care they provide rather than the quantity of care. Thisis called value-based health care purchasing, and it will helpreward some of the high-quality care provided by hospitals andmedical groups around Wisconsin such as the Marshfield Clinic,Gundersen Lutheran and Franciscan Skemp.Hospitals will be held accountable to reduce preventable hospitalreadmissions and preventable health care acquired infections.Increasingly, their payments will be linked to improving theirquality and the outcomes of their care. Physicians will also bepaid based on quality of care and not on the volume of servicesthey provide. This will curb the ordering of unnecessary tests andprocedures that can be very expensive. A new Independent PaymentAdvisory Board will identify ways to lower costs, improve outcomes,promote quality and expand access to evidence-basedcare.We will also save billions over the next decade through cutting thecost of drugs purchased through Medicaid. One example is aprovision of Feingold's Control Spending Now Act, included in thenew health care bill. The government is able to purchase drugsincluded under the fee-for-service component of Medicaid at adiscounted price. The new health care law extends the ability topurchase discounted drugs to managed care organizations to providetreatment to Medicaid beneficiaries. CBO estimates this change willsave $11 billion over 10 years.I'm a Medicare beneficiary with high prescription drug costs - howdoes this new law help me?Beginning this year, if a Medicare beneficiary spends more than$2,830 on prescription drug costs in the Part D ""doughnut hole,"" heor she will receive a $250 rebate check in the mail. Starting in2011, a 50 percent discount on any brand-name drug costs incurredwhile in the doughnut hole will be available. Subsidies for genericdrug costs will also begin to be phased in starting in 2011. Thesesubsidies will increase year by year, until the doughnut hole isfully closed in 2020.My child just graduated from college and doesn't have healthinsurance. Does this new law provide any new options?Effective six months after enactment, both group health plans andplans in the individual market that provide dependent coverage forchildren must continue to make that coverage available until thechild turns 26 years of age.Who is eligible for the exchanges?The health reform bill authorizes states to create insuranceexchanges or marketplaces where small business and people who donot have coverage through their employer can shop for insurance.States may choose whether to combine these two markets (individualmarket and small group market) into one exchange, or have separateexchanges for each. Insurers will bid to sell policies in theexchanges, and must meet certain minimum requirements in terms ofbenefits and cost to participate. The exchanges will be up andrunning by 2014.

It would lift the mandate that Americans have insurance, change the subsidies that help some pay for it, and cause the number of people with coverage to plunge by as much as 23 million over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.But the aspects that have generated the most political friction, and that might affect the most people, in New York are those dealing with Medicaid. The government insurance program expanded its reach under the Affordable Care Act and now covers nearly one in three New Yorkers. Pending bills in Congress would cut or cap New York's Medicaid funding in four separate ways. Jason Helgerson, the state's Medicaid director, told the Times Herald-Record last week that he estimates those changes, once fully phased in, could cost the state as much as $8 billion or $9 billion a year, for a program that costs $65.5 billion this year.The result is a sharp debate over Medicaid's role and cost and the effect that ""Trumpcare"" would have on its beneficiaries and on hospitals in New York.Helgerson argues the cuts would reverse coverage gains New York has made and have a devastating effect on upstate hospitals and the local economies they support. ""Medicaid is the biggest payer of health care services in New York,"" he said, arguing that reducing that funding would force hospitals to lay off employees or even close. In rural areas where those operations are the largest employers, the impact could trigger a ripple effect on the economy, Helgerson said.Rep. John Faso, the Republican freshman whose district includes Ulster and Sullivan counties, has been prominent in the debate because of a bill amendment he sponsored that would force New York to stop requiring its counties outside New York City to shoulder part of the Medicaid expenses. He argues that the federal government must slow Medicaid's spending growth because the current pace is ""not sustainable,"" and that New York would adjust to the changes without the dire consequences that Gov. Andrew Cuomo and other critics predict.But he also suggests the Medicaid program itself has grown beyond its original purpose and now covers more people than it should.""We now have about one third of New York's population on Medicaid,"" Faso said. ""Some people in Albany may look upon that as an accomplishment. I look upon that as a failure.""Local impactFrom Warwick to Woodstock, from Newburgh to Callicoon, households and a variety of institutions rely on Medicaid to pay for costly services.It pays for child births and dental care and diabetes drugs in densely populated areas where poverty is concentrated, places like Newburgh and Kiryas Joel, but also in largely rural areas like Sullivan County, where one in three residents is enrolled in Medicaid.It pays for services for people with disabilities, such as children with autism at the Center for Spectrum Services in Kingston and Ellenville.It is a primary funding source for the elderly and infirm living in 21 nursing homes with 3,100 total beds in Orange, Ulster and Sullivan counties.It pays for addiction treatment in the midst of a national heroin and prescription pill epidemic.Frank Petrucci, a 28-year-old Warwick resident who suffers from a rare, debilitating disease, relies on Medicaid to pay the $50,000 bill each time he goes to the hospital for an intravenous drug treatment to prevent his condition from getting worse, at intervals of six weeks or two months. Without those treatments, the disease is likely to progress and make him more and more incapacitated, taking away his ability to take care of himself, drive and work part-time. A national rower before his ailment set in, Petrucci coaches several times a week at the East Arm Rowing Club in Greenwood Lake. Whether and how a reduction in Medicaid funding would affect his coverage is uncertain. Petrucci, who has closely watched the legislative debate as it unfolds in Washington, said he's covered now because of his low income. If the state is forced to curtail eligibility for his income level, could he qualify instead because of his disability? Would he have to allow his condition to worsen without treatment until he was disabled enough? Would the wait for disability coverage require him to go even longer without treatment?""If that's removed, then my world becomes a smaller place,"" Petrucci said, referring to the loss of mobility he would likely suffer.What he knows for sure is that he's an expensive patient and probably will remain so for many years. ""I'm young, and this disease is most likely a lifelong disease,"" he said.Heated debateThe amendment Faso sponsored with Rep. Chris Collins would force the state to absorb the $2.3 billion that 57 counties now spend on Medicaid or else cut that amount from its spending. Faso argues that imposing a cost share on New York's counties when Medicaid began 51 years ago was a bad mistake, one that now helps drive up property taxes and cause residents to leave New York. Shifting the counties' expense to Albany is ""restoring responsibility,"" he said.Faso contends the state could shoulder that responsibility by cutting waste and fraud from Medicaid and other unnecessary state spending. He dismissed Cuomo's contention that the state might recover the lost revenue from its counties in some other manner, saying the Legislature would never approve it.""It's time for him to man up and do what 49 other governors have done,"" Faso said.On a broader level, Faso said that increased dependence on Medicaid is ""not a desirable thing,"" and that government should be ""striving to get people into private insurance.""""It was not meant to be an insurance policy for able-bodied adults,"" he said.Helgerson counters that at a time when fewer employers give their workers health insurance, Medicaid has helped the state cut its rate of uninsured residents in half, a feat it celebrates without apology.""Does Congressman Faso want to double the uninsured rate in New York?"" he asked.Bill Hammond, director of health policy for the Albany-based Empire Center for Public Policy, said he sympathizes with Republicans' quest to control Medicaid spending, which he said is ""growing faster than our ability to pay."" He also agreed with Faso that New York's Medicaid program contains a ""fairly large amount of waste"" - as any public or private insurance program does.But he pointed out that cutting Medicaid spending to absorb the county costs would have a double impact, since the state would then lose a dollar-for-dollar amount in federal funding. And he argued that the legislation under debate in Washington would have to offer Medicaid enrollees enough financial support for private insurance to make that a ""reasonable alternative.""""It's just unreasonable for them to find a couple thousand dollars a year to buy health insurance,"" Hammond said.Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, the Cold Spring Democrat whose district includes Orange County, argues that Republicans undermined their rationale for cutting Medicaid spending growth as a fiscal necessity by proposing to eliminate two taxes on high-income earners in the same legislation. Their position would have more integrity, he said, if the savings had been used to balance the budget.""This whole thing is a scheme to cut taxes for the rich,"" he said.Maloney applauded the drop in New York's uninsured rate - to 4.5 percent from 9.5 percent - and said 55,000 people in his district alone had gotten coverage through the Medicaid expansion.""Maybe John Faso thinks too many people have health care,"" he said.

Michigan DNR Marine Biologist Dr. Debra Polowotski arrived at Good Harbor Bay and confirmed the 21 foot-long giant squid to be a very rare fresh-water species of genus Architeuthis. “We thought they were already in Lake Erie, we had no idea they were in Lake Michigan. This is first time there’s been an actual specimen recovered, so this is very exciting”, she said. It is believed that a few of the squid escaped from the Cleveland Sea World complex during the great Northeast blackout of 2003 when they were very young, and somehow made it into Lake Erie. According to Dr. Polowotski, the squid were kept contained in Lake Erie, as the Detroit River is too narrow and shallow for the squid to swim upstream. “They are intimidated by closed-in spaces. They need a lot of room. You have to remember that this is a very big animal”, she said. Dr. Polotwotski also confirmed that the squid is a female and further examination of the corpse indicated that it had recently laid eggs. “Hopefully the walleye can keep the tiny-giant squid population under control, else there is some cause for concern”, said Dr. Polowotski. “Boaters and swimmers really need to exercise some caution”. The animal was discovered by Bob Ritchie and his sister Jill, both of Romeo. “We were just, you know, taking an evening walk along the beach, heading out to the sandbar when we stumbled across it”, said Bob. “We were singing, drinking whiskey out of the bottle, not thinking about tomorrow. But something like this really does make you stop and think”, he said. DNR officials removed the animal from the beach and took it to an undisclosed location for further study.2New Laws in VA to Ban Hiding ""painted rocks"" in Public Spaces A new law goes into effect September 1st 2017 that will essentially make it a misdemeanor to paint rocks.

Even after increasing taxes by nearly $2 trillion, Barack Obama will somehow manage to add more than $8 trillion to the national debt, which is more debt than the 43 presidents who held office before him compiled together.As a result of the reckless spending in Washington, a child born today like my new grandson, Jack, comes into the world with nearly $60,000 of debt on his or her back.The next president of the United States must tackle the spending and debt crisis., and leadership starts with being honest with the American people.In 1965, health care programs and Social Security spending consumed less than a sixth of Washington’s budget. Today, they consume almost half of federal spending and are crowding out investments in national defense, roads and bridges, law enforcement and other national priorities. The retirement of the baby boom generation and the aging of America is exacerbating the problem. Consider that in 1950, there were 16 workers paying taxes into Social Security for every senior collecting benefits. Today the ratio is 3 to 1 and it will fall to 2 to 1 in a few short years.The status quo isn’t sustainable, and unless the next president and Congress, honestly address entitlement reform, today’s seniors and future retirees could face massive benefit cuts of as much as 25 percent. I believe we should act now rather than inflict this level of pain on seniors. Of all the candidates running for president, I have put forward the most detailed plans to preserve and protect Social Security and Medicare.As the former governor of Florida, the state with one of the largest senior populations in the country, I understand and respect how important Social Security and Medicare are to ensuring a comfortable retirement for the American people. I would never do anything to weaken these programs or break the promise that has been made to workers who pay into Social Security and Medicare. The reform plan I have released would extend the solvency of the Social Security trust fund for 75 years, ensuring that today’s seniors and the next generation of retirees are protected.Given the fact that we are living longer and healthier lives, it is only prudent that we increase the retirement age in a responsible way. Today’s seniors and those close to retiring would receive no change in the eligibility age for Social Security. But for younger people, we need to gradually increase the retirement age from 67 to 70. I also believe that we should make it easier for seniors who want to continue to work to do so. My plan would eliminate the payroll tax on seniors at age 67 to encourage more people to continue participating in the workforce. I would also reform the benefit structure to ensure that the minimum Social Security benefit is set at 150 percent of the poverty line. Today, the minimum benefit falls below the poverty threshold. This is wrong and I am committed to providing low-income seniors with a level of benefits that ensures they can live a life of dignity in retirement. I would pay for this reform and extend the solvency of the Social Security trust fund by means-testing benefits for wealthy seniors who have ample personal retirement savings.Regarding Medicare, I believe the best way to reform the system is to open it up to more competition.If seniors want to continue participating in traditional Medicare that option should be preserved for them, but we should also give seniors the right to choose from a menu of high quality private plans that may offer benefit packages that are more attractive. As a conservative, I believe deeply in the power of competition to deliver positive change. I have seen it time and again in my 32 years in the private sector, and I know it will work for Medicare as well. Finally, to better shore up Medicare’s finances, I would also apply greater means testing for wealthier seniors.Liberals like Hillary Clinton are not being honest with the American people about the impending crisis in Social Security and Medicare. They want the American people to believe that doing nothing is a viable option. To ensure that seniors and future retirees can receive Social Security and Medicare benefits that provide them with peace of mind during their retirement years, we must be bold and courageous and tell the truth to the American people. My plan does that and when I am president of the United States I will work to bring Republicans and Democrats together around solutions that preserve and protect Social Security and Medicare.	1.0

I will nominate judges who will look to the text, original understanding, history, and structure of the Constitution for answers — not to their own views about public policy, to the popular opinion of the moment, or to what might win favor on liberal newspaper editorial pages. They will defer to the elected branches on issues where the Constitution is silent. But when laws conflict with the Constitution, they will not hesitate to strike them down.I believe the federal courts are at a crossroads. The next president will help to determine whether we move further away from constitutional government, or correct course. We cannot afford to elect a president who will pack the courts with ‘politicians in robes’ who subvert the law to advance their own political agendas. We need a president who will nominate individuals with a record of respecting the difference between judges and legislators — which is exactly what I pledge to do.I have a proven record of appointing conservatives to the Florida judiciary as governor, and my administration devoted substantial time to vetting nominees. We sought judges who had shown humility, courage, an appreciation of the duties of a judge, a respect for the will of the people, and devotion to full application of the law without equivocation. My two appointments to the Florida Supreme Court, Raoul Cantero and Kenneth Bell, have earned reputations as its most consistent conservatives. Additionally, two of the appellate judges I named as governor, Charles Canady and Ricky Polston, are now serving with distinction on the Florida Supreme Court.I will approach nominations to the federal courts and the U.S. Supreme Court with the same rigor and care. My strategy is to assemble the broadest possible pool of candidates who meet the core qualifications, scour their records and vet their references. Only those people with a history of respecting both the limits of government power and the will of the people will stay on the list. The final criterion will be to identify those most willing to stand up for the law, even when it runs contrary to their own ideology.If our court system continues in the wrong direction, we face a troubling future. Our strong tradition of religious liberty, which is already under assault, could erode precipitously. The right to bear arms could be read out of our Constitution. Judicial fiat could end school-choice programs that have given hope to children across our country. The states could be reduced to mere administrative sub-units of the federal government. Liberal dogma could block reasonable protections for unborn children, even when most people agree on them.So, this is my promise: I will fight for the confirmation of my judicial nominees. They will all have a long, clear conservative record. Opposition from Senate Democrats is all but guaranteed. I am eager to fight for good judges, to make the case in the court of public opinion, and I am confident that those of us who believe in judicial fidelity to the Constitution will win the battle.Read more on Jeb2016.com .	1.0

He outlined his tax plan , including how he’d cut corporate taxe s. Below you can read the full transcript of the speech, entitled “An America First Economic Plan: Winning the Global Competition.”Thank you for the invitation to speak to you today. It’s wonderful to be in Detroit. We now begin a great national conversation about economic renewal for America. It’s a conversation about how to Make American Great Again for everyone, and especially those who have the very least.The City of Detroit Is Where Our Story BeginsDetroit was once the economic envy of the world. The people of Detroit helped power America to its position of global dominance in the 20th century.When we were governed by an America First policy, Detroit was booming. Engineers, builders, laborers, shippers and countless others went to work each day, provided for their families, and lived out the American Dream.But for many living in this city, that dream has long ago vanished.When we abandoned the policy of America First, we started rebuilding other countries instead of our own. The skyscrapers went up in Beijing, and in many other cities around the world, while the factories and neighborhoods crumbled in Detroit. Our roads and bridges fell into disrepair, yet we found the money to resettle millions of refugees at taxpayer expense.Today, Detroit has a per capita income of under $15,000 dollars, about half of the national average. 40 percent of the city’s residents live in poverty, over two-and-half times the national average. The unemployment rate is more than twice the national average. Half of all Detroit residents do not work.Detroit tops the list of Most Dangerous Cities in terms of violent crime – these are the silenced victims whose stories are never told by Hillary Clinton, but victims whose suffering is no less real or permanent.In short, the city of Detroit is the living, breathing example of my opponent’s failed economic agenda. Every policy that has failed this city, and so many others, is a policy supported by Hillary Clinton.She supports the high taxes and radical regulation that forced jobs out of your community…and the crime policies that have made you less safe…and the immigration policies that have strained local budgets…and the trade deals like NAFTA, signed by her husband, that have shipped your jobs to Mexico and other countries… and she supports the education policies that deny your students choice, freedom and opportunity.For more on Donald Trump, watch this Fortune video:She is the candidate of the past.Ours is the campaign of the future.This is a city controlled by Democratic politicians at every level, and unless we change policies, we will not change results.Today, I will outline my economic vision. In the coming weeks, we will be offering more detail on all of these policies, and the ones we have already rolled out can be viewed on my campaign website.Our opposition, on the other hand, has long ago run out of ideas. All Hillary Clinton has to offer is more of the same: more taxes, more regulations, more bureaucrats, more restrictions on American energy and American production.If you were a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn’t do better than Hillary Clinton’s economic agenda.Nothing would make our foreign adversaries happier than for our country to tax and regulate our companies and our jobs out of existence.The one common feature of every Hillary Clinton idea is that it punishes you for working and doing business in the United States. Every policy she has tilts the playing field towards other countries at our expense.That’s why she tries to distract us with tired political rhetoric that seeks to label us, divide us, and pull us apart.My campaign is about reaching out to everyone as Americans, and returning to a government that puts the American people first.Here is what an America First economic plan looks like.First, let’s talk tax reform.Taxes are one of the biggest differences in this race.Hillary Clinton – who has spent her career voting for tax increases – plans another massive job-killing $1.3 trillion-dollar tax increase. 9 Her plan would tax many small businesses by almost fifty percent.Recently, at a campaign event, Hillary Clinton short-circuited again – to use a now famous term – when she accidentally told the truth and said she wanted to raise taxes on the middle class.I am proposing an across-the-board income tax reduction, especially for middle-income Americans. This will lead to millions of new good-paying jobs.The rich will pay their fair share, but no one will pay so much that it destroys jobs, or undermines our ability to compete.As part of this reform, we will eliminate the Carried Interest Deduction and other special interest loopholes that have been so good for WallStreet investors, and people like me, but unfair to American workers.Read more: Don’t Go Looking for Trump’s Tax Plan–It’s a Dead LinkTax simplification will be a major feature of the plan.Our current tax code is so burdensome and complex that we waste 9 billion hours a year in tax code compliance. My plan will reduce the current number of brackets from 7 to 3, and dramatically streamline the process. We will work with House Republicans on this plan, using the same brackets they have proposed: 12, 25 and 33 percent. For many American workers, their tax rate will be zero.While we will develop our own set of assumptions and policies, agreeing in some areas but not in others, we will be focused on thesame shared goals and guided by the same shared principles: jobs, growth and opportunity.These reforms will offer the biggest tax revolution since the Reagan Tax Reform, which unleashed years of continued economic growth and job creation.We will Make America Grow Again.In the days ahead, we will provide more details on this plan and how it will help you and your family. It will present a night-and-day contrast to the job-killing, tax-raising, poverty-inducing Obama-Clinton agenda.The State of New York has already lived through Hillary Clinton’s failed leadership. The Washington Post just published a devastating article on Hillary Clinton’s broken promises. She pledged 200,000 jobs for upstate New York as Senator. But what happened? The Washington Post writes, and I quote: “upstate job growth stagnated overall during her tenure, with manufacturing jobs plunging nearly 25 percent…the former first lady was unable to pass big ticket legislation… Many promised jobs never materialized and others migrated to other states as she turned to her first presidential run…data shows that upstate actually lost jobs during Clinton’s first term.”Compare that to my record. In a recent New York Post article by Steve Cuozzo, “How Donald Trump Helped Save New York City,” the paper writes that I — and this is a direct quote — “waded into a landscape of empty Fifth Avenue storefronts, the dust-bowl mugging ground that was Central Park and a Wall Street area seemingly on its last legs as companies moved out…almost by force of will — [he] rode to the rescue. Expressing rare faith in the future, he was instrumental in kickstarting the regeneration of neighborhoods and landmarks almost given up for dead.”This is what I want to do for our country – I want to jumpstart America.Now let’s look at what the Obama-Clinton policies have done nationally.Their policies produced 1.2% growth, the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression, and a doubling of the national debt.There are now 94.3 million Americans outside the labor force. It was 80.5 million when President Obama took office, an increase of nearly 14 million people. The Obama-Clinton agenda of tax, spend and regulate has created a silent nation of jobless Americans.Home ownership is at its lowest rate in 51 years.Nearly 12 million have been added to the food stamp rolls since President Obama took office. Another nearly 7 million Americans were added to the ranks of those in poverty.We have the lowest labor force participation rates in four decades.58 percent of African-American youth are either outside the labor force or not employed.1 in 5 American households do not have a single member in the labor force. These are the real unemployment numbers – the five percent figure is one of the biggest hoaxes in modern politics. Meanwhile, American households are earning more than $4,000 less today than they were sixteen years ago.The average worker today pays 31.5 percent of their wages to income and payroll taxes. On top of that, state and local taxes consume another 10 percent.The United States also has the highest business tax rate among the major industrialized nations of the world, at 35 percent. It’s almost 40 percent when you add in taxes at the state level.In other words, we punish companies for making products in America – but let them ship products into the U.S. tax-free if they move overseas.This is backwards. All of our policies should be geared towards keeping jobs and wealth inside the United States.Read more: ‘President Donald Trump’ In Top Ten Risk Events for Global EconomyUnder my plan, no American company will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes. Small businesses will benefit the most from this plan. Hillary Clinton’s plan will require small business to pay as much as three times more in taxes than what I am proposing, and her onerous regulations will put them totally out of business. 32 I am going to cut regulations massively.Our lower business tax will also end job-killing corporate inversions, and cause trillions in new dollars and wealth to come pouring into our country – and into cities like Detroit. To help unleash this new job creation, we will allow businesses to immediately expense new business investments.No one will gain more from these proposals than low-and-middle income Americans.My plan will also help reduce the cost of childcare by allowing parents to fully deduct the average cost of childcare spending from their taxes.We are also going to bring back trillions of dollars from American businesses that is now parked overseas. 33 Our plan will bring that cash home, applying a 10 percent tax. This money will be re-invested in states like Michigan.Finally, no family will have to pay the death tax. American workers have paid taxes their whole lives, and they should not be taxed again at death – it’s just plain wrong. We will repeal it.Next comes regulatory reformAs with taxes, I will have one overriding goal when it comes to regulation: I want to keep jobs and wealth in America.Motor vehicle manufacturing is one of the most heavily regulated industries in the country. The U.S. economy today is twenty-five percent smaller than it would have been without the surge of regulations since 1980.It is estimated that current overregulation is costing our economy as much as $2 trillion dollars a year – that’s money taken straight out of cities like yours.The federal register is now over 80,000 pages long. As the Wall Street Journal noted, President Obama has issued close to four hundred new major regulations since taking office, each with a cost to the American economy of $100 million or more. In 2015 alone, the Obama Administration unilaterally issued more than 2,000 new regulations – each a hidden tax on American consumers, and a massive lead weight on the American economy.It is time to remove the anchor dragging us down.Upon taking office, I will issue a temporary moratorium on new agency regulations. My running mate, Mike Pence, signed a similar order when he became governor of Indiana. This will give our American companies the certainty they need to reinvest in our community, get cash off of the sidelines, start hiring for new jobs, and expanding businesses.I will also immediately cancel all illegal and overreaching executive orders.Next, I will ask each and every federal agency to prepare a list of all of the regulations they impose on Americans which are not necessary, do not improve public safety, and which needlessly kill jobs. Those regulations will be eliminated.We are in a competition with the world, and I want America to win. When I am president, we will.One of the most important reforms of all is trade reformAs Bernie Sanders has said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgment. 40 We’ve seen this bad judgment overseas, in Libya, Iraq, and Syria. We’ve seen it in Iran. We’ve seen it from President Obama, when he gives $150 billion to Iran, the number one terror state, and even gives them $400 million in money-laundered cash as a ransom payment.But we’ve also seen the terrible Obama-Clinton judgment right here in DetroitHillary Clinton has supported the trade deals stripping this city, and this country, of its jobs and wealth.She supported Bill Clinton’s NAFTA, she supported China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization, she supported the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and she supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Let’s talk about South Korea for a moment, because it so perfectly illustrates the broken promises that have hurt so many American workers.President Obama, and the usual so-called experts who’ve been wrong about every trade deal for decades, predicted that the trade deal with South Korea would increase our exports to South Korea by more than $10 billion – resulting in some 70,000 jobs.Like Hillary Clinton’s broken promises to New York, these pledges all turned out to be false. Instead of creating 70,000 jobs, it has killed nearly 100,000, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Our exports to South Korea haven’t increased at all, but their imports to us have surged more than $15 billion – more than doubling our trade deficit with that country.The next betrayal will be the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Hillary Clinton’s closest friend, Terry McAuliffe, confirmed what I have said on this from the beginning: if sent to the Oval Office, Hillary Clinton will enact the TPP. Guaranteed. Her donors will make sure of it.A vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for TPP – and it’s also a vote for NAFTA.Our annual trade deficit in goods with Mexico has risen from close to zero in 1993 to almost $60 billion. 54 Our total trade deficit in goods hit nearly $800 billion last year.This is a strike at the heart of Michigan, and our nation as a whole.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, before NAFTA went into effect, there were 285,000 auto workers in Michigan. Today, that number is only 160,000.Detroit is still waiting for Hillary Clinton’s apology. I expect Detroit will get that apology right around the same time Hillary Clinton turns over the 33,000 emails she deleted.Hillary Clinton’s Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) will be an even bigger disaster for the auto industry. In fact, Ford Motor Company has announced its opposition to the deal.According to the Economic Policy Institute, the U.S. trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost over 1 million manufacturing jobs in 2015.By far the biggest losses occurred in motor vehicles and parts, which lost nearly 740,000 manufacturing jobs.Michigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of state workforce due to the trade deficit with TPP members.Just imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if the TPP is actually approved. That is why I have announced we will withdraw from the deal before that can ever happen. Hillary Clinton will never withdraw from the TPP. She is bought, controlled and paid-for by her donors and special interests.Because my only interest is the American people, I have previously laid out a detailed 7-point plan for trade reform, available on my website. It includes strong protections against currency manipulation, tariffs against any countries that cheat by unfairly subsidizing their goods, and it includes a renegotiation of NAFTA. If we don’t get a better deal, we will walk away.At the center of my plan is trade enforcement with China. This alone could return millions of jobs into our economy.China is responsible for nearly half of our entire trade deficit. They break the rules in every way imaginable. China engages in illegal export subsidies, prohibited currency manipulation, and rampant theft of intellectual property. They also have no real environmental or labor protections, further undercutting American workers.Just enforcing intellectual property rules alone could save millions of American jobs. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, improved protection of America’s intellectual property in China would produce more than 2 million more jobs right here in the United States.Add to that the saved jobs from cracking down on currency cheating and product dumping, and we will bring trillions of dollars in new wealth and wages back to the United States.Trade has big benefits, and I am in favor of trade. But I want great trade deals for our country that create more jobs and higher wages for American workers. Isolation is not an option, only great and wellcrafted trade deals are.Also critical to our economic renewal will be energy reformThe Obama-Clinton Administration has blocked and destroyed millions of jobs through their anti-energy regulations, while raising the price of electricity for both families and businesses.As a result of recent Obama EPA actions coal-fired power plants across Michigan have either shut down entirely or undergone expensive conversions. The Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs. Hillary Clinton says her plan will “put a lot of coal companies and coal miners out of business.”We will put our coal miners and steel workers back to work. Clinton not only embraces President Obama’s job-killing energy restrictions but wants to expand them, including going after oil and natural gas production that employs some 10 million Americans.According to the Heritage Foundation, by 2030, the Obama-Clinton energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion dollars, and reduce incomes by $7,000 dollars per person.A Trump Administration will end this war on the American worker, and unleash an energy revolution that will bring vast new wealth to our country.According to the Institute for Energy Research, lifting the restrictions on all sources of American energy will:Increase GDP by more than $100 billion dollars annually, add over 500,000 new jobs annually, and increase annual wages by more than $30 billion dollars over the next 7 years;Increase federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion dollars over 4 decades;Increase total economic activity by more than $20 trillion dollars over the next 40 years.The reforms I have outlined today are only the beginningWhen we reform our tax, trade, energy and regulatory policies, we will open a new chapter in American Prosperity.We can use this new wealth to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.As part of this new future, we will also be rolling out proposals to increase choice and reduce cost in childcare, offering much-needed relief to American families. I will unveil my plan on this in the coming weeks that I have been working on with my daughter Ivanka and an incredible team of experts.Likewise, our education reforms will help parents send their kids to a school of their choice.We will also give our police and law enforcement the funds and support they need to restore law and order to this country. Without security, there can be no prosperity. We must have law and order.In the coming days, we will be rolling out plans on all of these items. One of my first acts as President will be to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare, saving another 2 million American jobs.We will also rebuild our military, and get our allies to pay their fair share for the protection we provide – saving us countless more billions to invest in our own country.Read more: Here’s a Factcheck of Hillary Clinton’s Attack on Donald Trump’s Economic PoliciesWe also have a plan, on our website, for a complete reform of the Veterans Health Administration. This is something so desperately needed to make sure our vets are fully supported and get the care they deserve.Detroit – the Motor City – will come roaring back. We will offer a new future, not the same old failed policies of the past.Our party has chosen to make new history by selecting a nominee from outside the rigged and corrupt system.The other party has reached backwards into the past to choose a nominee from yesterday – who offers only the rhetoric of yesterday, and the policies of yesterday.There will be no change under Hillary Clinton – only four more years of Obama.But we are going to look boldly into the future.We will build the next generation of roads, bridges, railways, tunnels, sea ports and airports that our country deserves. American cars will travel the roads, American planes will connect our cities, and American ships will patrol the seas. American steel will send new skyscrapers soaring.We will put new American metal into the spine of this nation. It will be American hands that rebuild this country, and it will be American energy – mined from American sources — that powers this country.It will be American workers who are hired to do the job. Americanism, not globalism, will be our new credo.Our country will reach amazing new heights. All we have to do is stop relying on the tired voices of the past. We can’t fix a rigged system by relying on the people who rigged it in the first place.We can’t solve our problems by relying on the politicians who created them. Only by changing to new leadership, and new solutions, will we get new results.We need to stop believing in politicians, and start believing in America. Before everything great that has ever happened, the doubters have always said it couldn’t be done. America is ready to prove the doubters wrong. They want you to think small. I am asking you to think big.We are ready to dream great things for our country once again.SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT	1.0

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.CROWLEY: Normally, on Sundays, we take a reflective look at the past week and set the agenda for the coming days, but today is no normal Sunday. We are four hours away from a showdown in the House of Representatives, a series of votes that will determine the future of health care reform, impact the economy, influence this November's election and set the stage for the rest of President Obama's agenda. Today is no normal Sunday. Today is game day. I am Candy Crowley and this is State of the Union.This morning, health reform from all angles. Two House leaders, John Larson and Mike Pence, on today's vote. Two senior senators, Dianne Feinstein, and Orrin Hatch, on the week ahead. And analysis from Donna Brazile and Bill Bennett.We have heard the words ""end game"" so many times in this health care debate, I wouldn't try it now. That said, it would in fact be the end if Republicans prevailed in today's vote. For Democrats, the magic number is 216. That's how many yeas needed to pass the health care bill in the House, 216 votes among the 253 Democratic members. It has been a struggle all week to get there. We begin with seven days in two minutes.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)DAVID AXELROD, SR. ADVISER TO THE PRESIDENT: I think we will have the votes.REP. JOHN A. BOEHNER, R-OHIO: If she had 216 votes, this bill would be long gone.PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Hello, Ohio!REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: When we bring the bill to the floor, we will have the votes.REP. JAMES E. CLYBURN, D-S.C., MAJORITY WHIP: We need to get to 216. And we are still tweaking stuff.OBAMA: Your own congressman, who is tireless on behalf of the working people, Dennis Kucinich.ROBERT GIBBS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: It is an important trip that the president will take. And I think he looks forward to it. REP. ERIC CANTOR, R-VA.: I mean, it is clear. They don't have the votes, because the American people can't stand this bill.REP. DENNIS J. KUCINICH, D-OHIO: I've decided to cast a vote in favor of the legislation.GIBBS: That he must postpone his planned visits for a later date.REP. BART STUPAK, D-MICH.: As of today, I am still voting no. Yes, I am still standing with this principle, protecting the sanctity of life. Yes.OBAMA: Hello, George Mason!(UNKNOWN): Yes. I will be voting yes for the bill.PELOSI: Right now, we are just getting votes to pass a bill.OBAMA: And in just a few days, a century-long struggle will culminate in a historic vote.BOEHNER: We are about 24 hours from Armageddon.CROWD: Kill the bill, kill the bill, kill the bill!REP. ANH ""JOSEPH"" CAO, R-LA.: Tomorrow will be a sad day for me as I cast a no vote against something I believe we need.(UNKNOWN): I will be a proud supporter of health care reform.REP. STENY H. HOYER, D-MD., MAJORITY LEADER: Clearly, we believe we have the vote.(UNKNOWN): We feel like we have been pregnant for 17 months. Let's get on with it already.OBAMA: We have been debating health care for decades. It has now been debated for a year. It is in your hands.(END VIDEOTAPE)CROWLEY: Here to look ahead to today's vote and the high stakes politics surrounding it, House Democratic Caucus Chairman, John Larson of Connecticut, and the House Republican Conference Chairman Mike Pence of Indiana. Gentlemen, thank you both for joining me.PENCE: Thank you, Candy.LARSON: Great to be with you, Candy.CROWLEY: State of play, where are you? 216, do you have it locked in?LARSON: This is a historic day. And we are happy warriors. We are so proud of the Democratic caucus, that we will be a part of history, joining Franklin Delano Roosevelt's passage of Social Security, Lyndon Johnson's passage of Medicare, and now Barack Obama's passage of health care reform.CROWLEY: So you have got the 216?LARSON: We've got the votes. And the reason for that, Candy, I think it started earlier this week with Natoma Canfield becoming the poster child for -- or lady for health care reform. And that struck such a cord within our caucus. And Dennis Moore standing up to give a speech in the caucus was Blackberried by a woman who works with him in Kansas. She said thank you for voting for this. I know I am losing my job at the end of this year, and unfortunately, I have just been diagnosed with cancer. Without this bill, I'm lost. Dennis ended by saying, and she is 24. You could have heard a pin drop.This is about whose side you are on. And clearly, this historic moment in the people's chamber, we are on the side of the American people and those that have been denied access to health care, and those who have pre-existing conditions who have been denied, and those who have had their policies rescinded.CROWLEY: Congressman Pence, I think that puts you on the side not of the people, if we take his calculation. What is left for Republicans to do? Congressman Larson says they have the 216. So it is all over but the shouting? You guys vote no and move on?PENCE: Well, I don't know if they have the votes. House Republicans are going to use every means at our disposal.CROWLEY: What is that?PENCE: Well, stay tuned, Candy. It's going to be an interesting day.CROWLEY: Can you disrupt the vote? I mean, what's available?PENCE: We are going to use every means at our disposal to oppose this government takeover of health care. Because quite frankly, as thousands gather at rallies all across this country and here in the nation's capital, yesterday, you know, the American people are sick and tired of runaway federal spending by both parties, of borrowing and bailouts and takeovers. And I believe this is going to be a historic weekend.LARSON: It is.PENCE: But I think it is going to be different from the way John thinks it is going to be. I think this is going to be a historic weekend because I think this weekend is going to be the beginning of the end of business as usual in Washington, D.C. I think the American people see an administration and see a Congress that are in a headlong rush to confront the very real challenges that we have in health care with more government instead of more freedom.They know -- the Republicans have been offering solutions from the beginning. Let people purchase health insurance across state lines, pass malpractice reform, cover preexisting conditions. All of that can be done without a massive, trillion-dollar expansion of the federal government and burdening future generations with more deficits and more debt.CROWLEY: But the reality of this day is that you don't have the votes to stop it. You may have the means to delay it. PENCE: Right. You know, the Republicans, it shouldn't be a news flash to anybody, Republicans don't have the votes to stop anything in the House of Representatives. We are in a decisive minority.CROWLEY: (inaudible) politically.PENCE: But what's remarkable about this one-year debate has proven my point, that a minority in Congress plus the American people equals a majority. Republicans -- the reason they weren't able to do this last year -- remember all the deadlines? We had deadlines in the summer, we had deadlines in the fall, we had deadlines at the end of the year. The American people don't want this government takeover of health care. And I don't know if they have the votes today, but I guarantee you, the American people know they have the votes in America.LARSON: The American people who are already on Medicare, all of our veterans who already receive Tricare, understand the importance and the value of having insurance coverage. For 47 million Americans who have none, 31 million will now be able to have access to insurance, lowering costs, lowering costs for small businesses, lowering the national debt. First, $138 billion, and then $1.2 trillion. We can't afford not to do this. And taking care of those people--(CROSSTALK)CROWLEY: I want to talk about the debt. Hang on one second. I have got to take a small break--(CROSSTALK)CROWLEY: We will come back. I do want to talk about the costs. There are some figures out there floating. I'll do that, we'll be back with Congressmen Larson and Pence right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CROWLEY: We are back with Democratic Congressman John Larson of Connecticut and Republican Congressman Mike Pence of Indiana. We were talking about the cost of this. The CBO has said over 10 years this health care bill will reduce the deficit by $143 billion.However, that doesn't include what might come and what has been promised, with more than a wink and a nod to doctors, which is to up their Medicare payments, their reimbursements, which would cost $208 million, which then means it actually would be -- would add to the deficit.Is that -- is my math correct there? LARSON: Well, if that were to be true. But here is the thing, there is no question about the fact that we need to take care of the docs and we need to emphasize primary care. But also what never gets discussed, Candy, is something that Reuters came out with earlier this year, $700 billion annually in inefficiencies in this system, lack of interoperability in hospitals, lack of a continuum of care, and fraud and abuse -- $700 billion.I think that we're going to -- that's $7 trillion over a 10-year period. I think that we're more than going to be able to wring out the cost in there. I think that's why the president brought people down to Washington, to the White House, that's why he brought the six (ph) in to try to wring out those costs as we go forward.You know, we spend 20 percent of gross domestic product. The closest country to us is Switzerland. I can't believe that we can't get that money out of there.CROWLEY: Can't we get that money out of there?PENCE: Yes, yes, we do such a great job here in Washington wringing out the cost.LARSON: Now that's in the private sector.PENCE: One-point-six trillion dollar deficit this year, you know, only in Washington D.C. could you say with a straight face that you are going to spend $1 trillion and save tax-payers money. Look, you point out the doc fix. This is a total fraud. The Democrats are leaving out $200 billion in spending that the speaker of the house committed again this week to spend, which makes this -- even using this CBO's numbers, it makes it a bill that adds to the deficit in the short term and in the long term.But look, even beyond that, Candy, the American people know that you expand the federal government's role in health care without giving the American people more health care choices by purchasing across state lines, without passing any medical malpractice reform at all -- roughly a third of health care costs in this country I hear are actually defensive medicine driven by junk lawsuits.The American people know this is going to cost more and add more to the deficit, add more to the debt, cost higher taxes even than the rosiest scenarios that are presented...LARSON: The CBO is the bible. The CBO says...CROWLEY: It is, but it's not always accurate, as you know.LARSON: We have arguments with them all of the time, but...CROWLEY: Somebody once told me that predicting...LARSON: ... that's all that we can -- that's all that we can vote on.CROWLEY: Sure, absolutely. But it still is one of those things that we might not find out...PENCE: And the president...CROWLEY: ... except for 10 years from now.LARSON: And the president has put in numerous reforms that are going to take effect, including the inability to rescind your insurance policy, pre-existing conditions. For women across this country, Candy, I mean, there birth is a pre-existing condition, domestic violence is a pre-existing condition, a C-section is a pre- existing condition, in-vitro fertilization, come on.(CROSSTALK)PENCE: My wife had to -- John, my wife had a pre-existing condition. I lost my job about 15 years ago. My wife had a pre- existing condition. She was pregnant with our daughter Audrey. We went to the state guarantee fund, a fund that would be replenished if we passed medical malpractice reform, we could use the savings to strengthen those funds to cover people like my wife was covered.You don't need a government takeover of health care. You don't need to mandate that every American purchase health insurance whether they want it or need it or not, and you don't need to put us on a pathway towards socialized medicine.LARSON: Where is the takeover by the government?PENCE: And that's what this crowd is doing today.LARSON: Where is the takeover by the government? CROWLEY: Let me ask you something, just turn...LARSON: Humana runs Medicare currently. Tricare is run by them. Where is the takeover of government?PENCE: Well, I'll break it down. John, if you mandate that every American purchase health insurance, you mandate that every business provide it...LARSON: Do we mandate that people get car insurance?PENCE: ... you create a...(CROSSTALK)PENCE: ... so that people end up in government-run insurance, and you provide public funding for abortion, you mandate insurance plans, cover it within the exchange...LARSON: There is no funding for abortion in this bill.PENCE: It is a government takeover of health care.LARSON: There is no funding for abortion in this bill. It follows Hyde. That's not -- that's the case. PENCE: John, you know that is not true. The Catholic Church...LARSON: I know it's absolutely true.PENCE: ... the Catholic bishops, the right to life says...LARSON: Sixty thousand nuns can't be wrong.PENCE: ... public funding for abortions is in this bill.LARSON: Thank God for the sisters of Notre Dame, that's what I think.CROWLEY: Let me call a time here, because we are out of time. But for more of this, our audience can tune into the House debate starting this afternoon. And I suspect that pass or not pass, this debate continues as we watch how it goes.LARSON: That's right. Very strong disagreements. But Mike Pence is an honorable man. And I look forward to this debate, and as are our colleagues. I hope that we do ratchet down the conversation though, because when two of our colleagues are spat on and hurled racial slurs, it is time...CROWLEY: It did indeed happen.LARSON: ... it's time to ratchet down things a little bit.PENCE: Well, I'll tell you, I was in Selma with John Lewis, if what is reported to have happened was reported is contemptible, I denounce it in the strongest terms. But I assure you, this debate will not end today.LARSON: I agree with that.CROWLEY: Or probably on this show.LARSON: I agree with that.CROWLEY: Thank you very much, I appreciate it.LARSON: There is going to be a lot of work to go to...CROWLEY: If health care reform wins passage in the House today, the measure heads back to the Senate. Up next, a quick tutorial on what happens next. And then a conversation with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein and Republican Senator Orrin Hatch.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CROWLEY: A quick reality check for those who today's House votes will bring us to the finish line, not quite, not yet. If House Democrats muster the votes today, two things happen. First the Senate version of health care reform will be passed by the House and will then be ready for the president to sign into law. Second, House Democrats will pass a fix-it bill, a companion measure of sorts to correct the things they don't like about the Senate measure. That bill has to go to the Senate. If the Senate goes the easy route, they will pass the fixes without change and send it off to the president. But if the Senate changes anything, if it adds or subtracts from the House measure, it must go back to the House for another vote before it goes to the president.Senate Republicans have some options which could delay or change the bill, including parliamentary challenges to any part of it as unrelated to the budget. Why didn't the ""Schoolhouse Rock"" teach us about this? We will do our best to get answers on what comes next from senators Orrin Hatch and Dianne Feinstein right after the break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CROWLEY: As we explained, even if the health care reform bill wins passage in the House later today, it still has another legislative hurdle to clear, back to the Senate for those changes or fixes, if you will, that House Democrats want.Joining us, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California and Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah.So the other day I noticed, Senator Hatch, that you said it would be nuts for anyone to believe that this is the House's last word on this. You think the Senate will change the fix-it bill that's coming over to you?HATCH: Well, if the rules are followed, they'd have to. Because there is a Social Security component. And you can't do that on reconciliation. There's also an appropriations component as well.So if -- if the parliamentarian upholds that and Joe Biden doesn't overrule the parliamentarian, which would be a first, then it seems to me that it's going to have to be sent back to the House. So anybody that thinks that this is only going to be a one-time deal today in the House, I think, is grossly mistaken.CROWLEY: Senator Feinstein, do you think it's possible for the Senate to take that bill and just go, OK, fine with us?FEINSTEIN: Yes, I do. And I think that's exactly what we'll do. And I really disagree with my friend and colleague. I believe there are at least 51 votes there. I think the bill has been carefully vetted with the parliamentarian. I believe he will stand for each part of it.And the bill that the House passes today goes to the president. He signs it. Then the reconciliation bill comes over to us. We'll probably begin debate on Tuesday. It will be posted -- it takes some time -- begin debate on Tuesday.Now, I'm sure what Senator Hatch's party will do is submit a whole host of amendments. We'll have a major vote-a-thon. And this will go on for several days. And I believe, at the end, more than 51 Democrats will hold firm and will pass the reconciliation bill and we will have health care reform. I can say, for my state, the reconciliation bill is very important. Because we have now 8 million people without any insurance in California. The number has gone up 1 million people a year for the last two years. So this bill is necessary.CROWLEY: Senator Hatch, I want to ask you about the vote-a-thon, but I first want to play something Senator Reid said recently.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. HARRY REID, D-NEV., SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: We're in the last minute of play. The shot clock is turned off. The other side knows what the outcome will be. So they're trying to foul us and foul us and foul us and foul us again, just to keep the clock from reading zero. They're not just delaying the inevitable; they're delaying the imperative.(END VIDEO CLIP)CROWLEY: Are you going on after -- after the shot clock has...(LAUGHTER)I mean, you know, Senator Feinstein calls it a vote-a-thon. I mean, is this the Republican approach to this now, is just to delay the inevitable?HATCH: Well, not really. I think it's to try and get amendments passed that really are valid amendments. I think, if you have a Social Security component in it, it has -- it has to come back to the House. And a parliamentarian has to rule the right way.But who knows? I don't know what the parliamentarian is going to do. All I can say is this. You know, as I walk around this country, and I've been all over the country, people come up to me from everywhere, Democrats, Republicans, saying, we can't afford this; we can't do this. We do not even have solid, final scoring on this.As a matter of fact, the actuary at CMS said he cannot get the final scoring. They also don't include the doc fix in it, which is $371 billion, and that's at present worth. And that doesn't even take care of Medicaid.Of the 31 million people you're going to cover, 16 million are pushed into Medicaid.I mean, let me just tell you, we're coming to a Europeanization of America. And the American people sense it. They feel it. They know that we can't afford this.And, frankly, the doc fix that they have on Medicaid...(CROSSTALK) HATCH: He's a letter -- here's a letter from my governor saying -- now, for two years, they say they'll hold the states free. But then you go off the clip because they cannot afford to pay for it in the federal government.And -- and Medicaid, they're paying -- the doctors are getting 66 percent of what the private sector pays doctors. And they're up in arms. They're not going to take patients now. You can imagine how bad this is going to be if this bill goes through.CROWLEY: Senator Feinstein, do you worry about either unintended consequences or changes in the economy that could, in the end, if this is made into law, really ruin some aspects of health care?FEINSTEIN: Well, of course. This isn't the perfect bill. We all know that.HATCH: Well, that's for sure.FEINSTEIN: We all know that there are going to have to be fixes down the road, just as every major program has had; Medicare has had; Social Security will likely have because of the explosion of costs.Having said that, you have to look at the basics. And the basics are that we pay far more than European nations do for health care. And they have a much better performance.We're about 15 percent; France is 10 percent. And in overall performance by the World Health Organization, France is ranked number one. I think we're ranked 17.We spend a lot of money, but we don't necessarily spend it in the right way or the right places.Now, let me just finish. This bill is really important. Because, if we don't pass it now, you can forget health care reform forever after, I believe. So this is the opportunity. We're right at the goal line. I believe it's going to pass the House. It will be signed by the president. We should pass a reconciliation bill.And I would really appeal to my good friend, Senator Hatch. Let this reconciliation bill get passed. Then, you can see. If it's wrong, you'll certainly say so. If it works, hopefully, you'll say so as well.CROWLEY: And we'll get your answer right after this, because I've got to take a break. And we'll find out if you listened to her appeal, right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CROWLEY: We are back with two top senators, Democrat Dianne Feinstein and Republican Orrin Hatch.When last we met, she was asking if you would just let this reconciliation bill go through and see what happens. FEINSTEIN: Suggesting.(LAUGHTER)HATCH: Well, let me tell you, Republicans are dedicated against this bill. We consider it an awful bill.Do you realize they're going to subsidize families that make over -- families of four that make over $80,000 a year?I mean, we're getting to where 50 percent of the people in this country are going to depend on subsidies. And, of course, I know Dianne can't agree with that or doesn't believe in that.But -- and all I can say is -- is, everywhere I go, people say, how do we pay for this? You know, in all honesty, they have jacked up the costs of Medicare. They're going to take better than $500 billion, now, out of Medicare. They're going to increase taxes by over $500 billion. They're going to sock it to individuals who don't -- who can't afford to buy insurance. They're going to have to pay 2.5 percent of their gross income.Businesses are now going to have to pay up to $3,000 per employee if they don't provide health insurance.You reach a point where you say, who is going to pay for all of this? And it's going to come down to us taxpayers. And like I say, it's the Europeanization of America, and that's the worst thing that could possibly happen to our country.CROWLEY: You -- you said earlier that, of course, there were things that worried you about the bill. If you looked at in the totality, what worries you the most?Is there anything that he says that you think, you know, yes, that is a worry of mine?FEINSTEIN: Well, there -- the bill is a combination of a number of different things designed to cover more people. The bill has very big strong points. For example, right away, there's a $5 billion fund for people with pre-existing conditions who can't get health insurance today.HATCH: We're both for that. We're both for that.FEINSTEIN: That's a very positive thing.HATCH: Sure.FEINSTEIN: So the bill, when really accumulated, the Congressional Budget Office says, will save, over 10 years, $138 billion.Now, Orrin will say, well, it's not this; it's not that; it's not the other thing. But that's the fact that we go on when we assess a bill. CROWLEY: But isn't also true, Senator...FEINSTEIN: So over 10 years, this bill, I'm confident, will not cost more.Now, as I said, are there certain parts that may have to be tweaked, that don't work exactly right? But he has given a litany of complaints about the bill. The thrust of the bill is to provide more people with coverage.One of the good things the bill does is it reduces the nonpremium costs for those 85 percent of people that have medical health insurance. It reduces it from 20 percent to 15 percent so that more money from insurance companies will actually go for medical care. And I think that's important.CROWLEY: Politically, isn't it going to be hard to argue, should this bill pass, and we think it will, just given the numbers, to say, listen, people are now going to be -- not be thrown off their insurance because they got sick. There will be no more caps.FEINSTEIN: Exactly.CROWLEY: There will be help for people down the road, to help subsidize it. How can you argue against that? Isn't that a pretty political powerful package?HATCH: Well, I'm not arguing -- I'm not arguing against that. I think Republicans certainly -- we could agree on a large percentage of things together. But there was really no effort to get us involved.All I can say is this, is that everywhere I go -- and I've said it over and over -- people say, how are you going to pay for this? How do you pay for it?Now, the CMS actuary -- that's the actuary for the administration -- says the cost curve will not be bent, that premiums are going to go up. I have to say that I believe that -- that CBO -- of course they have to decide these budgetary matters based upon the papers given them by the House of Representatives and by the Senate, and those papers are stacked in favor of trying to live within our means, but they don't.The fact is that they double-count in this bill. They have all kinds of other gimmicks in this bill that try to get this bill down to -- everybody knows that this, extrapolated over 10 years, is going to be $2.5 trillion more on top of what we're already spending, $2.4 trillion.You cannot tell me that this country can afford to do that and that we can't find a way, by working together, to really come up with a health care system that will work and work within financial means.CROWLEY: I'm going to give you the last short word. And that is, are you comfortable with the cost of this bill...FEINSTEIN: Yes.CROWLEY: ... and comfortable the country can afford it?FEINSTEIN: Yes. I believe we can. And I believe that will be sorted out over time.I think there's one thing that isn't in the bill, that the president was good enough to take my bill, which would give the secretary of health and human services some control over the rate of premiums to ensure that they are reasonable for people who have private-sector insurance. Unfortunately, the parliamentarian said that could not be added to the reconciliation bill. I have introduced it as a separate bill.I believe this is a huge problem out there. You have Anthem in California and 800,000 policies just jacking up premiums up to 39 percent in California and then saying there may be another increase in the middle of the year.And so people are being pushed off of their health insurance because of the cost of premiums. And this is one thing we need to strengthen, in my view, and hopefully will as a separate piece of legislation.CROWLEY: Senator Dianne Feinstein, Senator Orrin Hatch, I can't thank you both enough for coming. I appreciate it.FEINSTEIN: Thank you.CROWLEY: More of this on the Senate floor next week...FEINSTEIN: Oh, you bet.CROWLEY: ... we promise. (LAUGHTER)FEINSTEIN: Thank you.CROWLEY: Up next, in our ""American Dispatch,"" why, despite the claims of some politicians, it's hard to say exactly how most Americans feel about the health reform bill. And then Donna Brazile and Ben Bennett on the potential fallout for both Democratic and Republican lawmakers up for re-election this fall.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CROWLEY: Our ""American Dispatch"" looks at a central question. What do Americans think?House Republican Leader John Boehner answers for Republicans.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BOEHNER: Because the American people are saying ""Stop,"" and they're screaming at the top of their lungs. (END VIDEO CLIP)CROWLEY: But are they? Two polls released this week leave lots of room for debate. A Pew poll released Thursday asks, ""Do you favor or oppose the current bill?""Only 38 percent said they favor it. So is Minority Leader Boehner right?A Wall Street Journal/NBC poll asks, ""Is it better to pass the Obama plan or keep the current system?""The respondents were split right down the middle.Is it in the way the question is asked? Are more people more likely to support it when it's called the Obama plan or is it that people think some change is better than no change?You be the judge. We will sort through the complicated politics of all this with Donna Brazile and Bill Bennett after a short break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CROWLEY: Joining me here in Washington, two of my favorite people, CNN political contributor and Democratic strategist Donna Brazile and CNN political contributor and host of ""Morning in America,"" Bill Bennett, who is also author of the new book ""A Century Turns."" These authors and stuff, OK.The politics of all this. John Larson, head of the Democratic caucus, says they've got the 216, done deal, goes over to the Senate, Dianne Feinstein all confident they're going to pass it. It's going to be law. How does this all play out politically? I want to play you something the -- two things, actually, the president said yesterday. First, there was this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: I am actually confident -- I've talked to some of you individually -- that it will end up being the smart thing to do politically, because I believe that good policy is good politics.(END VIDEO CLIP)CROWLEY: OK, now, about two minutes later, he had this to say.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: Now, I can't guarantee that this is good politics. Every one of you know your districts better than I do.(END VIDEO CLIP)CROWLEY: So, let's see, I'm thinking we're not really sure how the politics are going to play out. What do you think? BENNETT: Yes, well, as a former teacher of logic, he didn't contradict himself, because he said I believe this will be good politics because it's good policy, but I can't guarantee it. OK, we've heard that before.I think it's bad politics, because I think it's bad policy, and not just from a partisan point of view, but let me just do it analytically. You would not have so many nervous Democrats if this looked like it was really good politics. I don't think it is.And, again, I think, when we see how this plays out, one play will be in November with the midterm elections. Another play, we'll see what happens with budget issues.And since misrepresentations are all over the place in this -- in this proposal, and you look at a state like Massachusetts, which is a state closest to what this federal program is, I think they're going to regret it. Be careful what you wish for, Richard Butler (ph) said, because you may get it.CROWLEY: You know, Donna, what the White House is counting on -- what Democrats are counting on is that, after this is signed into law, people will go, ""Oh, you mean I won't be thrown my"" -- that there will be things in there, and their argument has always been, ""Well, they don't really know what it's in this bill."" Is that going to work?BRAZILE: Well, it's true, Candy, that only 15 percent of voters understand what's inside the bill because we've been talking about the pie crust and not what's in the filling. And I think as soon as they understand that children with pre-existing conditions will not be kicked off their policies, small businesses will have access to an exchange that will help lower their costs and provide better coverage for their employees, I think as soon as they learn the details of this proposal, they will become very comfortable with it.And we all know that the -- that the price that the American people will pay if Congress fails to act is that their premiums will continue to rise $10,000 over the next 15 years. This is good policy, is good politics, it's good for the American people, it's good for the economy. There's no reason for Democrats to run away from this bill.CROWLEY: So you don't think that the Democrats are going to lose seats this November because of the health care bill?BRAZILE: Democrats will lose seats, Republicans will lose seats simply because there are open seats that will no longer go into the Democratic column. They will lose seats...CROWLEY: But not because of health care?BRAZILE: Well, health care, Candy -- and some Democrats might lose because the voters are simply tired of that Democrat and may be tired of Republicans, too. I don't think we should judge this bill based on who will win and who will lose if we're doing what's right for the American people, we're doing what's right for taxpayers. This is a good approach to trying to solve a very longstanding problem in this country.CROWLEY: And that's how the president sold it, right? It was like, don't...BENNETT: Sure.CROWLEY: ... Don't do this on politics. Do this because it's the right thing to do.BENNETT: Look, that's fine. Pericles says courage is the secret of democracy. The president has said something like that, too, do the courageous thing. I think some members of Congress, some Democrats have heard that as, ""Do what my conscience tells me,"" people like Bart Stupak, so we shall -- we shall see.But hold the tape, this tape. Not to be mean, but Democrats will lose seats on this. They will lose a lot of seats. Again, this is what the nervousness is about.Now, if this turns out to surprise me and surprise a lot of people and be profoundly good policy, save the tape for that, too, because I will say to so. But look what happened in Massachusetts. You only had 4 percent uninsured. This thing opened the floodgates. What happens when you nationalize this kind of issue? You have states like Texas and California with 25 percent and 30 percent uninsured. This could bust the budget and really hurt the country.BRAZILE: Well, you know, what's disingenuous about the arguments that the opponents of health care reform will constantly give is that they're worried about the deficit, they're worried about the deficit. Well, if we do nothing, health care will...(CROSSTALK)BRAZILE: ... consume about 20 percent to 25 percent of our GDP. If we do nothing, individuals like myself and others who have individual policies will see their premiums continue to rise.If the Republicans would like to somehow or another defend 39 percent increase in health care costs, children getting kicked off their policies simply because they have asthma, let them go out and defend that. Democrats will defend the substance of this and let the politics play out, you know, in November.BENNETT: Obamacare and doing nothing are not the only options. There are lots of other plans and lots of other ideas fully fleshed out, as Paul Ryan's plan that he wrote with Tom Coburn. This is a plan that never got to see the light of day, never allowed a scoring by CBO. We may revisit it again in the future when we see what this one wreaks.CROWLEY: Is this -- is health care the election issue, or is it really the economy?BRAZILE: It's the economy. It's the economy. It's jobs. It's people feeling secure about their own livelihood. It's the American dream that's at stake. And, look, Paul Ryan had a plan that covered 3 million Americans, reduced the deficit by $30 billion. This is a plan that will cover 32 million additional Americans and reduce the deficit over $138 billion in the next 10 years and, of course, $1.2 trillion over the next 20 years.If this -- this is good policy. Republicans who are concerned about the deficit, like Democrats and independents, should get behind this bill.CROWLEY: Bottom line, Ryan won't pass. Is it...BENNETT: Right.CROWLEY: So it will be this. But is this the election-year issue or is it jobs?BENNETT: It's a big part of it, and jobs is a big part of it, but there's a larger thing, too, which is Washington and distrust of government. And who do they think they are? And don't they know, can't they read that a majority of us said we were opposed to this, we really don't like this?And when the costs start coming in -- and, by the way, when they count the doctor fix, which is going to put this in deficit, they will see it's more cost to the government, more cost to the taxpayer, higher taxes. It's going to cost the Democrats. It's bad policy, bad politics.BRAZILE: Let me -- let me quote -- let me -- let me quote Janet Jackson.CROWLEY: Make it a short quote.BRAZILE: What have you done for me lately? You've done nothing on jobs. You've done nothing on health care. You've done nothing to help fix this economy. The American people like to vote for something, not just against something.BENNETT: Well, they'll have the chance. They'll have the chance. And you will have your way, and the Democrats will rule on this, and probably get it, and then they will own the store.BRAZILE: Well, we're going to still love you, though.BENNETT: Well, I hope so.CROWLEY: The love-fest will continue. And they will be back, I promise you.BENNETT: We'll still be your favorites? We'll still be your favorites?CROWLEY: Still my favorites, I promise.BRAZILE: Thank you.CROWLEY: Ahead, my colleague and former ""State of the Union"" host John King is back here for a Sunday chat about his new show.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CROWLEY: Let's check some of the stories breaking this Sunday.Congressman John Larson said earlier on this program that Democrats have the 216 votes necessary to pass health care reform in the House of Representatives. The vote is scheduled for later this afternoon. Republican Congressman Mike Pence said that his party will use every means at their disposal to oppose the measure.It is a weekend of protests here in Washington. Opponents of the health care reform bill gathered outside the U.S. Capitol Saturday demanding that lawmakers kill the bill.Also yesterday, hundreds held a demonstration to mark the seventh anniversary of the Iraq war.And today, as the House votes on health care reform, thousands are expected to gather here in the nation's capital to call on President Obama and Congress to take up immigration reform.North Dakota's Red River is expected to crest today. Several hundred thousand sandbags have been placed along the river's banks to keep the water at bay. So far, flooding has not been as bad as feared.Two weeks after parliamentary elections in Iraq, the vote remains too close to call. Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki wants a manual recount. He says he's asking for it to preserve the integrity of the electoral process. So far, preliminary results show the prime minister's coalition is leading in seven of Iraq's 18 provinces.And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says his government will not stop building more Jewish settlements in disputed East Jerusalem. Announcement of the move during a recent visit to Israel by Vice President Joe Biden has called a strain in U.S.-Israeli relations. The Obama administration says additional settlements will undermine the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Prime Minister Netanyahu is set to arrive in the U.S. for talks tomorrow.Those are your top stories here on ""State of the Union."" Up next, John King, the man who used to sit in this very room, will be here for a preview of his new 7 p.m. show, ""John King, USA.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CROWLEY: Loyal followers of ""State of the Union"" will want to watch -- in fact, I demand that they watch my colleague, John King's, new broadcast, ""John King, USA."" It premiers tomorrow evening. It's a program with a distinctive look and feel. But this guy, who they're familiar with, let me first -- to start you, though, because you're going to be following this all next week...(CROSSTALK)CROWLEY: We hear -- and probably the week after.KING: And the week after.CROWLEY: John Larson says they got the votes. Do they?KING: Well, one of the deputy whips also said this morning not quite. I believe that -- you know how this works. We will see. Just as they're casting the votes, in the final minutes, there will be three or four people standing in a cluster over here and three or four standing in a cluster over there. They'll be talking to the whips and the leadership sources.And a few of them said, Madam Speaker, if you need me, I'll vote yes, but I'd like to keep my job and I'd prefer to vote no. And so they'll figure it out to the very end. So there -- they would not be doing this if they weren't confident they would get there at the end. There's always a few -- little bit of trading at the end.And then -- and you have had a fascinating discussion about it this morning -- then this becomes a Washington conversation from now to November and, more importantly, an American conversation between now and November. In this midterm election season, you know, sometimes we say this isn't about anything. This is going to be about something huge.CROWLEY: It's amazing, because you really could hear the campaigns revving up, sitting here, because everybody knows this train is -- has left the station and is about to pull up someplace.OK, tell me about the show. I mean, first of all, a whole -- I did watch it online when you did your -- your soft -- what do they call it, soft rollout or whatever that is? Just tell me about it and, like, what the feel is you're going for and what you're hoping to do.KING: On the set, we're trying to be a little bit more relaxed and casual, a little more personal. All my things are on the set. You'll see campaign buttons that I've collected for the last 25 years. You'll see a couple of Fenway Park signs and Red Sox logos. That's who I am.CROWLEY: Surprising.KING: Surprising. But it's like trying to bring somebody in your home or your place in a relaxed way to hopefully have more open and candid conversations. Day-to-day television is a little different from Sunday television. And, you know, I love what you've done with this space on Sunday.And, look, the mission of the program is to do -- take where you start here on Sundays and then project it out in the country. When these guys talk about we're on the side of the American people, let's see if the House and the Senate pass this bill if the American people feel that way between now and November, so we'll go to their communities. We're in their communities this week watching the protests, watching the debates, the phone calls come in to all these offices. We'll do it between now and November. This is one of the things in Washington that can seem like it's an all-Washington confrontation. Health care reform affects everybody; 309 million people in the United States of America will be affected one way or another by this bill, whether they like it or not. So let's cover the big debates here in Washington, but connect them to the impact out in the country. And that's what we're going to try to do.CROWLEY: So when I looked at it online, it really was -- it seems like you're going more for that conversational. It's not your sort of evening news broadcast. Is that the feel of it?KING: I think that's exactly right. It's a news program. It's not a traditional newscast. We want it to be a community and a conversation, not cable conflict, people going at it.If you want to come in -- you can be on the far left and the far right, but come in to have a conversation that is about what's in the bill. Object to the specifics of the policy we're discussing -- discussing, not, say, because you're a D and I'm an R, you're evil and we're just going to yell at each other. Let's come in and let's have a conversation, keep it civil, but it can still be about something.And also we're going to reach out to people who don't live, breathe, eat, and sleep politics in Washington, D.C., but are involved in the process, people who are motivating all those conservatives. Maybe they're tea party people. Maybe they're new faces who are organizing the conservative community.And the same is on the left. As you know, one of the fascinating questions in this campaign, Republicans have the intensity right now, and conservatives -- not always the same thing. Can the left, if they pass this bill -- and that's what a lot of what this is about -- the president trying to say, look, we will lose if we don't get our base back in this election season. One way to try to get them back is to make the tough votes and pass this bill. So that's what we want to track.CROWLEY: ""John King, USA,"" 7 p.m. Eastern tomorrow night. Be sure and watch.KING: Thank you.CROWLEY: We will be there, as well. John and the rest of the best political team on television will also be here this afternoon for today's coverage of the health care vote. And until then, for our international viewers, ""World Report"" is next. For everybody else, ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" starts right now."	1.0
http://www.politifact.com/arizona/statements/2016/jul/27/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-claims-immigrants-are-more-success/	"""Immigrants start businesses at a faster rate; they seem to grow those businesses more successfully.""  "	mtrue	['Immigration']	http://www.vox.com/	http://www.vox.com/a/hillary-clinton-interview#immigration-economy	2016/07/27	"Extreme poverty, welfare reform, and the working poorEzra KleinLet’s start with poverty. Scholars have estimated that the number of American families living in extreme poverty, under $2 in cash income, has skyrocketed in the last 20 years.You have about 1.5 million families and 3 million children in this kind of poverty. Given how many children are now in that condition, should we be following the model of countries — like Sweden, Germany, and now Canada under Trudeau — that have a universal child allowance to cut or eliminate child poverty?This is a policy a lot of countries — including Germany, Sweden, and Ireland — have that pays parents a set amount per month, per kid, no strings attached . Other countries, like the UK and Canada, have a version that phases out for more affluent families. Simulations suggest a US version could cut child poverty by more than half .Hillary ClintonWell, this is a very personal and important issue to me — because, as you know, I started out my work as a lawyer for the Children’s Defense Fund. And I have been focused on child poverty and what we can do to alleviate it for a very long time.I would just slightly amend your question, because we were making progress in the ’90s. We had more people lifted out of poverty. We had a 33 percent increase in African-American family income. We were on the right track. That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t have been looking at more ways to lift more kids out of poverty. But we were on the right trajectory — and, unfortunately, we changed direction.We had policies that I think contributed greatly to the increase in childhood poverty starting in 2001, the Great Recession being the worst of those. But there were also policy decisions, regulatory changes — providing more leeway to the states, so that they did not have either the requirement or the incentive to continue lifting people, particularly kids, out of poverty.Kainaz Amaria/VoxSo we’ve got a big problem, and it’s a problem that’s a reflection on our political as well as our economic systems. And I do think we should focus on how we’re going to support more families, and there are a number of inputs. But trying to create more financial support is something that we should look at. I’m not ready to adopt a plan that comes from some other country, because we have to look to see how we would do anything in our federal system — and how it would be workable and what the cost-benefit analysis might be.But while we’re looking at how we lift incomes — which is the defining economic challenge that we have for working, middle-class, and poor families — we need to do much more to provide the proven interventions in early childhood education that help families, even poor families, know more about how to better prepare their kids. We need to do more with nutrition — and we’re making progress with health care thanks to SCHIP [the State Children’s Health Insurance Program] and the Affordable Care Act.So it’s not just a decision about whether or not to increase the child tax credit or some other means of providing a greater financial safety net. It’s also what we can do to really support families. And I think we have to move on both tracks.Ezra KleinBut to ask a big-picture question about that policy shift: Something a lot of poverty scholars argue to me is that we made a very big change toward trying to support the working poor — welfare reform was, of course, part of that. It went, from the numbers I’ve seen, from bringing a million of these families out of poverty to around 300,000 in more recent years. Then there was the expansion of the EITC.When we say ""welfare reform,"" we’re talking about the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, signed by then-President Bill Clinton. You can read more about its history in Dylan Matthews’s comprehensive explainer .Do you think we do too little now to support the poor who, for whatever reason, cannot find or cannot keep a job?EITC stands for ""earned income tax credit."" It’s effectively a wage subsidy, mostly directed at families with kids, and it’s the biggest refundable credit in the whole tax code. The EITC lifts about 6.2 million people out of poverty , and makes 21.6 million people less poor, every year. Studies show it encourages work, results in major health benefits for mothers and children, and even boosts test scores and earnings for children once they grow up.Hillary ClintonI do. I know there’s a big debate — and it’s an important debate — about welfare reform. Because when welfare reform was passed, there was an expectation — certainly on my part, and I think on the part of many who had supported it — that there would be a requirement that states would have to be contributing to the broadest possible safety net, particularly in economic downturns.So we wouldn’t help the working poor, particularly through the EITC — which I think is one of the best anti-poverty programs that we have devised — at the expense of the poor. We would be providing a continuing safety net for the poor. And that’s one of the programs that I was referring to when I said after 2001, there were a lot of decisions made that basically did not carry on what had been not just the spirit but the requirements in the law, because we had set the base payment at the highest possible rate and expected states to do that.So we are back to a serious problem of poverty, and I think we have to do much more to target federal programs to the poorest, where intergenerational poverty is once again a cycle. Congressman Jim Clyburn has a creative idea called the 10-20-30 approach, where you would put a percentage of federal funds — 10 percent of federal funds — in those communities that are most impoverished and have been for 30 years.So I think we’ve got to address really systemic, generational poverty differently. We still have to lift up working people. We have to make it worth everyone’s while to work. We have to create more good jobs. We still have to have the training pipeline there. But we are now, unfortunately, back having to face poverty that we thought we had a better approach toward ending than it turns out — given the change in administrations and attitudes — that we did.Is it time for more deficit spending?Ezra KleinLet me ask you about how to pay for that. So I looked at the Treasury’s real daily yield curve website today, as I do every morning when I get out of bed. And short-term interest rates on US government debt are negative; they will pay us to take money. That is how much the market wants more US government debt.The Treasury Department sells two kinds of bonds — ones that pay an interest rate tied to the inflation rate, and ones that pay a flat interest rate regardless of inflation. The real yield curve shows the government’s inflation-adjusted cost of borrowing across different time spans.Should we be taking the markets up on this offer of free money? Should we be doing more short-term deficit spending for infrastructure, for poverty, for middle-class tax cuts — and worrying less in the near-term about deficits?Hillary ClintonI think we have missed an opportunity over the last eight years to make some big bets on America — to make some investments with, as you say, money that is as low in terms of interest rates as it’s ever going to be.I have put forth ways of paying for all the investments that I make, because we do have the entitlement issues out there that we can’t ignore. But we are failing to make investments that will make us richer and stronger in the future. And that’s where I think our biggest gap is.I think it’s important that we look for ways to pay for our investments. But I think there can be short-term decisions about the kind of federal dollars that are available now, with a revenue stream to pay them back in the future that would bridge the gap if we can’t do everything we need to do to really give the economy and job creation the kind of boost that it needs.Kainaz Amaria/VoxBut I’m not going to commit myself to that because I would like first to figure out what we’re going to do, because I think we’ve had a period where the gains have gone to the wealthy.The Great Recession wiped out $13 trillion in family wealth. And a lot of people have come back roaring — they are doing better than ever, corporate profits are up, whereas so many Americans are stalled or have fallen backward.Real family income hasn’t moved. In fact, it’s below where it was in 1999 and 2000.So we do have a problem. It’s a real problem. Because we are a 70 percent consumption economy, so we’ve got to get more growth going.And the best way to do that is to invest in these jobs, and I think we can pay for what we need to do through raising taxes on the wealthy and making it clear that there’s a commitment to these investments if we’re going to grow the economy, which will benefit everybody.Ezra KleinI’ve not heard you say it that way before. So part of the argument of doing pay-fors in the near term is not just balancing the budget or reducing the deficit but also bringing distributional fairness to the aftermath of the recession.Hillary ClintonThat’s right. Last summer, I gave two economic speeches which called for strong growth, fair growth, and long-term growth. And I think the three go together.It is important that we look at how they can converge, because I do believe we’ve got to grow the economy. I’m an economic growth Democrat, so I believe that.But we also have to make it fairer, and part of the way we make it fairer is by shifting some of the tax burden onto those who have done really well despite all of the macro- and microeconomic ups and downs in the global economy and here at home. And that’s why the Buffett Rule; that’s why a fair share surcharge on incomes above $5 million; that’s why closing the loopholes, like the carried interest loophole.It’s not just a symbolic effort to say, ""Hey, we gotta get rid of the gimmicks and the games."" It’s also to get money to do what we need to do to lift the bottom and the middle up. And it is a way of making clear that growth and fairness have to go together.Would more immigration be good for the economy?Ezra KleinI think it’s probably an understatement at this point to say that immigration has been a big part of this year’s campaign. We talk a lot about the roughly 11 million unauthorized immigrants who are already here. And I know you’re supportive of comprehensive immigration reform.But there’s a broader question around immigration and the economy: The economic data I’ve seen suggests pretty straightforwardly that immigrants are good for the US economy, particularly as the population ages.The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Senate’s 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill, which would have modestly expanded immigration, would have increased America’s real GDP by 3.3 percent in 2023 and 5.4 percent in 2033. It’s less clear what the effect of radically expanding immigration to the US would be, but some economists estimate that opening borders around the world would double global GDP .So do you think it’d be good for the economy to double or triple the number of people who could come here legally?Hillary ClintonI think we have to deal with first things first. It is certainly the case that immigration has been and continues to be good for our economy. Immigrants start businesses at a faster rate; they seem to grow those businesses more successfully; they do fill certain gaps in skills and knowledge that are good for the overall economy.But I think there are three big problems we have to address. One is just the human cost of those 11 million undocumented immigrants. I have met many of them — in fact, we all have, whether we acknowledge it or not. And these are hardworking people. These are people who are already contributing to the economy, whose children are in schools, who are really absolutely committed to the American dream.The little girl I met in Las Vegas who is living in fear that her parents are going to be deported, she’s got stomachaches and all kinds of physical ailments. And she should be a kid and she should be enjoying school and learning and deciding what she’s going to do. So I do think we have to be very understanding and accepting of the human stories that are behind these statistics that people like Donald Trump throw around.I think also, though, there’s a lot of evidence that moving toward comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship would be good for our economy. We already know that undocumented workers are putting about $12 billion into the Social Security trust fund with no anticipation at this point that they’ll ever get anything out. They’re paying payroll taxes; they’re paying other forms of taxes — state and local as well as federal.So we do have a productive part of our economy, and most of the analysts that I have seen suggest that this idea of deporting everybody would be a severe blow to the economy. That it would cost millions of jobs, that it would depress economic growth. There’s a moral, humanitarian kind of ""American values"" argument, and there’s an economic argument.I think it would be very difficult to do anything on immigration until we make the decision that there will be comprehensive immigration reform. Because otherwise we are mixing up a lot of the concerns about immigration in a way that I think will hurt both the immigrants who fill jobs we need, particularly high-value jobs, and the people who are here living in fear that someone’s going to round them up and deport them.Kainaz Amaria/VoxI think we have to look at all of these issues. Comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship would deal with a lot of these concerns, not just the 11 million people here: how we would regularize them, what kind of steps they’d have to go through. Because I believe they do have to meet certain standards if they’re going to be on a path to citizenship.But I don’t want to mix that with other kinds of changes in visas and other concerns that particularly high-value technical companies have. In fact, I think keeping the pressure on them helps us resolve the bigger problem, and then we can look to see what else, if anything, can and should be done.But I would also add one of the biggest complaints I hear around the country is how callous and insensitive American corporations have become to American workers who have skills that are ones that should make them employable. The many stories of people training their replacements from some foreign country are heartbreaking, and it is obviously a cost-cutting measure to be able to pay people less than you would pay an American worker.I think it’s also a very unfair and sad commentary that we don’t want to invest in training American workers because that’s just ""time-consuming."" And it’s a cost — so even if they could do what we’re wanting them to do, it’s just easier to get someone who will be largely compliant because they want to stay in the country. And that’s just wrong.So there’s work we have to do on all sides of the immigration debate, and I want to see companies have to do more to employ already qualified Americans.Ezra KleinWhy do you think it is that it is so intuitive to people, or so intuitive to many people, that there is a zero-sum competition with immigrants for jobs? As you said, that’s not what the economic evidence shows, but it’s powering a lot of politics in this country.Economists disagree about a lot of the details of immigration, but they uniformly agree that it raises per capita national income by allowing for a more efficient allocation of workers to jobs. Even skeptical economists like George Borjas concede that immigration increases economic growth and that some of the benefits go to natives. More pro-immigration researchers like Giovanni Peri argue that most immigrants complement, rather than substitute for, native-born workers, so even less-skilled natives you might expect to lose out from immigration end up fine.Hillary ClintonI think it’s because everybody with six degrees of separation either knows or thinks they know someone who knows somebody who lost a job to an undocumented worker or to a worker brought over on a visa to do their job. There’s just a lot of churn that suggests this is a real problem.Now, the argument that I have been making is: Look, part of the reason why Americans are agitated about immigration is because they do believe their jobs are being taken out from under them — and there is an unlevel playing field — because if you are employing undocumented workers, and no one is holding you accountable — which we haven’t, we haven’t enforced those laws in a very comprehensive way — then it’s easy to undercut the market. To say, ""Hey, roofer, come down, I’m substituting this man for you. Goodbye. Thank you very much. Here’s your last paycheck."" Because the man they’re putting up there will cost maybe as little as a tenth of the price as the guy who was on the roof.So I think it’s real. It’s hard to argue an economic, analytics abstraction — that really it’s not that much job displacement; and, you know, the overall economy is better; and they’re making these investments in Social Security trust funds — it’s really hard when you’re the one who has lost the job. When you are at Disney in Orlando and you’re told to retrain your successors and then kicked out the door. Or when you’re on a construction site, and all of a sudden you show up the next morning and they tell you they don’t need you anymore because they’ve picked up a bunch of folks at a job corner in the neighborhood. So there’s enough real-world experience that gives people the anxiety that we’re seeing in the political environment.Is it a big job displacement? No. But is it something? Yes. Is it something that is painful and personally hurtful to somebody you know, maybe not you but someone down the line? Absolutely. And I think it’s a mistake to just make the economic argument.I think it’s important that we see the undocumented as people with real stories, with kids who are going to school, with people working 70 to 80 hours a week to have a good life. But it’s also important we see the other side of the story, with people who feel doubly hammered. They feel hammered by global competition, particularly from China taking their jobs, and then they feel hammered from within by employers who are willing to hire undocumented workers and never get held accountable for it.The difficulties of free college and universal health careEzra KleinDuring the debates with Sen. Sanders, you guys clashed on free college. And you made the argument that you did not want to be subsidizing the tuition of Donald Trump’s children, and fair enough.During the primary, both Clinton and Bernie Sanders proposed that the federal government start helping states subsidize colleges. Sanders called for free tuition for all students, while Clinton wanted tuition that students can pay without student loans. Since this interview, Clinton has announced that she wants to make tuition completely free for students from families making less than $125,000 per year.But that argument could also be made on public elementary school, on public high school, on public libraries. So how do you think about when a policy should be universal in nature and when it should be specifically targeted at the needy?Hillary ClintonI think about that in the following way: We have always had a mixed public-private higher education system. And although we do have private schools within elementary and secondary education, they have not been as big a factor as private higher education has been.So what we’re really talking about already is a hybrid system. Because even Sen. Sanders is not talking about subsidizing private higher education. And I think that’s a significant difference. The cost of higher education has always been an individual family responsibility aided by scholarships, grants, work-study programs — the whole mix of ways we enable people to go to college.But we don’t pretend we’re going to do anything for those who choose a private college. Now we let the GI Bill go to either public or private schools; we let Pell Grants go to public or private schools. So we do help to subsidize individuals at private colleges or universities, but we have never taken the position that there is no difference between the two of them. Just like we have a big fight in federal and state legislatures about: Will we subsidize private elementary and secondary education? And with very few exceptions, the answer has been no. That we do believe in the importance of a public education system, so we have adopted these approaches.I had several concerns about Sen. Sanders’s program. I thought it was hard to justify claiming it was free when it was going to have to be paid for by state governments, by a lot of state governments — up to a third of the cost — that were not particularly well-known for supporting higher education. They’ve in fact been disinvesting. And I think it’s more important that we incentivize reinvestment in public higher education.Kainaz Amaria/VoxSo rather than holding out the promise of free college — which wasn’t really free; it was going to be paid for by state and federal dollars — I think it’s important that we say: We’re going to subsidize as far as we can responsibly go. But we’re going to expect states to reinvest in higher education. And I know the arguments that have been made, and [Sanders] was an eloquent advocate for the argument that it should be like Social Security. It never has been; it’s not how we view it; and it would be incredibly expensive to do that as he had proposed. And even he relied on states which had been disinvesting, and we need to reverse that so they start investing.So I want to go as high up the income scale as I can to make sure that middle-class, working, and poor families don’t have to borrow money to go to college. But I don’t want to add the cost of subsidizing me, or subsidizing Donald Trump, at this point. I don’t think that’s a sensible way for us to approach this.Ezra KleinTo ask about another interesting fissure from the primary: You often said that your preference was that we built on Obamacare to get to true universal coverage. And I’ve read your plan around Obamacare, and it doesn’t do that yet. So what would be your approach for taking that program from the roughly 90 percent covered that it’s at now to 100 percent?Hillary ClintonWell, let’s celebrate that we’re at 90 percent coverage. And I think that is one of the differences: I see the glass at 90 percent full, not empty. And [I believe in not] starting over again — either by repealing it, as the Republicans advocate, or by coming up with a whole new plan.So I think it’s tremendous. There was a new Robert Wood Johnson study that pointed out that just in the five years since it’s been implemented, health care spending has gone down $2.6 trillion from the projection that they originally thought it would increase by.So we are really making progress, and I think it is important to build on that progress. We have 20 million people who are now in the Affordable Care system. We’ve expanded Medicaid, which I want to see expanded in every state that hasn’t, because I think that was an ideological rather than economic or moral decision. And I want us to build on the Affordable Care Act.Kainaz Amaria/VoxNow, how are we going to do that? We’re going to have to be clear about the competition that is needed to keep costs more reasonable. It is going to require us to take a hard look at premiums, copays, deductibles, and see what we can do to limit the kind of additional costs — particularly for prescription drugs — that policyholders have under the exchanges.We have got to encourage more competition. Not just by working with the existing insurers but really trying to open the door — more successfully than was achieved — to other forms of insurance. The cooperative insurance plan hasn’t worked in most places, but it’s worked in some places. What are the lessons we can learn from that?So I’m actually very excited about this, and I think we will get to 100 percent coverage. And I think we will do it by building on people spending their own dollars and by our subsidies.And it is a much more acceptable, less disruptive approach than starting over and trying to impose a single-payer system — because, remember, the vast majority of Americans are getting their health insurance through their employment. There’s very little evidence they are unsatisfied by it. I certainly saw that firsthand when I was working on this back in ’93 and ’94. And I favor a public option so we can try to lower the costs even further for people who have a larger risk of bad health problems.Ezra KleinShould that public option be able to link with Medicare to bargain down prices?The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that a public option would cut Obamacare's price by $158 billion over a decade, by offering consumers a nonprofit health plan with lower premiums.Hillary ClintonI think it’s going to be something we’ll have to look at. I have long been in favor of giving Medicare the authority to bargain. And I voted for it; I’ve spoken out for it—Ezra KleinYou mean on prescription drugs?Hillary ClintonOn prescription drugs. And if it were to be a broader public option, maybe there as well. Because it is clear that we don’t have enough bargaining power yet to deal with some of the big cost drivers, like prescription drugs, that are still not reacting the way we had hoped that they would.In fact, there’s a lot of new gimmicks to try to drive up the cost of prescription drugs. But I’m actually optimistic. I think we’re on the right track with the Affordable Care Act. And of course we’re going to have to make adjustments. We did with every other program that people now defend and love, and we're going to do it with the Affordable Care Act.What skills does a president need that campaigns don’t test?Ezra KleinWe’ve talked about a number of policies here — but not so much about how to get them done. What are the qualities you think you possess that are needed for an effective presidency that aren’t rewarded or revealed by the campaign trail?Hillary ClintonWell, I think a lot of governing is the slow, hard boring of hard boards. I don’t think there’s anything sexy, exciting, or headline-grabbing about it. I think it is getting up every day, building the relationships, finding whatever sliver of common ground you can occupy, never, ever giving up in continuing to reach out even to people who are sworn political partisan adversaries.I’ve seen it work. I’ve seen it work. And I’ve been part of seeing it and making it work. I really believe there’s no shortcut; there’s no quick answer. Now, if there’s a major national disaster — like the Great Recession — you could get things done that you couldn’t otherwise. And you have to seize those moments, and I think President Obama did that.But I think you’ve got to try to push forward as many different issues as you can all at the same time, because you never know what’s going to turn the tide. So I just think it’s getting up every day and working on it. It is not flashy, and you don’t telegraph everything you’re doing, because that would be breaching the relationship and the negotiation that you may be involved in.I certainly saw my husband do it, and he did it with people who were trying to destroy him. Every single day, he’d meet with them at night; they’d hammer out deals; they would negotiate over very difficult things; they’d shut the government down; he’d veto them; they’d come back. You just keep going.Because we’re dealing with a hyperpartisan opposition who has decided their ideology is more important than actually getting results — either for their constituents or for their country. They really have put ideology above everything else. I don’t know all the reasons — I’m going to wait for a smart political scientist to explain it all to me — but it makes the negotiating harder.Back in the ’90s, after criticizing Bill all day, Newt Gingrich would come over to the White House at 9 o’clock and they’d negotiate for a couple of hours.And certainly with the work that I did on the Children’s Health Insurance Program and the work I did as a senator — I worked with people who were very much political opponents, but we found that common ground. And the same as secretary of state. I had to round up, I think, 13 Republicans to pass the New START treaty. And you just keep working at it. It takes a lot of effort, but if you’re persistent you can get things done.Ezra KleinThe background for that is a real structural rise in partisanship and division. Barack Obama is the most polarizing president since we began polling; before him, it was George Bush; before him, Bill Clinton.Both you and Donald Trump begin as the least favorably viewed major party nominees since we began polling. What do you think are the background drivers of the higher polarization, higher bitterness, that seems to afflict politicians of both parties now?Hillary ClintonI think there are a number of factors. Again, I’m not sure I totally understand it all. The media environment — particularly the social media environment — drives negativity. It’s what captures eyeballs. It’s what gets people to tune in or log on. It is just human nature.Saying something negative about somebody, whether it was a negative ad 30 years ago or a negative tweet or other allegations today — there’s just a really rich environment for that to capture people’s minds and change their attitudes.There’s a lot of behavioral science that if you attack someone endlessly — even if none of what you say is true — the very fact of attacking that person raises doubts and creates a negative perspective. As someone Exhibit A on that — since it has been a long time that I’ve been in that position — I get that. I get it.And it’s always amusing to me that when I have a job, I have really high approval ratings; when I’m actually doing the work, I get reelected with 67 percent of the vote running for reelection in the Senate. When I’m secretary of state, I have [a] 66 percent approval rating.And then I seek a job, I run for a job, and all of the discredited negativity comes out again, and all of these arguments and attacks start up. So it seems to be part of the political climate now that is just going to have to be dealt with.But I am really confident that I can break through that and I can continue to build an electoral victory in November. And then once I’m doing the job, we’ll be back to people viewing me as the person doing the job instead of the person seeking the job.Look, I’m not making any special plea, because it’s just reality. But every recent study has shown that if you take all of the media and all of the Republicans and all of the independent expenditures, tens of millions of dollars of negative attacks have been run against me. And that’s just something I’ve learned to live with, and I don’t pay a lot of attention to it anymore.Ezra KleinDo you think you get pulled along that slipstream? I think here of the debate when you say you were proud of having Republicans as enemies.During a Democratic debate in October , Clinton said that the person or group she’s proudest to have as an enemy is ""probably the Republicans.""Do you think part of this environment has put you in a place of feeding it and running more negative campaigns?Hillary ClintonNot very much. I mean, you can go back and look at how I’ve worked with Republicans, and I think I have a very strong base of relationships with them and evidence of that. But, you know, they say terrible things about me, much worse than anything I’ve ever said about them. That just seems to be part of the political back and forth now — to appeal to your base, to appeal to the ideologues who support you.We have become so divided, and we’ve got to try to get people back listening to each other and trying to roll up our sleeves and solve these problems that we face, and I think we can do that.What’s on Hillary’s bookshelf?Ezra KleinI know we have to let you go, and I’ll ask you this one final question. What are three books that have influenced how you think about policy that you think everyone should read?Hillary ClintonOh, my gosh, there are so many I’ve read over the years. I wrote one called It Takes a Village, which I highly recommend—Ezra KleinYou can’t plug your own book.Kainaz Amaria/VoxHillary Clinton[Laughs] I think there’s a lot of wisdom in Bob Putnam’s latest book, Our Kids. I think there’s a really great story that he tells about going back to the town he grew up in outside of Cleveland, where kids of all different backgrounds, economic family standing, and they’re all together and everyone was in it together. And there was so little distinction, and there was so much economic integration in that small town.Now he goes back to it, and it’s so divided. It’s divided on income; it’s divided on race; it’s just a very different environment. And winners and losers are preordained at a very early age. So I think that’s a book that people should read right now.I think that a lot of Christopher Lasch’s work and Alan Wolfe’s work and Habits of the Heart — that wonderful old sociological work that was led by Robert Bellah — are also really helpful. Because we need to be reminded of what is unique about the American experience. De Tocqueville saw it. Habits of the Heart came from his writings, and you can see how more difficult it is in a 24/7, 360-degree media environment to find the time to think, to breathe, to spend relaxation hours getting to know people.We just don’t do that. We don’t build relationships; we don't, on the Republican-Democratic divide in Washington, spend any time with each other — even less than what I did when I was there, and that wasn’t that long ago. So I think looking at writings both by political scientists and sociologists about how America worked well and trying to sort through what did we lose that has made it so hard for people to even listen to each other.And I do think — and I keep saying this, because I believe it — I think the media environment where people are rewarded for being outrageous, for yelling at each other, for saying things that are untrue without being held accountable for it has contributed to this attitude of divisiveness and separation. And I regret that.I think people — maybe it’s not the media’s role to say, ""Well, wait a minute, that’s just not right."" I mean, it was shocking when CNN fact-checked some of Donald Trump’s sayings the other day. But it’s hard for the average viewer or listener to do that himself, and there is no guide any longer. It’s just not easy to sort out what you’re being told.And if people are being addressed in their fear — as opposed to their openness, their tolerance, their hopefulness — it just creates an even more hardened view about whether we can work with each other or not. And I worry about that; I worry it is undermining our democracy.A democracy relies on the glue of trust. You don’t have to agree with me. But I do have to believe, whether it’s an economic transaction or my vote, that there’s a certain expectation. That, yeah, there are people who go off the rails — everybody’s not what they pretend to be, we all know that. But in general, there’s got to be that rock-solid belief that this transaction between us as voters and citizens rests on something deep and sacred. And I don’t know how we get back to that.Why America stopped trusting elites — and what elites should do about itEzra KleinThe invocation of trust there I think is really interesting. You bring up the media. We are one of many institutions that the public, if you look at the polling, has lost trust in tremendously over the last 50 years. They’ve lost trust in their politicians; they’ve lost trust in business; they’ve lost trust in the media.So when you say that there are gatekeepers who should fact-check — and at Vox, we do a lot of fact-checking — but one issue is that people don’t listen anymore. Why do you think there’s been such a systemic loss of trust across so many different institutions all at once? How do you explain that change in America?Hillary ClintonWell, because I really believe that none of us has done what we should have done in being really straightforward about what we know and what we don’t know. And being willing to say, ""We reported that story last week; it turns out we were wrong."" Or, ""We didn’t tell you everything you might have needed to make a decision.""I’ve argued with network executives for 25 years that somebody is going to really figure out that running a news program where you actually say, ""Hey, we got that wrong,"" or, ""I’m not so sure what he just said was right, and I don’t think it is and let me tell you why, and here’s the evidence to that effect."" [A program] where someone is trying to pull the curtain back, as opposed to everyone going back to their corners, whether it’s ratings or whether it’s an ideological position — that’s really what we’re about.As opposed to, ""We have a really solemn responsibility, and we’re going to level with you. You may not like what you hear, but we’re going to try to the best of our ability not to get it wrong. And when we do, we’re going to be the first to tell you.""I think politicians — look at the nonsense that people say running for office, just ridiculous stuff, and they get away with it because there’s no big gong that rings; ""Oh, my God, look what so-and-so just said."" But there should be some reward for trying to get it right and for trying to correct it when you get it wrong. And maybe it’s just too threatening — whether you’re in politics, business, media, wherever you are — maybe it’s too threatening to admit that.I don’t know how we’re going to rebuild the trust, because it really starts with saying, ""Hey, I made a mistake,"" or, ""I didn’t get it right,"" or, ""Hey, I’ve got more information, and let me tell you,"" and just doing it in a very matter-of-fact way.Kainaz Amaria/VoxCreditsDirector: Joe Posner; Camera: Carlos Waters, Julia Wall; Stills photographer: Kainaz Amaria; Gaffer: Paul Lowery; Studio operations: Andrew Scott Willis, Sarah Bishop; Editors: Laura McGann, Sarah Kliff, Susannah Locke, Allison Rockey, Kay Steiger; Video editing & animation: Joe Posner; Developers: Yuri Victor, Ryan Mark; Designers: Sanette Tanaka, Tyson Whiting; Charts: Javier Zarracina; Project managers: Susannah Locke, Katie O’Dowd; Transcription: Jeff Stein; Transcript annotations: Sarah Kliff, Dara Lind, Dylan Matthews, Libby Nelson, Andrew Prokop, Jeff Stein, Matthew Yglesias; Copy editor: Tanya Pai; QA: Jon Douglas, Nancy Seay.All images made in Raleigh, North Carolina on June 22.A Vox Media Storytelling Studio collaboration"	1.0

The online petitions — created on the We the People platform at petitions.whitehouse.gov — are required to receive 25,000 signatures in 30 days for the White House to respond. The Texas petition, created Nov. 9 by a man identified as Micah H. of Arlington, had received more than 116,000 signatures by Friday. It asks the Obama administration to “peacefully grant” the withdrawal of Texas, and describes doing so as “practically feasible,” given the state’s large economy. Residents in other states, including Alabama, Florida, Colorado, Louisiana and Oklahoma, have submitted similar petitions, though none have received as many signatures as the one from Texas. A White House official said every petition that crossed the signature threshold would be reviewed and would receive a response, though it was unclear precisely when Micah H. would receive his answer.

Rick Perry, who twice made public remarks in 2009 suggesting that he was sympathetic to the secessionist cause, will not be signing the petition. “Governor Perry believes in the greatness of our union, and nothing should be done to change it,” a spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, said in a statement. The secession movement in Texas is divergent, with differences in goals and tactics. One group, the Republic of Texas, says that secession is unnecessary because, it claims, Texas is an independent nation that was illegally annexed by the United States in 1845. (The group’s leader and other followers waged a weeklong standoff with the Texas Rangers in 1997 that left one of its members dead.) Mr. Kilgore, the candidate who is changing his middle name, said he had not signed the White House petition because he did not believe that Texans needed to ask Washington for permission to leave. “Our economy is about 30 percent larger than that of Australia,” said Mr. Kilgore, 48, a telecommunications contractor. Few of the public calls for secession have addressed the messy details, like what would happen to the state’s many federal courthouses, prisons, military bases and parklands. No one has said what would become of Kevin Patteson, the director of the state’s Office of State-Federal Relations, and no one has asked the Texas residents who received tens of millions of dollars in federal aid after destructive wildfires last year for their thoughts on the subject. But all the secession talk has intrigued liberals as well. Caleb M. of Austin started his own petition on the White House Web site. He asked the federal government to allow Austin to withdraw from Texas and remain part of the United States, “in the event that Texas is successful in the current bid to secede.” It had more than 8,000 signatures as of Friday. A version of this article appears in print on November 24, 2012, on Page A12 of the New York edition with the headline: With Stickers, a Petition and Even a Middle Name, Secession Fever Hits Texas.	1.0

Kagan has apparently wanted to be a judge or justice since adolescence (she posed in judicial robes for her high school yearbook). There was a brief period, in her early 20s, when she expressed opinions on legal and political matters. But that seems to have ended pretty quickly. She has become a legal scholar without the interest scholars normally have in the contest of ideas. She’s shown relatively little interest in coming up with new theories or influencing public debate. Her publication record is scant and carefully nonideological. She has published five scholarly review articles, mostly on administrative law and the First Amendment. These articles were mostly on technical and procedural issues. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

In 2005, for example, she delivered a lecture on women and the legal profession. If ever there was a hot-button issue, it’s the mommy wars, the tension between professional success and family pressures. Kagan deftly summarized some of the research showing that while women do well in law school, they are not as likely to rise to senior positions at major firms. But she didn’t exactly take a stand. “What I hope to do is start a conversation,” she said. Kagan’s sole display of passion came during her defense of her decision to reinstate a policy that banned the military from using Harvard Law School’s main career office for recruiting. But even here, she argues that her position was not the product of any broad opinions. She was upholding the antidiscrimination regulations of Harvard University. She told the Senate in written answers to questions during her confirmation hearings for solicitor general, “The position I took does not entail a view on the exclusion of R.O.T.C. from college campuses, and I never expressed a position on the exclusion of R.O.T.C. What we have is a person whose career has dovetailed with the incentives presented by the confirmation system, a system that punishes creativity and rewards caginess. Arguments are already being made for and against her nomination, but most of this is speculation because she has been too careful to let her actual positions leak out. There’s about to be a backlash against the Ivy League lock on the court. I have to confess my first impression of Kagan is a lot like my first impression of many Organization Kids. She seems to be smart, impressive and honest — and in her willingness to suppress so much of her mind for the sake of her career, kind of disturbing.

I'm Christiane Amanpour. Andat the top of the news this week, trouble on the road to recovery. Jobless claims are up. (UNKNOWN): The numbers are dismal for employment. AMANPOUR: And Wall Street gets nervous. How worried should we be? And what will bring confidence back? This morning, top voices on theeconomy: former New Jersey Governor and Wall Street CEO Jon Corzine;Republican Senator Bob Corker of the Senate Banking Committee; Obamaeconomic adviser Laura Tyson; and chief economist at the U.S. Chamber ofPlaynullCommerce, Martin Regalia. Then, washed away. Twenty million Pakistanis in danger, as theworst flooding in memory leaves huge areas of the country under water. It's a race against time to bring relief. ""This Week"" has the latestfrom inside the crisis, with U.S. efforts to deliver aid. Plus this week, the president weighs in, defending the mosque andIslamic center near Ground Zero. OBAMA: Muslims have a right to practice their religion, as everyoneelse in this country. AMANPOUR: Or does he? Playnull OBAMA: I will not comment on the wisdom of making a decision to puta mosque there. AMANPOUR: That and all the week's news and politics on ourroundtable, with Cokie Roberts, political strategist Matthew Dowd, DavidIgnatius of the Washington Post, and Chrystia Freeland of Thomson Reuters. And the Sunday funnies. LENO: Unemployment among teenagers at an all-time high, all aroundthe world. It's not just here. In fact, in China, it is so bad, kidsas old as seven are having to move back in with their parents. (END VIDEO CLIP)ANNOUNCER: From all across our world to the heart of our nation'scapital, ABC ""This Week"" with Christiane Amanpour starts now. AMANPOUR: Good morning. This was supposed to be the summer ofrecovery, but the effects of the so-called Great Recession continue tocloud this nation and much of the world. The number of U.S. workersseeking unemployment benefits rose unexpectedly to 484,000. It's theworst in almost six months. And in the housing sector, banks foreclosedon more than 90,000 properties in July, the second-highest total sincethe crisis began. And these pictures speak to the desperation this week in Atlanta. Thirty thousand people waited for hours in sweltering heat to apply for655 available spots of government-subsidized housing. And I'm joined by four top voices on the economy. From Berkeley,California, member of the president's Economic Recovery Advisory BoardLaura Tyson. From Chattanooga, Tennessee, Republican Senator Bob Corkerof the Banking Committee. In New York, the former New Jersey governorand CEO of MF Global, Jon Corzine. And joining us here in Washington,chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Martin Regalia. Thank you all for joining me. You've heard the figures. You'veread about the figures. You can also probably palpably feel the concernand worry amongst the American people. And I want to read you somethingthat was written about this joblessness, about the younger generation inthe Atlantic recently. Look at what was written about unemployment. ""There is unemployment -- a brief and relatively routinetransitional state that results from the rise and fall of companies inany economy, and there is unemployment -- chronic, all-consuming. Theformer is a necessary lubricant in any engine of economic growth. Thelatter is a pestilence that slowly eats away at people, families, and,if it spreads widely enough, the fabric of society. Indeed, historysuggests that this is perhaps society's most noxious ill."" Let me turn to you right now, Martin Regalia. Do you agree withthat? And do you think that that's what this country is in right now? REGALIA: Well, I agree with it, and I think that is what we'reseeing right now. We're seeing an economy that is growing, but growingin a very lackluster way. It's not generating enough demand, andtherefore it's not generating enough jobs. And on top of that, the last three or four recessions have givenrise to longer terms of unemployment. More retooling is necessary tobring the displaced workers back into the workforce, and that retoolingis taking a lot longer. AMANPOUR: Let me turn to you, Laura Tyson. You're an adviser tothe president right now. A recent Wall Street Journal poll of some 53economists say they don't see the employment rate coming down below 9percent, you know, at least until June 2011. What can be done about this? TYSON: Well, I think that we have to do a number of things. Ithink we have to worry, first of all, about taking care of the peoplewho are unemployed. And that's why I really have supported theextension of unemployment benefits and the extension of benefits to helppeople maintain their health insurance if they lose their job, very,very important. You have to deal with the reality that people arelong-term unemployed, 7 million people long-term unemployed. Secondly, we have to continue to do everything we can to stimulatedemand in the economy. Let me give you two examples. We do have apayroll tax credit that has been offered to companies that bring on newunemployed workers into the workforce. I think we should continue that. I think we should continue to look at major spending oninfrastructure projects. You know, the good news here about thestimulus, it's said, well, the infrastructure projects haven't come onboard yet. They're coming on board now, and they have highjob-per-dollar-spent outcomes. AMANPOUR: All right. TYSON: And then, finally, we have to worry about the longer-runproblem of this structural employment, because I'm going to point outone thing for this discussion. The unemployment problem is primarily aproblem for people who have a high school -- who don't have a highschool education or just have a high school education. Unemployment for those with college educations is now 4.5 percent. Unemployment for those with more than a college education, below 4percent. We have a problem of education in this country, and we have toeducate more of our young people fully through college education. Let'stake this as an opportunity to do that. AMANPOUR: Let me ask Senator Corker on the Banking Committee -- andyou've spoken quite a lot about this -- you are in Chattanooga rightnow, and you told me that you have been out in the rural areas, wherethere's really nothing for people out there. You know, beyond -- beyond the current unemployment rate, there'salso underemployment, and it's standing at about 16.5 percent, the totalproblem of people who either don't have a job or who don't have enoughof a job to make ends meet. How is it -- is it impacting the people inthe rural areas? And do you think that this really goes to the heart ofthe American dream that is being deferred? CORKER: Well, you know, as we speak, the city that I'm sitting inhas been named one of the -- is named the top economic producer over thenext decade, and it's because of investment in the workforce. It's avision. It's the fact that we really have held on to trying to producethings. As you go to the rural areas, with the lack of infrastructure thatexists in most rural areas around our country, there's lesseropportunity for that. And so it does create challenges that don't existin some of the major metropolitan areas, and I think we're seeing thatmore and more across our country. At the same time, I think much of what we've done over this lastyear is create an air of unpredictability. And what's happening isbusinesses are sitting on the sideline. They don't know exactly whatthe lay of the land is. And I think the best thing we can do inWashington at this time is really just to calm down and quit changingsweeping -- making sweeping changes. I sat down with a business this week -- I'll give you an example --and they're looking at the health care bill, and they're trying todecide, should they keep people under 30 hours? Smaller businesses aresaying, should we stay under 25? So I think that much of what we've done over this last year hasactually been counterproductive. And, again, the best thing we can dois just calm down, to really let people's balance sheets sort of getback where they need to be. That will stimulate demand over time, asfamilies and people -- households across our country get their balancesheets in order. AMANPOUR: Well, we'll come back to that. You know, the FinancialTimes has basically said that Congress needs to, quote, ""get a grip."" I'm going to ask you about that right after I go to Governor Corzine andask him about what is going to stimulate the kind of consumer confidencethat you were just talking about, Senator -- Senator Corker. Look, there are figures, Governor Corzine, that suggest thatnon-financial companies have socked away something like $1.84 trillionin cash and other assets, but they're not spending them, they're nothiring, they're not building plants and other infrastructure. Why not? And wouldn't -- don't they have a responsibility to do so in this situation? CORZINE: Well, there is a gap of confidence in the economy thatcomes from the shock that we had of 2008 and 2009; $17 trillion worth oflost economic value in that timeframe makes companies and people very,very concerned. Even though we've had a major recovery in some of thatvaluation loss, it makes people nervous. We also -- and I think your quote that you started with actuallyframes what is the real problem. We have both a recession problem thatwas the result of the great financial crisis, but we also have thisgreat transformation that's taking place across the globe. A lot ofother countries are very competitive with the United States today, andwe need to invest in our education system, in our infrastructure system,in our efforts to expand our exports, if we're going to be competitiveas we go forward. AMANPOUR: OK, well, let me ask -- let me ask about that, becausewhen it comes to exports in manufacturing, we read quite a lot thatAmerica has been losing its competitive edge to places like China and --and -- and other such. Laura, what do you think the United States cando to regenerate a competitive export in manufacturing? TYSON: Well, I think the key word Jon raised is investment. And Ithink it is absolutely essential. You know, we get caught up indiscussions of deficit reduction or stimulus. Let's forget those issuesfor a minute and just think about investment. And here it is investment in a number of things. I've heard SenatorCorker talk about the importance of infrastructure. For years goinginto the Great Recession, it has been noted that the U.S. has beeninvesting inadequately in its infrastructure, maybe to the tune of $200billion a year of economically justifiable investment infrastructureswe're not doing. Let me turn to investment in education. It is the case -- we usedto be number one in the world in college graduation rates. We are nownumber 14, number 15. We're leading the world in high school dropoutrates. And as I said, the unemployment problem is most severe in dropouts. So invest in people. Invest in infrastructure. Invest inknowledge. You know, we basically are trying to get the research anddevelopment spending in this country up to 3 percent so we can again beleaders in the world in that. Invest, invest, invest is really what wemust do. Public-private partnerships, you know, with that, $100 billion ofthe stimulus package is levered to private spending. A dollar spent bythe public sector on infrastructure can bring three dollars of privatespending. AMANPOUR: So, Martin Regalia, why isn't the private sectorinvesting, investing, investing? REGALIA: Well, I think, you know, our tax laws and our otherregulatory structure in Washington don't foster that. We tax savingsmultiple times. We don't allow full cost recovery. We don't allowexpensing on investment. We can't even pass an R&D credit extensionthat's been delayed for over a year through a Congress that's fightingwith each other. And when you don't have the kind of laws and the kind of taxstructure that facilitate and encourage investment, you get a lot lessof it. We tax our multinational corporations on their overseas profit. We're the only major trading country in the OECD that still does that,that doesn't have a territorially tax system. And so what do we do? We tell our people, go out and export, andthen we tell them, we're going to tax you more than every other peopleyou have to compete with in the global economy. AMANPOUR: Senator Corker, what about that? We were talking aboutCongress, and you just heard Mr. Regalia talking about Congress fightingwith each other and not getting these things done. What do you thinkcan be done? You said chill out, calm down, perhaps until after theelection. What can be done to fix this, do you think, in a bipartisan way? CORKER: Well, I think one of the things we need to do -- I've heardLaura talking about investment -- is as a country, we need to decide,how much should the federal government spend? On average, it's been20.3 percent over the last 50 years. I heard Erskine Bowles the otherday say 21 percent. But I think much of our debate goes to littleissues that really divide our country, but that needs to be the firstissue. How much should the federal government take in from the privatesector? Once that decision is made -- I might say 18 percent. Erskine maysay 21 percent. Maybe the right number is someplace in between. Butafter that decision is made, what is the appropriate tax policy togenerate economic growth? And I think that some comments have been made about our lack of --the way we tax. We do tax investment. We encourage people to go intodebt. I think our tax policy in this country certainly needs to belooked at, and it needs to be looked at in a way to encourageinvestment, to encourage growth. Obviously, if our gross domestic product grows, then the whole issueof debt diminishes, the kind of things that Laura's talking about aremore able to be done. So I think we -- we need to move to that bigpicture first, look at what's appropriate. I think most people inAmerica would rather determine what to do with their own money versuslet 535 people decide for them. But the fact is that -- that we get mired down in these littleissues that divide us when really we ought to focus as a country on thisbigger issue first. AMANPOUR: So let me go to you, Governor Corzine. You lost anelection -- re-election in your state when you were governor. When youtook office, unemployment was at 4.7 percent. When you left, it was 9.9percent. Is that why you lost? And you've talked about how it waspainful, but in 20/20 hindsight, what could you have learnt from that,do you think? CORZINE: Well, I think that any time the economy is weak,incumbents are going to have challenging re-election on most instances,and that certainly was the case when you have unemployment rise thatmuch. We were in the midst of the financial meltdown and theaftershocks of that in 2009. I think we'll see some of that this fall. But I want to go back to, we have been successful in this country indriving investment with higher tax rates than what we have today. Ithink the issue about setting those and making sure that the expiringtax cuts that are actually on the table at the end of this year, thatneeds to get addressed, and it needs to get addressed relativelyquickly, because that does create uncertainty while that is yet to beresolved. I would hope that the Congress and the president would either say,""We're going to get to a conclusion about the long term,"" or, ""We'regoing to extend this for a year and we'll come back and debate this atanother point in time,"" because that's a major uncertainty overhangingthe economy. AMANPOUR: Let me... CORZINE: In the long run, though, we overemphasize taxes relativeto the general confidence and the well-being of our middle class. Thatcomes together, and you'll see it in the elections. If you have thathigh unemployment rate extending over a period of time, people are goingto be mighty unhappy, and they're going to take it out on both Democratsand Republicans. AMANPOUR: Let me just quickly go to what you've mentioned aboutbeing competitive with the rest of the world. The big story out ofEurope this weekend is that Germany has shown a stronger-than-expectedgrowth over the last quarter. Laura, you were saying something about how Germany had -- had taughtand trained its workforce to compete in these situations. TYSON: Right. Well, Germany has had a long-term commitment tomanufacturing. And it has a very strong manufacturing base. It has amuch larger share of its economy in manufacturing than we do. A major part of that is (inaudible) serious vocational training andvery serious ongoing training for manufacturing workers in Germany. Andoftentimes a German firm with German workers will retrain and usetechnology at home rather than offshore those jobs abroad. AMANPOUR: All right. TYSON: And I want to point out, also, that Germany manages to dothis with a much higher tax rate than we do. I think there should becorporate tax reform. I agree with what -- a lot of what Senator Corkerand Martin Regalia have said, but we need investment. And I would say, in thinking about the share of government and GDP,something that the senator mentioned, we need to distinguish betweeninvestment spending by the government -- whether it's federal, state orlocal -- and other spending. AMANPOUR: OK. TYSON: A dollar spent for infrastructure is different than a dollarspent for current operations of government. AMANPOUR: All right. We've got about 30 seconds left. I want toknow, do you think, Martin Regalia -- and then Senator Corker -- cansome confidence be injected into the American consumer anytime soon? REGALIA: Yes, I think it can. I think one thing that we have toaddress right away is, what's going to happen at the end of the yearwith the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts? There ought to be an extension, atleast a temporary extension, and that would help to -- to ease both theconsumers' fears and the business fears. AMANPOUR: Senator Corker, 15 seconds. CORKER: Yes, I agree with that. Let's -- let's leave tax policy asit is. Mark Zandi had a great piece today in the New York Times sayingthe same. Let's not fiddle any more. Let's leave it -- let's leavethings so they're predictable and deal with -- deal with this down the road. AMANPOUR: Well, we'll see how that plays out ahead of the electionsand afterwards. Thank you all for joining us on this important topic. CORKER: Thank you. AMANPOUR: And we turn now to Pakistan, a major U.S. ally, where amajor humanitarian crisis in its third week. Pakistan's government saysthe worst flooding in that nation's history has left 20 million peoplehomeless. U.S. military helicopters are providing a lifeline for manythere, but the U.N. says that 6 million people are in need of food,water and shelter. ABC's Jim Sciutto flew into Pakistan's Swat Valley with a U.S. Armyrelief mission. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)SCIUTTO (voice-over): From the air, the scale of the disaster isalarming, rivers swollen miles beyond their banks, behind them, a trailof destruction. (UNKNOWN): I've never seen such a large area receive as much damageas I have seen in Swat. SCIUTTO: Flying into the hard-hit Swat Valley aboard U.S. Armyrelief helicopters, we saw every single bridge destroyed, and on theground, villages now dependent on aid from the air. In Bahrain, population 40,000, its once waterfront hotels now in thewater. It has no power, no clean water, and no roads in or out. (on-screen): So it's cut on both sides? (UNKNOWN): Yes, it's gone on both sides. SCIUTTO: So this is -- this is an island now? (UNKNOWN): (OFF-MIKE) is an island. SCIUTTO: These American helicopters are ferrying supplies frombases like this one to villages that are completely cut off. We'reseeing rice and flour and other supplies going in. The helicopters aretoday their only lifeline. (voice-over): Food, much of it from the U.S., in, refugees out. For the fight crews diverted to relief from combat in Afghanistan, it isa dramatic shift. (UNKNOWN): I sat down and spoke to all the troops about turningthat switch off. But the first time I looked at those children needinghelp, I was no longer concerned. SCIUTTO: U.S. and Pakistani relief teams are fighting against theclock. This weekend, the first confirmed cases of cholera, apotentially deadly disease that's the result of the lack of cleandrinking water. For many Pakistanis, the flooding and its aftermath is a grittyreminder of all the ways the government has failed them, a ploddingresponse, a state budget dependent on fallen loans, shoddyinfrastructure. Seeking to take advantage of the chaos, the Taliban isdelivering help where the government is not, particularly in Swat, whichsaw the end of a massive anti-militant offensive just weeks ago. For the U.S., however, one sign of hope. America is deeplyunpopular here, but the relief effort is winning hearts and minds. Among them, the mayor of Bahrain, who told me the U.S. is outdoingPakistan's Muslim allies. (UNKNOWN): And in this disaster, the Islamic countries give theiraid after America. SCIUTTO (on-screen): Does that surprise you? (UNKNOWN): Yes, surprise, surprise. SCIUTTO: A good surprise? (UNKNOWN): Good surprise, yes. (END VIDEOTAPE)SCIUTTO: The first priority of the American relief effort is tohelp the millions in need, but U.S. officials will say very openly it'salso intended to improve America's dismal image here. Sixty-eightpercent of Pakistanis view the U.S. negatively, and the sight of thoseAmerican helicopters a very tangible form of outreach. And, Christiane, on a lot of that food going in, we've seen themlabeled very prominently with American flags. AMANPOUR: Jim, indeed. Let's just talk a little bit more aboutthat, because you mentioned the disapproval rate because of the dronestrikes, because of going after terrorists that kill quite a lot ofcivilians. How are you noticing that in these areas Americans areactually being received warmly because of this aid? SCIUTTO: Well, we see them getting hugged. They're getting kissesliterally on the ground from these troops and thanks, gratitude for thisaid that they're in desperate need of. That said, nationally, the Pakistani media is not covering the U.S. relief effort very closely. They're focusing -- perhaps notsurprisingly -- on the Pakistani relief effort. And in a sign of thesensitivity of simply being associated with the U.S., the U.S. will notidentify local Pakistani NGOs that it's giving aid to so it doesn't openup the risk that they're subject -- that they're targeted for terrorattacks. AMANPOUR: And, Jim, very quickly, the Pakistani troops, are theybeing diverted from fighting the militants? SCIUTTO: Well, there are 50,000 Pakistani troops involved in thisrelief effort. Pakistani officials say that none of them have beendiverted from the border or from counterterror operations. And U.S. officials that we've spoken to today say they believe thosereassurances. And they say, Christiane, that counterterror operationswith the Pakistanis are underway as we speak. AMANPOUR: Jim, thanks so much, from Islamabad. And in response to my questions on the disaster, you can seecomments from U.S. Special Representative to Afghanistan and PakistanRichard Holbrooke on our Web site at abcnews.com/thisweek. And coming up next, the president's decision to weigh in on thecontroversial Islamic center near Ground Zero on our roundtable withCokie Roberts, Matthew Dowd, David Ignatius, and Chrystia Freeland. ENDABC News ""This Week with Christiane Amanpour""Roundtable: Cokie Roberts, Matthew Dowd, David Ignatius, Chrystia FreelandSunday August 15 2010 (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(UNKNOWN): How is that healing, by building a mosque, anin-your-face mosque at Ground Zero? (UNKNOWN): It's like spraying swastikas all over a Jewish memorial. BLOOMBERG: We would be untrue to the best part of ourselves and whowe are as New Yorkers and Americans if we said no to a mosque in lowerManhattan. KING: This is such a sensitive issue. This, to me, is such a wrongplace to have a mosque such as this. OBAMA: I believe that Muslims have the right to practice theirreligion, as everyone else in this country. That includes the right tobuild a place of worship and a community center on private property inlower Manhattan in accordance with local laws and ordinances. (END VIDEO CLIP)AMANPOUR: The president waded into the controversy over the Islamiccenter near Ground Zero, one of the topics that we'll be discussing thismorning in our roundtable, with political strategist Matthew Dowd,Chrystia Freeland of Thomson Reuters, David Ignatius of the WashingtonPost, and our own Cokie Roberts. George Will is still on vacation. Thank you all for joining us. You did see that speech by thepresident on Friday night at the Iftar Ramadan dinner at the WhiteHouse. Why do you think he said that then? ROBERTS: I think he said that then because he actually believesthat, but the real question is, why that he didn't say the next daysomething more? Do you want to talk about that? AMANPOUR: Yes, we do, because we're going to put up some pollnumbers and just show everybody what the poll numbers are on thisissue. One poll says, when they ask about what people think about theplan to build the mosque, that only 30 percent say it's appropriate and64 percent say it's wrong, but when they say do the Muslim group have aright to build the mosque, 61 percent say yes and 34 percent say no. So I guess, is that, do you think, what caused the backtracking? Although those poll numbers were out before the speech on Friday night. Listen to what the president said in the gulf in Florida on Saturday,yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: I was not commenting and I will not comment on the wisdom ofmaking a decision to put a mosque there. I was commenting veryspecifically on the right that people have that dates back to ourfounding. That's what our country is about. (END VIDEO CLIP)ROBERTS: That's really not what he was doing. I mean, if youlisten -- as you played the whole first part of what he said -- he saidthey have a right to build on private property, all of that, and --granted, he didn't say it's wise to build on private property, but itwas very clearly an endorsement. And then to walk back from it is justso silly. He's already taken all the flack for having said it. DOWD: I think they figured out this is a real political problemthey have. And I think they either had a tin ear at the beginning ofthis and how it was going to come across or they mishandled it totallyfrom the beginning, because if they understood, I think, the public onthis, where two-thirds of the public say they have a right buttwo-thirds of the public say don't do it, he would have given a speechgoing directly to those points, instead of saying -- one day saying theyhave the right and the next day saying I didn't necessarily say it wasthe right thing to do. I think this is a big problem for the president, because it feeds abroader narrative about him, which is, it's my way or the highway. Inmany ways, to me, it reminds me of Bush, which is, is, ""I don't carewhere the American public is on this. I'm going to say what I think isthe right thing to do."" He did on -- he's done it on immigration in Arizona. He's done iton this. He's done it on health care. I think that's the politicalproblem... (CROSSTALK)IGNATIUS: ... problem for him. I thought that the speech Fridaynight was a model of political courage, in the sense that he said whathe believed knowing that it was going to cost him. The White House hasstayed out of this issue knowing that it's political poison, and I thinkthe president spoke to it fairly directly. This is America. Peoplehave a right to build on property that they own, even if it's going tobe a mosque near Ground Zero. He said -- I was sort of sorry that he was trying to walk it back inthese more nuanced comments yesterday. FREELAND: I totally agree with David. And I think, you know, Matt,too, the point of my way or the highway, another way of talking aboutthat is leadership, conviction, having your beliefs, and not governingaccording to polls. And I think if you asked most Americans, what kind of a leader doyou want, if you ask people in the world what kind of a leader, you wantsomeone who governs according to conviction. And I do think this touches on, Christiane, the economic panel thatyou had earlier. I think that it touches on it in two important ways. This point about private property might seem like a parsing, but it isactually essential. And I think to have the president -- and we had similar commentsfrom Mike Bloomberg coming out and saying, actually, we believe that therights of private property are so strong, we are not going to changethem because -- because... (CROSSTALK)AMANPOUR: But there are two issues, Cokie. Where does this go fromnow? I mean, where does it actually go? Is this now a line drawn underit? ROBERTS: No. AMANPOUR: Is this... ROBERTS: No, I think that... (CROSSTALK)AMANPOUR: ... to get built? ROBERTS: Well, that's -- that's an issue that I certainly can'tanswer, but I -- my guess is, eventually it does get built and that itbecomes no problem. But the -- but the political issue will continue, because eventhough the president's remarks Friday night started a firestorm, I thinkthe backtracking is even worse, because, you know, you can make a casethat what he said Friday night is just a matter of fact, it is anAmerican right, but to keep -- to keep saying, well, now I'm not sureabout this, and then what tomorrow is like... (CROSSTALK)AMANPOUR: ... I just want to ask you, because it does go to theheart of what he's been doing since the beginning of his presidency,reaching out to the -- not just the Muslim world, but to Muslims ingeneral. And he made a very important first interview, where he saidthe United States could not afford to have yet another generation ofMuslims viewing it as the enemy. So do you think it's wise to have this huge hubbub over it or itshould just go forward, this mosque? DOWD: Well, he would -- the president would like this to sort ofjust go away and not have a huge hubbub about this. The problem is, isthat two-thirds of the country are opposed to him on this. That's aproblem for a president of the United States. I think he is in totally -- he states what's in the Constitution. They have a right to build it. That's not the point in this. That isnot the point in this. You have a right for free speech. It doesn'tmean that you can go and like yell... (CROSSTALK)IGNATIUS: Standing up for free speech for Muslims is -- is a pointin this climate. FREELAND: Where is that not the point? DOWD: But it -- it -- the point is, is that you have to buildconsensus on this. Tolerance goes two ways. Tolerance goes two ways. Tolerance is the tolerance to somebody to build on private property whatthey want, but tolerance also is to recognize what that symbolicallysays to a whole bunch of people in this country. And if you don'trecognize that, you're going to have this kind of furor. AMANPOUR: Do you think it should go ahead? DOWD: Do I think it should go ahead? No. I think he should calltogether the people -- there's many Muslims and many people in the Arabcommunity that are very worried about this happening, actually, thatthey voiced in there. I think he or somebody should call together something, put this onhold for a little while, bring together some consensus about what peopleshould do, because right now, it's white hot. AMANPOUR: But what do you do then? It is white hot -- you'reabsolutely right -- right now. But what do you do when the actualowners, the people who want to build this are in the moderate stream ofMuslims, did go to the White House? You were there when they did, when-- when this gentleman did, condemned 9/11, condemned extremism,condemned terrorism, and now they're faced with this situation? ROBERTS: Well, there are -- there are ways always of making thesesituations just less hot. And it is a question of suggesting otherplaces, providing other places. Those kinds of things can always beworked out. FREELAND: But let's talk a little bit about the rest of the world. You know, I think that actually the president's comments, the commentsby Mike Bloomberg are a really important message to the Muslim world. And we're going to be talking about Pakistan later on. For thesepeople, for American leaders to say, in the space of, you know, somepolitical pressure from their voters, to say, actually, we believesufficiently strongly in diversity, in private property rights for ourAmerican citizens, I think that's a great... (CROSSTALK)IGNATIUS: ... our strongest -- our strongest suits. ROBERTS: ... coming back from it is the problem. IGNATIUS: As the world looks at us, if they see that the UnitedStates -- even in -- you know, an issue that hurts -- and Ground Zerohurts -- even on that issue, we still stand up for the freedom of peopleto dispose of their property as they want, that does count. When I travel, you travel, Christiane, you know, we hear commentsabout that America a lot. And I think you shouldn't minimize thebenefits of -- of saying to moderate Muslims, ""Here you are. Thisupsets a lot of Americans, but we're""... (CROSSTALK)FREELAND: ... if the people you're being tolerant of... (CROSSTALK)DOWD: There's two freedoms in conflict here. There's two freedomsin conflict. There's the freedom to build on your private property andthen the freedom for people to protest and say this is not what we want. IGNATIUS: Understood. DOWD: I think the president obviously has to lead in this countryand lead in the world. The problem with this one is he is speaking froma position of weakness, not a position of strength. And so if he doesnot have consensus... AMANPOUR: Why do you say that? DOWD: He is in a total position -- his approval numbers in thiscountry are in the low 40s. He's perceived as not able to handle allthe major issues in this country right now. The vast majority of thiscountry right now questions his leadership. For him to go out on an issue like this that is white hot and thensay, ""I'm going to say it, and I'm going to lead the rest of the world,""while two-thirds of this country is in another place, is a real problemfor him. AMANPOUR: So, clearly, the consensus appears that it should havebeen arranged, debated, done in a slightly better way between those whowanted to actually build it and the community, whether they're Jewishmembers of the community, Christians, or other Muslims. And one of the tragedies seems to me that the actual imam wastalking -- and his wife -- to the -- to the people who put up the Jewishcommunity center in New York and was talking about how to have somethingsimilar like that. And it seems to have all gone awry. Let's move on to politics, because this week was also -- and this is(inaudible) was primary week in -- in -- in many states. Some have saida group of sort of -- political playbook said oddball character iscoming out of right field. What -- whether you believe or agree withthat or not -- do you think is the effect of those who've won in someareas, the Tea Party candidates, those who supported? DOWD: Well, it's interesting. ABC, I think over the last couple ofmonths, has done a great job of sort of gauging the frustration thatexists in this country, and it's high as it was in 1992, as high as it'sbeen in 2008. It's not just limited to Republicans. It's independentsand some Democrats in this. I think these primaries have shown that there are some places whereit's real anger that's related to frustration and then it's other placeswhich a majority (ph) which is related to frustration. I think the Republican Party right now, it is the comparison betweena bonfire there and a campfire in the Democratic primary. So you canhandle the campfire, but the bonfire, which is what helped elect TeaParty people and what's gone on across just headed into November. I think this is perilous for both parties, actually. I think it'sperilous for the Republicans if they become the Tea Party folks, whichare sort of out of the mainstream and are going to have a hard timewinning November elections, but it's also perilous, I think, for theDemocrats if they ignore this level of frustration and they don't dealwith it. ROBERTS: That's right. They -- now, they've had plenty of time tolearn about it, and they've had town meetings and heard about it and allthat, so they're not going to be taken by surprise. But they think thatthey can just go back to the old playbook, so they're pulling out SocialSecurity, and they're running against George Bush, and they're doingthings that have worked for them in the past that I'm not at all surewill work for them this year, and that could be a real problem, becausethey're not understanding the level of frustration. IGNATIUS: The Democrats sound this year with this president likethe party of the establishment. And we have a political firestorm outin the country. People are really angry. They're angry at Washington. They're angry about the economy. The Tea Party is an expression ofthat, but what Robert Gibbs, the president's press secretary, wascalling the professional left is another example of that, people whojust are angry at the mainstream, centrist views the president often hasbeen espousing. And I think that's a real problem for them. They don't have theenergy. They're not tapping into this energy source as they headtowards the elections. FREELAND: Well, doesn't it just all come down to the economy? ROBERTS: Well, sure. Sure. FREELAND: I mean, you know, I don't want to be too simplistic, butwith unemployment at nearly 10 percent, I thought the comments that JonCorzine made earlier were right on, that this is a double whammy, thisis a recession following a financial crisis, and this is also the finalact of America's structural adjustment to globalization and thetechnology revolution. That's a really big deal. And I think the real problem is not --you know, we're going to be focused a lot on messaging and cosmeticsahead of the midterms. The real question is, can an American politicalparty or political movement come up with a powerful economic plan, andone that is maybe really different? And we're seeing that happen in other countries. Look at Britain. David Cameron's Tories won with a really radical plan, and they gotactually... (CROSSTALK)IGNATIUS: ... just doesn't work. I mean, it's not like they didn'thave a plan. DOWD: Republicans don't really have to come up with anything overthe next 90 days. ROBERTS: No, that's right. DOWD: They're going to win a huge amount of seats in the House, ahuge amount of seats in the Senate. They're going to win a bunch ofgovernors' races. To me, the economy is representative of a bigger issue that's outthere. I agree the economy is the number-one issue. The problem is, ispeople out there do not think Washington is listening to them. Theydon't think they're paying attention to what's going on in America. And the reason why the economy is so -- has so much anger in it isbecause people don't think they're being empathetic with where they arein their life. And that's, I think, a problem. ROBERTS: But they're also -- you know, the voters were also veryambivalent themselves, because on the one hand, the furious... (CROSSTALK)ROBERTS: Right, exactly. They're furious with Washington for beingfurious and for everybody fighting with each other and why doesn'tanything work, and yet they're furious and feed into that partisanshiptremendously so that there's no right answer for the politicians as theygo to face the voters. AMANPOUR: But also these primaries this week, the White House andDemocrats were saying that it's not such a bad bag. We (inaudible)comfort from some of the results there. ROBERTS: Well, because they were able to re-nominate Michael Bennetin Colorado, and that made them feel good, because they had backed him. But, you know, Newt Gingrich had backed Nathan Deal in Georgia, too, andhe won against Sarah Palin's candidate. So, you know... (CROSSTALK)AMANPOUR: What does that say about the sort of star of the TeaParty movement? DOWD: Well, I mean, endorsements always to me are questionableanyway, because the voters ultimately make the decision. I think stillSarah Palin -- Sarah Palin on the Republican side has the most energyand emotion and passion behind her than any other candidate. She canstill walk into a city and get 3,000, 5,000 people. No one can dothat. So she can have that emotionally. She can charge that, andultimately it's about her. I think the interesting thing on the results is that, there's thisbig wave coming into Washington, and Democrats have a seawall. Andwhat's happened now is Republicans have nominated people that may not beable to win. And so basically the Republicans are putting bricks on topof the seawall and building it higher, that they're going to have lesschance of winning in this election because of who they've nominated insome of these places. IGNATIUS: You know, their biggest problem would be... ROBERTS: Working on that seawall. IGNATIUS: ... I suspect, if they -- if they did win. Suppose theRepublicans did win control of the House and the Senate. What wouldthey do? What would their program be? You know, they'd be a mucheasier mark for the Democrats heading toward the 2012 presidentialelection. You almost think it would be better for Obama... (CROSSTALK)ROBERTS: Well, of course it would be better for Obama. FREELAND: You can try to triangulate... (CROSSTALK)DOWD: ... 2012 if the Republicans took one of the branches, becausethey could either do one of two things which would be beneficial tohim. He could compromise and then show him, he's going to buildbridges, or he could just say, ""They're the problem, they're the problem."" The fear I think the White House has is he's going to get the worstpossible result, which is a small margin in the House, a small margin inthe Senate, he can't get anything done, but he owns all the levers ofgovernment... (CROSSTALK)AMANPOUR: So now that we've settled that one, let's move right outof the country to Pakistan briefly, because we did talk about it withJim Sciutto, but it's been likened to their Katrina. The U.S. is doingthe right thing sending relief, right? ROBERTS: Yes, sure. DOWD: Yes, absolutely. AMANPOUR: Politically, economically. ROBERTS: Absolutely. AMANPOUR: How... ROBERTS: Humanitarian. AMANPOUR: Humanitarian, of course... FREELAND: Strategically. AMANPOUR: Exactly. What do you think, though, when you look atthis, here's the fight, here's Pakistan nuclear-armed, here's Pakistanhaving done the right thing, to an extent, having sent its army afterthe militants, and all of that, all of that just about being washed awayliterally. IGNATIUS: Here -- Christiane, here's a country on the edge, acountry that's $11 billion in debt to the IMF, barely staggering along,that's fighting an insurgency at home, and all of a sudden, pow, it getshit with this terrible flood. The latest Pakistani estimate is thatthere are 20 million people who are affected in the country. And the question that people are beginning to raise is, is the floodgoing to be the final additional thing that pushes Pakistan into being afailed state? The army is going to have to focus on rebuilding roads,getting food to people -- I mean the Pakistani army here, hopefully withhelp from the U.S. military -- but that means they won't be able tofight the Taliban. I was expecting that there would be an offensive in North Waziristanagainst the Taliban and Al Qaida this fall. I was even going to go look-- go travel with the Pakistani troops. I have a feeling now themilitary will be too busy, and that's just one sign... (CROSSTALK)ROBERTS: Maybe it doesn't matter, though. Maybe -- maybe the factis -- I mean, this is -- this is wishful thinking -- but maybe the factis, is having all of this aid come in from the West -- and particularlyfrom the United States -- and it is our military... DOWD: Almost solely from the United States. ROBERTS: ... also -- right, and it's -- and it's not just ourmilitary. It's USAID and all of our humanitarian organizations. I workwith Save the Children there, and we've been in Pakistan for 30 yearsand doing this kind of work. Seeing that is more important than sayingwe can build a mosque in Manhattan, in terms of dealing with the Muslimworld. FREELAND: Well, that presupposes that the aid is effective. And Ithink to David's point, the other danger -- it's not just that thePakistani army is not in a position now to go on the offensive againstthe Taliban. I think the real danger here is that you find the localIslamic organizations, extremist Islamic organizations turning out to bemore effective at helping... (CROSSTALK)IGNATIUS: ... a lot of people angry... (CROSSTALK)FREELAND: I think that -- I think that... (CROSSTALK)FREELAND: ... why Western support, particularly U.S. support, is soimportant right now. You know, U.S. policy has to try hard to make thePakistanis feel it is not purely a utilitarian relationship, it's notjust transactional, that America cares about Pakistan, not just becauseof its relationship with Afghanistan and the Taliban. (UNKNOWN): Well, the only reason why we're in Pakistan is becauseit is transactional. FREELAND: Yes, so -- so... (UNKNOWN): And it's vital. (CROSSTALK)(UNKNOWN): ... it's vital to our interests and to the interests ofthe world. (CROSSTALK)FREELAND: ... works, because Pakistani... (CROSSTALK)AMANPOUR: And we barely have any time left, but 30 seconds to talkabout Russia about to put the nuclear fuel into the Bushehr plant insouthern Iran. IGNATIUS: If you wanted one more piece of bad news this week forthe Obama administration, it would be that Russia, which has really beenvery cooperative on Iran, which has joined us in U.N. sanctions thathave been tougher than people expected, has decided that it's going toship -- next week it's going to begin to operationalize a nuclearreactor in Iran, a civilian nuclear reactor that generates power. And,you know, that's the last thing this administration would have wanted. AMANPOUR: On that note -- on that note, the roundtable continues inthe green room at abcnews.com/thisweek, where you can also find our factchecks, in conjunction with PolitiFact. Also on our Web site now, dramatic images from Russia this week,where wildfires have ravaged that country. Choking smoke from the firesand record high temperatures have led to hundreds of deaths in Moscow,and the drought has destroyed a quarter of Russia's grain crops. It'snow banned exports, causing price spikes, and raising concerns of aglobal food crisis in the fall. AMANPOUR (voice-over): Good morning. I'm Christiane Amanpour. Andat the top of the news this week, trouble on the road to recovery. Jobless claims are up. (UNKNOWN): The numbers are dismal for employment. AMANPOUR: And Wall Street gets nervous. How worried should we be? And what will bring confidence back? This morning, top voices on theeconomy: former New Jersey Governor and Wall Street CEO Jon Corzine;Republican Senator Bob Corker of the Senate Banking Committee; Obamaeconomic adviser Laura Tyson; and chief economist at the U.S. Then, washed away. Twenty million Pakistanis in danger, as theworst flooding in memory leaves huge areas of the country under water. It's a race against time to bring relief. ""This Week"" has the latestfrom inside the crisis, with U.S. efforts to deliver aid. Plus this week, the president weighs in, defending the mosque andIslamic center near Ground Zero. OBAMA: Muslims have a right to practice their religion, as everyoneelse in this country. AMANPOUR: Or does he? AMANPOUR: That and all the week's news and politics on ourroundtable, with Cokie Roberts, political strategist Matthew Dowd, DavidIgnatius of the Washington Post, and Chrystia Freeland of Thomson Reuters. And the Sunday funnies. LENO: Unemployment among teenagers at an all-time high, all aroundthe world. It's not just here. In fact, in China, it is so bad, kidsas old as seven are having to move back in with their parents. ANNOUNCER: From all across our world to the heart of our nation'scapital, ABC ""This Week"" with Christiane Amanpour starts now. AMANPOUR: Good morning. This was supposed to be the summer ofrecovery, but the effects of the so-called Great Recession continue tocloud this nation and much of the world. The number of U.S. workersseeking unemployment benefits rose unexpectedly to 484,000. It's theworst in almost six months. And in the housing sector, banks foreclosedon more than 90,000 properties in July, the second-highest total sincethe crisis began. And these pictures speak to the desperation this week in Atlanta. Thirty thousand people waited for hours in sweltering heat to apply for655 available spots of government-subsidized housing. And I'm joined by four top voices on the economy. From Berkeley,California, member of the president's Economic Recovery Advisory BoardLaura Tyson. From Chattanooga, Tennessee, Republican Senator Bob Corkerof the Banking Committee. In New York, the former New Jersey governorand CEO of MF Global, Jon Corzine. And joining us here in Washington,chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Martin Regalia. Thank you all for joining me. You've heard the figures. You'veread about the figures. You can also probably palpably feel the concernand worry amongst the American people. And I want to read you somethingthat was written about this joblessness, about the younger generation inthe Atlantic recently. Look at what was written about unemployment. ""There is unemployment -- a brief and relatively routinetransitional state that results from the rise and fall of companies inany economy, and there is unemployment -- chronic, all-consuming. Theformer is a necessary lubricant in any engine of economic growth. Thelatter is a pestilence that slowly eats away at people, families, and,if it spreads widely enough, the fabric of society. Indeed, historysuggests that this is perhaps society's most noxious ill."" Let me turn to you right now, Martin Regalia. Do you agree withthat? And do you think that that's what this country is in right now? REGALIA: Well, I agree with it, and I think that is what we'reseeing right now. We're seeing an economy that is growing, but growingin a very lackluster way. It's not generating enough demand, andtherefore it's not generating enough jobs. And on top of that, the last three or four recessions have givenrise to longer terms of unemployment. More retooling is necessary tobring the displaced workers back into the workforce, and that retoolingis taking a lot longer. AMANPOUR: Let me turn to you, Laura Tyson. You're an adviser tothe president right now. A recent Wall Street Journal poll of some 53economists say they don't see the employment rate coming down below 9percent, you know, at least until June 2011. What can be done about this? TYSON: Well, I think that we have to do a number of things. Ithink we have to worry, first of all, about taking care of the peoplewho are unemployed. And that's why I really have supported theextension of unemployment benefits and the extension of benefits to helppeople maintain their health insurance if they lose their job, very,very important. You have to deal with the reality that people arelong-term unemployed, 7 million people long-term unemployed. Secondly, we have to continue to do everything we can to stimulatedemand in the economy. Let me give you two examples. We do have apayroll tax credit that has been offered to companies that bring on newunemployed workers into the workforce. I think we should continue that. I think we should continue to look at major spending oninfrastructure projects. You know, the good news here about thestimulus, it's said, well, the infrastructure projects haven't come onboard yet. They're coming on board now, and they have highjob-per-dollar-spent outcomes. TYSON: And then, finally, we have to worry about the longer-runproblem of this structural employment, because I'm going to point outone thing for this discussion. The unemployment problem is primarily aproblem for people who have a high school -- who don't have a highschool education or just have a high school education. Unemployment for those with college educations is now 4.5 percent. Unemployment for those with more than a college education, below 4percent. We have a problem of education in this country, and we have toeducate more of our young people fully through college education. Let'stake this as an opportunity to do that. AMANPOUR: Let me ask Senator Corker on the Banking Committee -- andyou've spoken quite a lot about this -- you are in Chattanooga rightnow, and you told me that you have been out in the rural areas, wherethere's really nothing for people out there. You know, beyond -- beyond the current unemployment rate, there'salso underemployment, and it's standing at about 16.5 percent, the totalproblem of people who either don't have a job or who don't have enoughof a job to make ends meet. How is it -- is it impacting the people inthe rural areas? And do you think that this really goes to the heart ofthe American dream that is being deferred? CORKER: Well, you know, as we speak, the city that I'm sitting inhas been named one of the -- is named the top economic producer over thenext decade, and it's because of investment in the workforce. It's avision. It's the fact that we really have held on to trying to producethings. As you go to the rural areas, with the lack of infrastructure thatexists in most rural areas around our country, there's lesseropportunity for that. And so it does create challenges that don't existin some of the major metropolitan areas, and I think we're seeing thatmore and more across our country. At the same time, I think much of what we've done over this lastyear is create an air of unpredictability. And what's happening isbusinesses are sitting on the sideline. They don't know exactly whatthe lay of the land is. And I think the best thing we can do inWashington at this time is really just to calm down and quit changingsweeping -- making sweeping changes. I sat down with a business this week -- I'll give you an example --and they're looking at the health care bill, and they're trying todecide, should they keep people under 30 hours? Smaller businesses aresaying, should we stay under 25? So I think that much of what we've done over this last year hasactually been counterproductive. And, again, the best thing we can dois just calm down, to really let people's balance sheets sort of getback where they need to be. That will stimulate demand over time, asfamilies and people -- households across our country get their balancesheets in order. AMANPOUR: Well, we'll come back to that. You know, the FinancialTimes has basically said that Congress needs to, quote, ""get a grip."" I'm going to ask you about that right after I go to Governor Corzine andask him about what is going to stimulate the kind of consumer confidencethat you were just talking about, Senator -- Senator Corker. Look, there are figures, Governor Corzine, that suggest thatnon-financial companies have socked away something like $1.84 trillionin cash and other assets, but they're not spending them, they're nothiring, they're not building plants and other infrastructure. Why not? And wouldn't -- don't they have a responsibility to do so in this situation? CORZINE: Well, there is a gap of confidence in the economy thatcomes from the shock that we had of 2008 and 2009; $17 trillion worth oflost economic value in that timeframe makes companies and people very,very concerned. Even though we've had a major recovery in some of thatvaluation loss, it makes people nervous. We also -- and I think your quote that you started with actuallyframes what is the real problem. We have both a recession problem thatwas the result of the great financial crisis, but we also have thisgreat transformation that's taking place across the globe. A lot ofother countries are very competitive with the United States today, andwe need to invest in our education system, in our infrastructure system,in our efforts to expand our exports, if we're going to be competitiveas we go forward. AMANPOUR: OK, well, let me ask -- let me ask about that, becausewhen it comes to exports in manufacturing, we read quite a lot thatAmerica has been losing its competitive edge to places like China and --and -- and other such. Laura, what do you think the United States cando to regenerate a competitive export in manufacturing? TYSON: Well, I think the key word Jon raised is investment. And Ithink it is absolutely essential. You know, we get caught up indiscussions of deficit reduction or stimulus. Let's forget those issuesfor a minute and just think about investment. And here it is investment in a number of things. I've heard SenatorCorker talk about the importance of infrastructure. For years goinginto the Great Recession, it has been noted that the U.S. has beeninvesting inadequately in its infrastructure, maybe to the tune of $200billion a year of economically justifiable investment infrastructureswe're not doing. Let me turn to investment in education. It is the case -- we usedto be number one in the world in college graduation rates. We are nownumber 14, number 15. We're leading the world in high school dropoutrates. And as I said, the unemployment problem is most severe in dropouts. So invest in people. Invest in infrastructure. Invest inknowledge. You know, we basically are trying to get the research anddevelopment spending in this country up to 3 percent so we can again beleaders in the world in that. Invest, invest, invest is really what wemust do. Public-private partnerships, you know, with that, $100 billion ofthe stimulus package is levered to private spending. A dollar spent bythe public sector on infrastructure can bring three dollars of privatespending. AMANPOUR: So, Martin Regalia, why isn't the private sectorinvesting, investing, investing? REGALIA: Well, I think, you know, our tax laws and our otherregulatory structure in Washington don't foster that. We tax savingsmultiple times. We don't allow full cost recovery. We don't allowexpensing on investment. We can't even pass an R&D credit extensionthat's been delayed for over a year through a Congress that's fightingwith each other. And when you don't have the kind of laws and the kind of taxstructure that facilitate and encourage investment, you get a lot lessof it. We tax our multinational corporations on their overseas profit. We're the only major trading country in the OECD that still does that,that doesn't have a territorially tax system. And so what do we do? We tell our people, go out and export, andthen we tell them, we're going to tax you more than every other peopleyou have to compete with in the global economy. AMANPOUR: Senator Corker, what about that? We were talking aboutCongress, and you just heard Mr. Regalia talking about Congress fightingwith each other and not getting these things done. What do you thinkcan be done? You said chill out, calm down, perhaps until after theelection. What can be done to fix this, do you think, in a bipartisan way? CORKER: Well, I think one of the things we need to do -- I've heardLaura talking about investment -- is as a country, we need to decide,how much should the federal government spend? On average, it's been20.3 percent over the last 50 years. I heard Erskine Bowles the otherday say 21 percent. But I think much of our debate goes to littleissues that really divide our country, but that needs to be the firstissue. How much should the federal government take in from the privatesector? Once that decision is made -- I might say 18 percent. Erskine maysay 21 percent. Maybe the right number is someplace in between. Butafter that decision is made, what is the appropriate tax policy togenerate economic growth? And I think that some comments have been made about our lack of --the way we tax. We do tax investment. We encourage people to go intodebt. I think our tax policy in this country certainly needs to belooked at, and it needs to be looked at in a way to encourageinvestment, to encourage growth. Obviously, if our gross domestic product grows, then the whole issueof debt diminishes, the kind of things that Laura's talking about aremore able to be done. So I think we -- we need to move to that bigpicture first, look at what's appropriate. I think most people inAmerica would rather determine what to do with their own money versuslet 535 people decide for them. But the fact is that -- that we get mired down in these littleissues that divide us when really we ought to focus as a country on thisbigger issue first. AMANPOUR: So let me go to you, Governor Corzine. You lost anelection -- re-election in your state when you were governor. When youtook office, unemployment was at 4.7 percent. When you left, it was 9.9percent. Is that why you lost? And you've talked about how it waspainful, but in 20/20 hindsight, what could you have learnt from that,do you think? CORZINE: Well, I think that any time the economy is weak,incumbents are going to have challenging re-election on most instances,and that certainly was the case when you have unemployment rise thatmuch. We were in the midst of the financial meltdown and theaftershocks of that in 2009. I think we'll see some of that this fall. But I want to go back to, we have been successful in this country indriving investment with higher tax rates than what we have today. Ithink the issue about setting those and making sure that the expiringtax cuts that are actually on the table at the end of this year, thatneeds to get addressed, and it needs to get addressed relativelyquickly, because that does create uncertainty while that is yet to beresolved. I would hope that the Congress and the president would either say,""We're going to get to a conclusion about the long term,"" or, ""We'regoing to extend this for a year and we'll come back and debate this atanother point in time,"" because that's a major uncertainty overhangingthe economy. CORZINE: In the long run, though, we overemphasize taxes relativeto the general confidence and the well-being of our middle class. Thatcomes together, and you'll see it in the elections. If you have thathigh unemployment rate extending over a period of time, people are goingto be mighty unhappy, and they're going to take it out on both Democratsand Republicans. AMANPOUR: Let me just quickly go to what you've mentioned aboutbeing competitive with the rest of the world. The big story out ofEurope this weekend is that Germany has shown a stronger-than-expectedgrowth over the last quarter. Laura, you were saying something about how Germany had -- had taughtand trained its workforce to compete in these situations. TYSON: Right. Well, Germany has had a long-term commitment tomanufacturing. And it has a very strong manufacturing base. It has amuch larger share of its economy in manufacturing than we do. A major part of that is (inaudible) serious vocational training andvery serious ongoing training for manufacturing workers in Germany. Andoftentimes a German firm with German workers will retrain and usetechnology at home rather than offshore those jobs abroad. TYSON: And I want to point out, also, that Germany manages to dothis with a much higher tax rate than we do. I think there should becorporate tax reform. I agree with what -- a lot of what Senator Corkerand Martin Regalia have said, but we need investment. And I would say, in thinking about the share of government and GDP,something that the senator mentioned, we need to distinguish betweeninvestment spending by the government -- whether it's federal, state orlocal -- and other spending. TYSON: A dollar spent for infrastructure is different than a dollarspent for current operations of government. AMANPOUR: All right. We've got about 30 seconds left. I want toknow, do you think, Martin Regalia -- and then Senator Corker -- cansome confidence be injected into the American consumer anytime soon? REGALIA: Yes, I think it can. I think one thing that we have toaddress right away is, what's going to happen at the end of the yearwith the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts? There ought to be an extension, atleast a temporary extension, and that would help to -- to ease both theconsumers' fears and the business fears. AMANPOUR: Senator Corker, 15 seconds. CORKER: Yes, I agree with that. Let's -- let's leave tax policy asit is. Mark Zandi had a great piece today in the New York Times sayingthe same. Let's not fiddle any more. Let's leave it -- let's leavethings so they're predictable and deal with -- deal with this down the road. AMANPOUR: Well, we'll see how that plays out ahead of the electionsand afterwards. Thank you all for joining us on this important topic. AMANPOUR: And we turn now to Pakistan, a major U.S. ally, where amajor humanitarian crisis in its third week. Pakistan's government saysthe worst flooding in that nation's history has left 20 million peoplehomeless. U.S. military helicopters are providing a lifeline for manythere, but the U.N. says that 6 million people are in need of food,water and shelter. ABC's Jim Sciutto flew into Pakistan's Swat Valley with a U.S. Armyrelief mission. SCIUTTO (voice-over): From the air, the scale of the disaster isalarming, rivers swollen miles beyond their banks, behind them, a trailof destruction. (UNKNOWN): I've never seen such a large area receive as much damageas I have seen in Swat. SCIUTTO: Flying into the hard-hit Swat Valley aboard U.S. Armyrelief helicopters, we saw every single bridge destroyed, and on theground, villages now dependent on aid from the air. In Bahrain, population 40,000, its once waterfront hotels now in thewater. It has no power, no clean water, and no roads in or out. (on-screen): So it's cut on both sides? (UNKNOWN): Yes, it's gone on both sides. SCIUTTO: So this is -- this is an island now? (UNKNOWN): (OFF-MIKE) is an island. SCIUTTO: These American helicopters are ferrying supplies frombases like this one to villages that are completely cut off. We'reseeing rice and flour and other supplies going in. The helicopters aretoday their only lifeline. (voice-over): Food, much of it from the U.S., in, refugees out. For the fight crews diverted to relief from combat in Afghanistan, it isa dramatic shift. (UNKNOWN): I sat down and spoke to all the troops about turningthat switch off. But the first time I looked at those children needinghelp, I was no longer concerned. SCIUTTO: U.S. and Pakistani relief teams are fighting against theclock. This weekend, the first confirmed cases of cholera, apotentially deadly disease that's the result of the lack of cleandrinking water. For many Pakistanis, the flooding and its aftermath is a grittyreminder of all the ways the government has failed them, a ploddingresponse, a state budget dependent on fallen loans, shoddyinfrastructure. Seeking to take advantage of the chaos, the Taliban isdelivering help where the government is not, particularly in Swat, whichsaw the end of a massive anti-militant offensive just weeks ago. For the U.S., however, one sign of hope. America is deeplyunpopular here, but the relief effort is winning hearts and minds. Among them, the mayor of Bahrain, who told me the U.S. is outdoingPakistan's Muslim allies. (UNKNOWN): And in this disaster, the Islamic countries give theiraid after America. SCIUTTO (on-screen): Does that surprise you? (UNKNOWN): Yes, surprise, surprise. SCIUTTO: A good surprise? (UNKNOWN): Good surprise, yes. SCIUTTO: The first priority of the American relief effort is tohelp the millions in need, but U.S. officials will say very openly it'salso intended to improve America's dismal image here. Sixty-eightpercent of Pakistanis view the U.S. negatively, and the sight of thoseAmerican helicopters a very tangible form of outreach. And, Christiane, on a lot of that food going in, we've seen themlabeled very prominently with American flags. AMANPOUR: Jim, indeed. Let's just talk a little bit more aboutthat, because you mentioned the disapproval rate because of the dronestrikes, because of going after terrorists that kill quite a lot ofcivilians. How are you noticing that in these areas Americans areactually being received warmly because of this aid? SCIUTTO: Well, we see them getting hugged. They're getting kissesliterally on the ground from these troops and thanks, gratitude for thisaid that they're in desperate need of. That said, nationally, the Pakistani media is not covering the U.S. relief effort very closely. They're focusing -- perhaps notsurprisingly -- on the Pakistani relief effort. And in a sign of thesensitivity of simply being associated with the U.S., the U.S. will notidentify local Pakistani NGOs that it's giving aid to so it doesn't openup the risk that they're subject -- that they're targeted for terrorattacks. AMANPOUR: And, Jim, very quickly, the Pakistani troops, are theybeing diverted from fighting the militants? SCIUTTO: Well, there are 50,000 Pakistani troops involved in thisrelief effort. Pakistani officials say that none of them have beendiverted from the border or from counterterror operations. And U.S. officials that we've spoken to today say they believe thosereassurances. And they say, Christiane, that counterterror operationswith the Pakistanis are underway as we speak. AMANPOUR: Jim, thanks so much, from Islamabad. And in response to my questions on the disaster, you can seecomments from U.S. Special Representative to Afghanistan and PakistanRichard Holbrooke on our Web site at abcnews.com/thisweek. And coming up next, the president's decision to weigh in on thecontroversial Islamic center near Ground Zero on our roundtable withCokie Roberts, Matthew Dowd, David Ignatius, and Chrystia Freeland. (UNKNOWN): How is that healing, by building a mosque, anin-your-face mosque at Ground Zero? (UNKNOWN): It's like spraying swastikas all over a Jewish memorial. BLOOMBERG: We would be untrue to the best part of ourselves and whowe are as New Yorkers and Americans if we said no to a mosque in lowerManhattan. KING: This is such a sensitive issue. This, to me, is such a wrongplace to have a mosque such as this. OBAMA: I believe that Muslims have the right to practice theirreligion, as everyone else in this country. That includes the right tobuild a place of worship and a community center on private property inlower Manhattan in accordance with local laws and ordinances. AMANPOUR: The president waded into the controversy over the Islamiccenter near Ground Zero, one of the topics that we'll be discussing thismorning in our roundtable, with political strategist Matthew Dowd,Chrystia Freeland of Thomson Reuters, David Ignatius of the WashingtonPost, and our own Cokie Roberts. George Will is still on vacation. Thank you all for joining us. You did see that speech by thepresident on Friday night at the Iftar Ramadan dinner at the WhiteHouse. Why do you think he said that then? ROBERTS: I think he said that then because he actually believesthat, but the real question is, why that he didn't say the next daysomething more? Do you want to talk about that? AMANPOUR: Yes, we do, because we're going to put up some pollnumbers and just show everybody what the poll numbers are on thisissue. One poll says, when they ask about what people think about theplan to build the mosque, that only 30 percent say it's appropriate and64 percent say it's wrong, but when they say do the Muslim group have aright to build the mosque, 61 percent say yes and 34 percent say no. So I guess, is that, do you think, what caused the backtracking? Although those poll numbers were out before the speech on Friday night. Listen to what the president said in the gulf in Florida on Saturday,yesterday. OBAMA: I was not commenting and I will not comment on the wisdom ofmaking a decision to put a mosque there. I was commenting veryspecifically on the right that people have that dates back to ourfounding. That's what our country is about. ROBERTS: That's really not what he was doing. I mean, if youlisten -- as you played the whole first part of what he said -- he saidthey have a right to build on private property, all of that, and --granted, he didn't say it's wise to build on private property, but itwas very clearly an endorsement. And then to walk back from it is justso silly. He's already taken all the flack for having said it. DOWD: I think they figured out this is a real political problemthey have. And I think they either had a tin ear at the beginning ofthis and how it was going to come across or they mishandled it totallyfrom the beginning, because if they understood, I think, the public onthis, where two-thirds of the public say they have a right buttwo-thirds of the public say don't do it, he would have given a speechgoing directly to those points, instead of saying -- one day saying theyhave the right and the next day saying I didn't necessarily say it wasthe right thing to do. I think this is a big problem for the president, because it feeds abroader narrative about him, which is, it's my way or the highway. Inmany ways, to me, it reminds me of Bush, which is, is, ""I don't carewhere the American public is on this. I'm going to say what I think isthe right thing to do."" He did on -- he's done it on immigration in Arizona. He's done iton this. He's done it on health care. I think that's the politicalproblem... IGNATIUS: ... problem for him. I thought that the speech Fridaynight was a model of political courage, in the sense that he said whathe believed knowing that it was going to cost him. The White House hasstayed out of this issue knowing that it's political poison, and I thinkthe president spoke to it fairly directly. This is America. Peoplehave a right to build on property that they own, even if it's going tobe a mosque near Ground Zero. He said -- I was sort of sorry that he was trying to walk it back inthese more nuanced comments yesterday. FREELAND: I totally agree with David. And I think, you know, Matt,too, the point of my way or the highway, another way of talking aboutthat is leadership, conviction, having your beliefs, and not governingaccording to polls. And I think if you asked most Americans, what kind of a leader doyou want, if you ask people in the world what kind of a leader, you wantsomeone who governs according to conviction. And I do think this touches on, Christiane, the economic panel thatyou had earlier. I think that it touches on it in two important ways. This point about private property might seem like a parsing, but it isactually essential. And I think to have the president -- and we had similar commentsfrom Mike Bloomberg coming out and saying, actually, we believe that therights of private property are so strong, we are not going to changethem because -- because... AMANPOUR: But there are two issues, Cokie. Where does this go fromnow? I mean, where does it actually go? Is this now a line drawn underit? ROBERTS: No, I think that... AMANPOUR: ... to get built? ROBERTS: Well, that's -- that's an issue that I certainly can'tanswer, but I -- my guess is, eventually it does get built and that itbecomes no problem. But the -- but the political issue will continue, because eventhough the president's remarks Friday night started a firestorm, I thinkthe backtracking is even worse, because, you know, you can make a casethat what he said Friday night is just a matter of fact, it is anAmerican right, but to keep -- to keep saying, well, now I'm not sureabout this, and then what tomorrow is like... AMANPOUR: ... I just want to ask you, because it does go to theheart of what he's been doing since the beginning of his presidency,reaching out to the -- not just the Muslim world, but to Muslims ingeneral. And he made a very important first interview, where he saidthe United States could not afford to have yet another generation ofMuslims viewing it as the enemy. So do you think it's wise to have this huge hubbub over it or itshould just go forward, this mosque? DOWD: Well, he would -- the president would like this to sort ofjust go away and not have a huge hubbub about this. The problem is, isthat two-thirds of the country are opposed to him on this. That's aproblem for a president of the United States. I think he is in totally -- he states what's in the Constitution. They have a right to build it. That's not the point in this. That isnot the point in this. You have a right for free speech. It doesn'tmean that you can go and like yell... IGNATIUS: Standing up for free speech for Muslims is -- is a pointin this climate. FREELAND: Where is that not the point? DOWD: But it -- it -- the point is, is that you have to buildconsensus on this. Tolerance goes two ways. Tolerance goes two ways. Tolerance is the tolerance to somebody to build on private property whatthey want, but tolerance also is to recognize what that symbolicallysays to a whole bunch of people in this country. And if you don'trecognize that, you're going to have this kind of furor. AMANPOUR: Do you think it should go ahead? DOWD: Do I think it should go ahead? No. I think he should calltogether the people -- there's many Muslims and many people in the Arabcommunity that are very worried about this happening, actually, thatthey voiced in there. I think he or somebody should call together something, put this onhold for a little while, bring together some consensus about what peopleshould do, because right now, it's white hot. AMANPOUR: But what do you do then? It is white hot -- you'reabsolutely right -- right now. But what do you do when the actualowners, the people who want to build this are in the moderate stream ofMuslims, did go to the White House? You were there when they did, when-- when this gentleman did, condemned 9/11, condemned extremism,condemned terrorism, and now they're faced with this situation? ROBERTS: Well, there are -- there are ways always of making thesesituations just less hot. And it is a question of suggesting otherplaces, providing other places. Those kinds of things can always beworked out. FREELAND: But let's talk a little bit about the rest of the world. You know, I think that actually the president's comments, the commentsby Mike Bloomberg are a really important message to the Muslim world. And we're going to be talking about Pakistan later on. For thesepeople, for American leaders to say, in the space of, you know, somepolitical pressure from their voters, to say, actually, we believesufficiently strongly in diversity, in private property rights for ourAmerican citizens, I think that's a great... IGNATIUS: ... our strongest -- our strongest suits. ROBERTS: ... coming back from it is the problem. IGNATIUS: As the world looks at us, if they see that the UnitedStates -- even in -- you know, an issue that hurts -- and Ground Zerohurts -- even on that issue, we still stand up for the freedom of peopleto dispose of their property as they want, that does count. When I travel, you travel, Christiane, you know, we hear commentsabout that America a lot. And I think you shouldn't minimize thebenefits of -- of saying to moderate Muslims, ""Here you are. Thisupsets a lot of Americans, but we're""... FREELAND: ... if the people you're being tolerant of... DOWD: There's two freedoms in conflict here. There's two freedomsin conflict. There's the freedom to build on your private property andthen the freedom for people to protest and say this is not what we want. IGNATIUS: Understood. DOWD: I think the president obviously has to lead in this countryand lead in the world. The problem with this one is he is speaking froma position of weakness, not a position of strength. And so if he doesnot have consensus... AMANPOUR: Why do you say that? DOWD: He is in a total position -- his approval numbers in thiscountry are in the low 40s. He's perceived as not able to handle allthe major issues in this country right now. The vast majority of thiscountry right now questions his leadership. For him to go out on an issue like this that is white hot and thensay, ""I'm going to say it, and I'm going to lead the rest of the world,""while two-thirds of this country is in another place, is a real problemfor him. AMANPOUR: So, clearly, the consensus appears that it should havebeen arranged, debated, done in a slightly better way between those whowanted to actually build it and the community, whether they're Jewishmembers of the community, Christians, or other Muslims. And one of the tragedies seems to me that the actual imam wastalking -- and his wife -- to the -- to the people who put up the Jewishcommunity center in New York and was talking about how to have somethingsimilar like that. And it seems to have all gone awry. Let's move on to politics, because this week was also -- and this is(inaudible) was primary week in -- in -- in many states. Some have saida group of sort of -- political playbook said oddball character iscoming out of right field. What -- whether you believe or agree withthat or not -- do you think is the effect of those who've won in someareas, the Tea Party candidates, those who supported? DOWD: Well, it's interesting. ABC, I think over the last couple ofmonths, has done a great job of sort of gauging the frustration thatexists in this country, and it's high as it was in 1992, as high as it'sbeen in 2008. It's not just limited to Republicans. It's independentsand some Democrats in this. I think these primaries have shown that there are some places whereit's real anger that's related to frustration and then it's other placeswhich a majority (ph) which is related to frustration. I think the Republican Party right now, it is the comparison betweena bonfire there and a campfire in the Democratic primary. So you canhandle the campfire, but the bonfire, which is what helped elect TeaParty people and what's gone on across just headed into November. I think this is perilous for both parties, actually. I think it'sperilous for the Republicans if they become the Tea Party folks, whichare sort of out of the mainstream and are going to have a hard timewinning November elections, but it's also perilous, I think, for theDemocrats if they ignore this level of frustration and they don't dealwith it. ROBERTS: That's right. They -- now, they've had plenty of time tolearn about it, and they've had town meetings and heard about it and allthat, so they're not going to be taken by surprise. But they think thatthey can just go back to the old playbook, so they're pulling out SocialSecurity, and they're running against George Bush, and they're doingthings that have worked for them in the past that I'm not at all surewill work for them this year, and that could be a real problem, becausethey're not understanding the level of frustration. IGNATIUS: The Democrats sound this year with this president likethe party of the establishment. And we have a political firestorm outin the country. People are really angry. They're angry at Washington. They're angry about the economy. The Tea Party is an expression ofthat, but what Robert Gibbs, the president's press secretary, wascalling the professional left is another example of that, people whojust are angry at the mainstream, centrist views the president often hasbeen espousing. And I think that's a real problem for them. They don't have theenergy. They're not tapping into this energy source as they headtowards the elections. FREELAND: Well, doesn't it just all come down to the economy? ROBERTS: Well, sure. Sure. FREELAND: I mean, you know, I don't want to be too simplistic, butwith unemployment at nearly 10 percent, I thought the comments that JonCorzine made earlier were right on, that this is a double whammy, thisis a recession following a financial crisis, and this is also the finalact of America's structural adjustment to globalization and thetechnology revolution. That's a really big deal. And I think the real problem is not --you know, we're going to be focused a lot on messaging and cosmeticsahead of the midterms. The real question is, can an American politicalparty or political movement come up with a powerful economic plan, andone that is maybe really different? And we're seeing that happen in other countries. Look at Britain. David Cameron's Tories won with a really radical plan, and they gotactually... IGNATIUS: ... just doesn't work. I mean, it's not like they didn'thave a plan. DOWD: Republicans don't really have to come up with anything overthe next 90 days. ROBERTS: No, that's right. DOWD: They're going to win a huge amount of seats in the House, ahuge amount of seats in the Senate. They're going to win a bunch ofgovernors' races. To me, the economy is representative of a bigger issue that's outthere. I agree the economy is the number-one issue. The problem is, ispeople out there do not think Washington is listening to them. Theydon't think they're paying attention to what's going on in America. And the reason why the economy is so -- has so much anger in it isbecause people don't think they're being empathetic with where they arein their life. And that's, I think, a problem. ROBERTS: But they're also -- you know, the voters were also veryambivalent themselves, because on the one hand, the furious... ROBERTS: Right, exactly. They're furious with Washington for beingfurious and for everybody fighting with each other and why doesn'tanything work, and yet they're furious and feed into that partisanshiptremendously so that there's no right answer for the politicians as theygo to face the voters. AMANPOUR: But also these primaries this week, the White House andDemocrats were saying that it's not such a bad bag. We (inaudible)comfort from some of the results there. ROBERTS: Well, because they were able to re-nominate Michael Bennetin Colorado, and that made them feel good, because they had backed him. But, you know, Newt Gingrich had backed Nathan Deal in Georgia, too, andhe won against Sarah Palin's candidate. So, you know... AMANPOUR: What does that say about the sort of star of the TeaParty movement? DOWD: Well, I mean, endorsements always to me are questionableanyway, because the voters ultimately make the decision. I think stillSarah Palin -- Sarah Palin on the Republican side has the most energyand emotion and passion behind her than any other candidate. She canstill walk into a city and get 3,000, 5,000 people. No one can dothat. So she can have that emotionally. She can charge that, andultimately it's about her. I think the interesting thing on the results is that, there's thisbig wave coming into Washington, and Democrats have a seawall. Andwhat's happened now is Republicans have nominated people that may not beable to win. And so basically the Republicans are putting bricks on topof the seawall and building it higher, that they're going to have lesschance of winning in this election because of who they've nominated insome of these places. IGNATIUS: You know, their biggest problem would be... ROBERTS: Working on that seawall. IGNATIUS: ... I suspect, if they -- if they did win. Suppose theRepublicans did win control of the House and the Senate. What wouldthey do? What would their program be? You know, they'd be a mucheasier mark for the Democrats heading toward the 2012 presidentialelection. You almost think it would be better for Obama... ROBERTS: Well, of course it would be better for Obama. FREELAND: You can try to triangulate... DOWD: ... 2012 if the Republicans took one of the branches, becausethey could either do one of two things which would be beneficial tohim. He could compromise and then show him, he's going to buildbridges, or he could just say, ""They're the problem, they're the problem."" The fear I think the White House has is he's going to get the worstpossible result, which is a small margin in the House, a small margin inthe Senate, he can't get anything done, but he owns all the levers ofgovernment... AMANPOUR: So now that we've settled that one, let's move right outof the country to Pakistan briefly, because we did talk about it withJim Sciutto, but it's been likened to their Katrina. The U.S. is doingthe right thing sending relief, right? DOWD: Yes, absolutely. AMANPOUR: Politically, economically. ROBERTS: Humanitarian. AMANPOUR: Humanitarian, of course... FREELAND: Strategically. AMANPOUR: Exactly. What do you think, though, when you look atthis, here's the fight, here's Pakistan nuclear-armed, here's Pakistanhaving done the right thing, to an extent, having sent its army afterthe militants, and all of that, all of that just about being washed awayliterally. IGNATIUS: Here -- Christiane, here's a country on the edge, acountry that's $11 billion in debt to the IMF, barely staggering along,that's fighting an insurgency at home, and all of a sudden, pow, it getshit with this terrible flood. The latest Pakistani estimate is thatthere are 20 million people who are affected in the country. And the question that people are beginning to raise is, is the floodgoing to be the final additional thing that pushes Pakistan into being afailed state? The army is going to have to focus on rebuilding roads,getting food to people -- I mean the Pakistani army here, hopefully withhelp from the U.S. military -- but that means they won't be able tofight the Taliban. I was expecting that there would be an offensive in North Waziristanagainst the Taliban and Al Qaida this fall. I was even going to go look-- go travel with the Pakistani troops. I have a feeling now themilitary will be too busy, and that's just one sign... ROBERTS: Maybe it doesn't matter, though. Maybe -- maybe the factis -- I mean, this is -- this is wishful thinking -- but maybe the factis, is having all of this aid come in from the West -- and particularlyfrom the United States -- and it is our military... DOWD: Almost solely from the United States. ROBERTS: ... also -- right, and it's -- and it's not just ourmilitary. It's USAID and all of our humanitarian organizations. I workwith Save the Children there, and we've been in Pakistan for 30 yearsand doing this kind of work. Seeing that is more important than sayingwe can build a mosque in Manhattan, in terms of dealing with the Muslimworld. FREELAND: Well, that presupposes that the aid is effective. And Ithink to David's point, the other danger -- it's not just that thePakistani army is not in a position now to go on the offensive againstthe Taliban. I think the real danger here is that you find the localIslamic organizations, extremist Islamic organizations turning out to bemore effective at helping... IGNATIUS: ... a lot of people angry... FREELAND: I think that -- I think that... FREELAND: ... why Western support, particularly U.S. support, is soimportant right now. You know, U.S. policy has to try hard to make thePakistanis feel it is not purely a utilitarian relationship, it's notjust transactional, that America cares about Pakistan, not just becauseof its relationship with Afghanistan and the Taliban. (UNKNOWN): Well, the only reason why we're in Pakistan is becauseit is transactional. FREELAND: Yes, so -- so... (UNKNOWN): And it's vital. (UNKNOWN): ... it's vital to our interests and to the interests ofthe world. FREELAND: ... works, because Pakistani... AMANPOUR: And we barely have any time left, but 30 seconds to talkabout Russia about to put the nuclear fuel into the Bushehr plant insouthern Iran. IGNATIUS: If you wanted one more piece of bad news this week forthe Obama administration, it would be that Russia, which has really beenvery cooperative on Iran, which has joined us in U.N. sanctions thathave been tougher than people expected, has decided that it's going toship -- next week it's going to begin to operationalize a nuclearreactor in Iran, a civilian nuclear reactor that generates power. And,you know, that's the last thing this administration would have wanted. AMANPOUR: On that note -- on that note, the roundtable continues inthe green room at abcnews.com/thisweek, where you can also find our factchecks, in conjunction with PolitiFact. Also on our Web site now, dramatic images from Russia this week,where wildfires have ravaged that country. Choking smoke from the firesand record high temperatures have led to hundreds of deaths in Moscow,and the drought has destroyed a quarter of Russia's grain crops. It'snow banned exports, causing price spikes, and raising concerns of aglobal food crisis in the fall."	1.0

That's why she says she has Hillary Clinton's back and she is fighting to protect the Obama legacy.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)ZELENY (voice-over): For the first time, tonight, the first lady and a former one on stage together.MICHELLE OBAMA, FIRST LADY: She is absolutely ready to be commander in chief on day one. And, yes, she happens to be a woman.ZELENY: Rallying Democrats in North Carolina.HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Seriously, is there anyone more inspiring than Michelle Obama?ZELENY: A first lady tag team. Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama, going hard after Donald Trump in a race divided by deep gender lines.OBAMA: We want a president who values and honor women, who teaches our daughters and our sons that women are full and equal human beings worthy and deserving of love and respect.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)ZELENY: The Clinton campaign calls her their not-so-secret weapon, a tiring cliche, but a true one, that bluntly acknowledges Secretary Clinton needs Mrs. Obama.CLINTON: No one knows more about what's at stake in this election than our first lady.ZELENY: Sixteen years ago, in the closing months of Mrs. Clinton's time as first lady, she was running for Senate in New York. Mrs. Obama has no interest in being on the ballot now or ever, friends say. A comment she made in the 2008 campaign is now being revisited as a swipe at Clinton.OBAMA: If you can't run your own house, you certainly can't run the White House.ZELENY: Just last week, Trump raising it in North Carolina.TRUMP: Wasn't she the one that originally started the statement, if you can't take care of your home, right?ZELENY: Aides to Obama say she was not talking about Clinton, who they say she respects and has grown fond of.OBAMA: Hillary Clinton is my friend.ZELENY: Now Clinton is hoping the popularity of both Obamas rubs off, the president's approval rating at 59 percent in a new CNN/ORC poll, and 54 percent believe things in the country are going well.The Clinton campaign's new balancing act, projecting confidence and warding off complacency. A CNN poll of polls, an average of the five latest national surveys, shows Clinton with a six-point edge over Trump. Tonight, the campaign bracing for even more hacked e-mails offering an unflattering look inside Clinton world.After ""The New York Times"" first reported Clinton's private e-mail server in March 2015, campaign chairman John Podesta sounded the alarm within hours. ""Did you have any idea of the depth of this story?"" he wrote to Robby Mook, the campaign manager. He replied, ""Nope. We brought up the existence of e-mails in research this summer, but were told that everything was taken care of.""Since then, Clinton and her campaign have tried to downplay it, yet Clinton confidants probably knew it was a problem, as former aide Neera Tanden made clear in an e-mail to Podesta last you're: ""Do we actually know who told Hillary she could use a private e-mail? And has that person been drawn and quartered?"" -- going on to say, ""Like, the whole thing is 'expletive' insane.""(END VIDEOTAPE)[18:05:12]ZELENY: There's no question the leaks, this release of these e-mails is rocking the campaign.One aide told me today it's taking away some of the joy they thought they would have in the final days here, Wolf. They're also keeping close track through focus groups and polling to make sure voters aren't being affected by this.That's why they're trying to lock in the early vote now. In fact, at this moment, Secretary Clinton still here in North Carolina speaking to more voters. They are trying to get these 15 electoral votes.Wolf, it was just earlier this summer where she paid a visit to North Carolina with President Obama for the first time. No coincidence she came back to North Carolina with Michelle Obama in tow still trying to get the Obama coalition fired up for her candidacy -- Wolf.BLITZER: All right, Jeff, thank you, good report, Jeff Zeleny reporting.Let's go to Ohio right now for the latest on Donald Trump's message with just a dozen days to go until the election.Sunlen Serfaty is on the scene for us.Sunlen, Trump has a narrow path to 270 electoral votes, but a win in Ohio could certainly make a difference.SUNLEN SERFATY, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Ohio certainly is must- win for the Trump campaign, Wolf, which is why we're seeing them make such a big push here in Ohio, three states -- for Donald Trump in this state today alone.Trump campaign advisers openly admit their path to 270 is, in their words, an uphill climb. But they're also looking at these recent battleground polls, state polls, including here in Ohio, Ohio, which show that the race is tightening. So they are seeing that they are now in a better position than they were just a week ago.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)SERFATY (voice-over): Donald Trump blanketing the battleground state of Ohio today.TRUMP: In 12 days, we're going to win Ohio, and we are going to win back the White House.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)SERFATY: The state and its 18 electoral votes critical to Trump's path to the White House.TRUMP: Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare a make it even worse.SERFATY: With less than two weeks left in the campaign, Trump is staying on the attack against Clinton and seizing on the steady drip of hacked e-mails from Clinton's campaign chairman coming from WikiLeaks.TRUMP: If the Clintons were willing to play this fast and loose with their enterprise when they weren't in the White House, just imagine what they will do given the chance to once again control the Oval Office.SERFATY: Even as he backs off his recent threat to sue the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct.TRUMP: All of these liars will be sued after the election is over.SERFATY: No longer saying he will go through with it.TRUMP: We will find out. Let's see what happens with the election. We're going to find out.SERFATY: Trump revealing today his campaign is planning to deploy his wife, Melania, for a series of closing speeches.TRUMP: She has agreed to do two or three speeches, and I think it's going to be big speeches, important speeches.SERFATY: Melania has been largely absent from the campaign trail since her convention speech in July. But the Trump campaign is leaning on her voice now to help improve her husband's standing with women.MELANIA TRUMP, WIFE OF DONALD TRUMP: I support him 100 percent, and I am there for him every time he needs me, and I am going to join him. SERFATY: Meantime, Trump reclaiming some support in the new tossupstate of Utah from Congressman Jason Chaffetz. The Republican withdrew his support after Trump's sexually aggressive comments about women in 2005 were made public.REP. JASON CHAFFETZ (R), UTAH: I am out. I can no longer endorse Donald Trump for president. We have a 15-year-old daughter. You think I can look her in the eye and tell her that I endorse Donald Trump for president when he acts like this and his apology?SERFATY: But now, after nearly a dozen women have come forward to accuse Trump of sexual assault or harassment, Chaffetz is saying -- quote -- ""I will not defend nor endorse Donald Trump, but I am voting for him. HRC is that bad.""Some Republicans are considering the prospects of a Clinton administration. Chaffetz, chair of the House Oversight Committee, promising years of congressional investigations, telling ""The Washington Post"" -- quote -- ""Even before we get to day one, we have got two years' worth of material already lined up.""And Senator Ted Cruz warning Republicans might not vote on the nomination for the Supreme Court seat vacated by the death of Justice Scalia.SEN. TED CRUZ (R), TEXAS: There's certainly long historical precedent with a Supreme Court with fewer justices.(END VIDEOTAPE)SERFATY: And in that interview where Donald Trump today revealed that his wife, Melania, would be making two or three big speeches in the final stretch for him, Melania seemed a bit off-guard by that. She seemed surprised by that suggestion.And the Trump campaign, Wolf, they have not gotten back on specifics where or when those big speeches very Melania would be given in this final stretch -- Wolf.[18:10:01]BLITZER: All right, we will be anxious to cover those speeches, if they take place.Sunlen, thanks very, very much.In the last hour, I spoke to Democratic Senator and Hillary Clinton supporter Chris Coons.Now we're joined now by a top Donald Trump supporter, Republican Congressman Sean Duffy.Congressman, thanks very much for joining us.REP. SEAN DUFFY (R), WISCONSIN: Hey. It's good to be back with you, Wolf. BLITZER: Let's talk about some of these new polls that just came outtoday showing Donald Trump losing his lead, get this, in states he had been doing very well in. In Georgia, for example, a traditionally red state, right now, he's only behind by one -- she's only behind by one point, 44 percent for Trump, 43 percent for Hillary Clinton.Look at Iowa right now. In Iowa, he had been doing really well, 44 percent, 44 percent. A month ago, both of those states, Trump was up by seven points in both states. Why is he slipping?DUFFY: Well, first off, I think Georgia is not going to be a problem for Donald Trump. That's a Republican state. As voters go to the polls, they will break Donald Trump's way. We will win Georgia.But, obviously, some of the trouble that Donald Trump has had over the last month has caused him to slip not just in Iowa, but in all these states and the national polls across the country.But what's interesting, Wolf, is he's actually come back in dramatic fashion. And you have been talking about this all day, but in Florida, North Carolina, in Iowa, Ohio, Nevada, and I will tell you, Wisconsin is doing incredibly well for Mr. Trump. So he has this inside track. He has to hit everything right. But if he does, he's within striking distance in these swing states, and he could pull this victory out.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: We checked, Congressman, in your home state of Wisconsin. The last poll that we have, a scientific poll, Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin was up by seven points in Wisconsin. So do you think he really has a chance of capturing Wisconsin?DUFFY: I do.So, in Wisconsin, this was the home of the Scott Walker recalls. The Republican Party in Wisconsin is the best Republican Party in the country. We are turning out almost as many door-knocks and phone calls as Florida and Ohio. And so our base is activated.Now, we still have a little problem in Southeast Wisconsin with the Republicans. But as those Republicans come home, with all the work we have done across the state, this will be a nail-biter. And I think Wisconsin will go to Trump in the end.BLITZER: Yes, but every poll we have seen, Hillary Clinton in your state of Wisconsin is up seven or eight points.Is Trump, has he been there lately, is he planning on going in the final 12 days? Or has he basically written off Wisconsin?DUFFY: I have seen internal polls as well. And we try to get the best and most accurate data possible so we can function with good data.And I would say it's far closer than the recent poll that you cite. But so Mr. Trump was here, oh, a little over a week ago. I'm hopeful, and there's been rumblings that he might come back, whether it's this coming weekend or early next week. But he knows that outside of, again, Florida, North Carolina, Iowa, Ohio, Nevada, he needs another state.And if it's not Pennsylvania, and I think Pennsylvania is getting really tough to grab for him, I think Wisconsin is the next best play. Again, a great ground game, an activated Republican base, and the internal polls that I have seen, it's much closer than the ones that you have cited.BLITZER: How much of a problem in Wisconsin -- the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan is, of course, from Wisconsin. He's a friend of yours. He's doing nothing. He's not campaigning out there in Wisconsin or, for that matter, anyplace else for Donald Trump, is he?DUFFY: Well, so, well, what he's done is, he's funded the whole Wisconsin GOP operation.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: But he's trying to get Republicans elected in Wisconsin, but I don't see him out there on the campaign trail with Donald Trump or even speaking about Donald Trump, for that matter.DUFFY: We have to be frank.We have far more House seats that are in play today than they were six weeks ago. So Mr. Ryan is out there talking about the Republican message, the Republican vision, and also raising money to make sure we can push back against an onslaught of Democrat cash that's just raining a bit of hellfire on us. They have way more money than we do.And so Mr. Ryan is out there making sure we have the resources to fight back. And that's a full-time job. So, he's working on keeping the House. Donald Trump is working on winning the presidency. And those are two different jobs that take two different roles and two different missions.BLITZER: But the point I'm trying to make, and you know this well, Paul Ryan in Wisconsin especially, he's very popular in your home state.DUFFY: Yes.BLITZER: If he were out there speaking publicly, not only trying to get Republicans elected in the House and the Senate, governor's races or whatever, but if he were out there really actively promoting Donald Trump, that could make a difference.DUFFY: It could, but, Wolf, I don't want to speak for Paul. I haven't had this conversation with him, so I'm going to surmise here. I want to be clear on that.But there's a lot of Republicans across the country, they might be down in their districts by -- or Mr. Trump might be down in their districts by maybe 15 points or 20 points. So, they have to outperform him by big numbers.[18:15:07]And so Paul is not just looking at Wisconsin, and how Wisconsin plays for Mr. Trump. He's looking at our national playing field and how he has to make sure that we come back and we're in the majority, we don't have Speaker Nancy Pelosi.And so he doesn't wear just one hat. He wears multiple hats. And I will just tell you, Donald Trump is doing just fine here himself. And, listen, do I suspect that Mr. Ryan is going to vote for Donald Trump? I suspect so. And we will see.BLITZER: Donald Trump tweeted this today, and I will put it up on the screen, Congressman. He tweeted this.He said: ""A lot of call-ins about vote-flipping at the voting booths in Texas. People are not happy. Big lines. What is going on?""Election officials say that they have had some human error basically in some of the tablets. They have got electronic voting there. But they don't think it's a big problem. Is he raising this problem to suggest that the entire election system, as he keeps saying, is rigged?DUFFY: Well, from my perspective, I have heard the same stories about the voting machines switching votes.We know that dead people across America are still voting, miraculously. And we know that some people are voting twice. Now, do I think that's so widespread, Wolf, that it's going to take the election away from Hillary Clinton or from Donald Trump? I don't think that's the case.But on these electronic voting machines, I don't like them. I think -- and this is what we do in my district here in Wisconsin. You fill out your paper ballot and then you put it through the electronic reader, but you can go back and look at the paper ballots, as opposed to just having everything electronic.And if someone has messed with the programming, that can tweak the results of a race. And I don't have any evidence or information that there's any widespread problems across the country. But I do think it's incumbent upon us as Americans and as elected American officials that we try to get the best result possible, which is clear the dead folks out.Make sure there's swift and significant penalties for those who violate the laws and vote more than once. And we make sure that if you are using an electronic voting system, that it is fully functioning and is going to accurately reflect the votes of the people who came and cast their ballot.BLITZER: Yes. But in Texas, the authorities say the tablet, the electronic voting machine, it is working fine, but people are -- some people are making some mistakes, human error, they say. They're not necessarily following the instructions that they get.But it's not big, they say. There's been a few problems like that. But they're not suggesting it's a big problem.DUFFY: And one other point on that, and will just -- these articles that I have read, I haven't verified them.But we heard the one of George Soros' companies has provided some of the machines for some of these states. And, obviously, Mr. Soros leans left. I haven't personally verified that yet.But, again, I think we want to make sure that these voting machines and systems are free of politics and policy, because this great American system, this election, is based on the trust of the American people. And I don't think we want to undermine that trust in our electoral process.BLITZER: We have to take a quick break.But it's Republican officials in Texas who are saying this is not a big problem with these voting tablets, if you will. And that George Soros issue, that is an unconfirmed rumor certainly that has spread out there. But we have not been able to confirm that, by any means, that the machines maybe that his company is building are designed to help Hillary Clinton and not Donald Trump, for that matter.That sounds conspiratorial.DUFFY: I agree.BLITZER: But let's take a quick break, Congressman. We will resume our coverage right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: We're back with Republican Congressman and Donald Trump supporter Sean Duffy.Congressman, I would like you to stand by for a moment.We're getting some new information about Vladimir Putin latest response to claims that Russia is attempting to influence the U.S. presidential election.Our chief national security correspondent, Jim Sciutto, is with us.Jim, Putin says it's all a ploy?JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: That's right.And it's interesting, because we have heard Donald Trump occasionally praise the leadership style of Vladimir Putin. Today, we heard Vladimir Putin, to some degree, defending Donald Trump's campaigning style, even making some points, expressing some talking points seemingly stolen from the Donald Trump playbook. Have a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Donald Trump behaves extravagantly. Of course, we see this. But I think there's a reason for this, because, in my opinion, he represents the interests of that part of society, and it is quite big in the United States, which is tired of the elite who have been in power for decades.(END VIDEO CLIP)SCIUTTO: Tired of the elite in power for decades. You heard Donald Trump say that about Hillary Clinton in the last debate.But on this issue who is behind these election hacks, of course Russia has denied that from the beginning. Vladimir Putin has denied that multiple times. But today he sort of jokingly dismissed the whole idea. Have a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PUTIN (through translator): Does anyone seriously think that Russia can in some way influence the choice the American people? Is America some kind of a banana republic? America is a great country. Correct me if I'm wrong.(END VIDEO CLIP)SCIUTTO: The could there went on to laugh at that a little bit there, this idea of America as a banana republic. But, again, the fact is, U.S. intelligence agencies, Department of Homeland Security took the rare step of naming and shaming Russia in public for these hacks, you will remember, Wolf, even saying it would have required the most senior levels of the Russian government, namely Vladimir Putin, to approve hacks like this.BLITZER: Jim Sciutto, thanks very much for that report.Let's get back to Congressman Sean Duffy.Congressman, your colleague Mike McCaul, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee and an adviser, a national security adviser, to Donald Trump, he says he told Trump Russia was behind these election hacks. Trump didn't think that was enough proof.[18:25:05]But Trump is also questioning his Republican colleagues and the intelligence community, for that matter, when generals as far as this ongoing fight against ISIS.When you hear all of this from Trump, how will he function if he's elected as president of the United States if he doesn't trust the intelligence community, for example?DUFFY: Well, just to take a side note, it's Barack Obama who has been changing the intelligence that is coming out of the Middle East to make it rosier to fit a narrative...(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: Hold on a second.Are you accusing the director of national intelligence, the CIA director, the NSA director, all 16, 17 intelligence agencies of being manipulated by the president of the United States for political reasons?DUFFY: No, what I'm saying is, and these are well-vetted stories about insiders who have provided intelligence reports about what's happening in the Middle East in Iraq, with Syria, and with Afghanistan, of modifying the reports that have come out of their intelligence...(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: Mike McCaul is a Republican. He's the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. He's from Texas. He's highly respected. Is he being manipulated as well?DUFFY: No, I didn't say that he was.I said that the mid-level folks that are writing reports on the ground reporting on our effectiveness in the Middle East on our policy against terror, those reports have been modified. And the people who have written reports have come forward and expressed that openly and publicly.Now, Mike McCaul is a friend of mine. He's a straight-shooting guy, but I think he's heard the same story. I'm not saying that these reports are wrong that are coming out about Russia. All I'm saying is, your question went to the point of, can you be an effective president if you have bad intelligence?Well, Mr. Obama, some would argue, has been an effective president, some would say he hasn't, but he also has had bad intelligence.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: No, no, I didn't say if he had intelligence. I said if he's not listening to the intelligence community and accepting their bottom-line assertions about what is going on, can you be an effective president if you don't pay attention to their conclusions?DUFFY: So, let's go to the point.I don't care if it's Russia, if it's the Tooth Fairy or the devil that provides this information. The bottom line is, we're seeing a pay- for-play scandal. You give money to the State Department or the Clinton Foundation, you get access to the Clinton State Department.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: Hold on, Congressman. Do you care if Russia is trying to interfere by hacking various e-mail accounts, DNC, Democratic National Committee, or other e-mail accounts associated with Democrats, do you care if they're trying to influence the American election system so that Trump is elected?DUFFY: What I would argue is, if -- do I care about that? Of course.But then if we have this information through the intelligence services of the United States of America, let's put it out there. Let's show how Russia is actually doing this.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: But you know, Congressman, sometimes, the intelligence community -- hold on a second. They have to protect what they call sources and methods. They can't necessarily reveal that kind of information, because it undermines national security.You're familiar with that.DUFFY: Sure, but there's a lot of sources and a lot of information they can release without releasing all of it and jeopardizing the tools that they use to get that information.But that aside, Wolf, I want to tell you that I don't think it helps Donald Trump at all to have any ties to Putin. If anyone thinks that Putin saying nice things about Donald Trump is helpful in this election, it's absolutely not. Mr. Putin is a thug. He's not a friend of ours.And I think anyone that cozies up or says nice things about Mr. Putin, I fundamentally disagree with. And the Russians are smart. If they're trying to help Donald Trump, why would Mr. Putin say nice things about Mr. Trump? Because he knows that that just stirs up a lot of anger within the American voting base.BLITZER: But what's intriguing to a lot of experts, and I'm sure it is to you, at least so far, all of the hacked e-mails, for example, have been damaging to the Democrats, not to the Republicans. So far, no Republican National Committee e-mails or Trump e-mails, for that matter, Trump campaign e-mails, have been hacked. Or at least they haven't been released.And that's why people are pointing to the Russians, by and large, and they're saying it's designed to undermine Hillary Clinton and the Democrats and help Trump. That's the argument.DUFFY: And I understand the argument, and I kind of look to what Marco Rubio said.I don't know that any of us like when e-mails are hacked. They should be private. But I would also note, Wolf, that there's a lot of serious things that are happening within Clinton world that have come out that give people great cause about her ability to serve effectively as the next president of the United States of America.We have issues of, again, corruption. The fact that she had this private server and didn't protect American top-secret information. The fact that she came to Congress and said she didn't have this secure information on her server, and then Mr. Comey came in and said no, actually, on that server, she did have top-secret information.[18:30:27] All of this is relevant, and I think it's important -- and I told you this before -- I want to know as much information about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. I want to know the good, the bad, and the ugly so I can make the best decision on November 8. And I think every American deserves that.And as you've seen from these e-mails, I wish that Hillary Clinton would have done what her staffers advised her: say ""I had a server."" Apologize for it. Put out the paid speeches to Wall Street. And don't Bleach Bit 33,000 e-mails. Put them out there. Be transparent.BLITZER: Congressman...DUFFY: And Wolf, if she did that, this wouldn't even be a race, I don't think. She would be walking away with it, because she was honest and transparent, and she asked for forgiveness; and Americans give forgiveness when you ask for it.BLITZER: Congressman, you make fair points on that issue, which is -- which is a fair issue for discussion, but it's a separate issue from whether or not Russia is deliberately releasing stolen or hacked e- mails in order to interfere in the American democratic election system. Those are two separate issues that we're discussing right now.DUFFY: They are.BLITZER: We'll continue these conversations down the road. Sean Duffy, the congressman from Wisconsin. Appreciate it very much.Just ahead, the First Ladies' Club, how Michelle Obama's pitch for Hillary Clinton could help.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MICHELLE OBAMA, FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES: For the past eight years, I have had the great honor of being this country's first lady. First ladies, we rock.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)[18:36:37] BLITZER: The breaking news this hour: Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama campaigning together for the first time.The first lady fired up a crowd in North Carolina, saying Clinton has more experience than anyone else to be president of the United States. Let's get some more with our political experts.We're here with Gloria Borger. Events like this, the star power, if you will, of Michelle Obama, is that what the Clinton campaign needs right now to prevent complacency?GLORIA BORGER, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST: Sure. Absolutely. I mean, let's just say that Michelle Obama gets the surrogate of the year award, because she can bring out the crowds. It was a very big crowd there today. I think the first or second largest of the year.And she not only can get people motivated to vote, but her message today was very clear. She said, they are trying to convince you to stay home, that they are -- their strategy is to make this election so ugly that you won't want any part of it.So she kind of hit the voter suppression issue right on the head, and said to voters, in that important state, which is close, ""You cannot stay home anymore."" And reminded people that, in the year 2008, when her husband won that state, it was by 14,000 votes, which is two per district.So she can really drive that message home. And other surrogates can do the same. If Hillary Clinton doesn't get them enthused, they will try.BLITZER: And David Swerdlick, a new Quinnipiac University poll out today from Quinnipiac in North Carolina. Look at this: Hillary Clinton 47 percent, Donald Trump 43 percent. Gary Johnson, 5 percent. If that poll is accurate, how does Trump catch up?DAVID SWERDLICK, ASSISTANT EDITOR, ""THE WASHINGTON POST"": I think Trump is really just, at this point, going to have to either stay on a couple of messages that seem to resonate for him, like the Obamacare premium numbers, talking about some of the core issues that matter to his voters like immigration.If he gets sidetracked on all the things he gets sidetracked on, I don't see how he makes it up in a national poll. I think he's got to concentrate also on the swing states. The national poll numbers are starting to mean less and less.BLITZER: He was very disciplined today in speeches so far, with another one coming up later in Ohio. Two other intriguing polls in Iowa. Hillary Clinton 44 percent, Trump 44 percent. A month ago, Hillary Clinton was down in Iowa by about seven points.And in Georgia, which is a traditionally red state in a presidential contest, Trump 44, Hillary Clinton 43 percent. She was down seven percent -- seven points a month ago in the same poll in Georgia, as well.It looks like that's a narrowing. If there's a narrowing in Georgia of all places, Trump is in trouble.RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Right, absolutely. I mean, look, we have seen in the national polling sort of a kind of a return to the mean a little bit in the last few days with the numbers coming down more into the range of where they have been for the most of the race. But both of these results, as well as North Carolina and theQuinnipiac, show the limits of that. There are two important points about these polls.First of all, neither of these are states that Hillary Clinton has to win in order to win. They are states that Donald Trump has to win to have any chance, and he is struggling in them.And the other thing that's really significant here, Wolf, is that these are states in each of the two baskets of the swing states. On the one hand, Iowa is probably the Rust Belt swing state where Donald Trump has had the best chance. It's a heavily blue collar, predominantly white state. And again, if the margin has fallen there, Hillary Clinton is ahead in this poll among college whites, it is difficult for him in the other Rust Belt swing states that are less amenable to him.And conversely, Georgia is really outside of the border of what we have thought of in the Sun Belt swing states. You have North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado, Nevada and Florida. Georgia is kind of like a step behind. And again, if that is competitive, it kind of tells you where you are in the other states. And in fact, in that Quinnipiac poll, she's up 12 points indeed.[18:35:26] BLITZER: Very interesting numbers, indeed.Olivia Nuzzi, it seems that the Trump campaign strategy now is to somehow decrease voter turnout for Hillary Clinton by raising all these issues, including these WikiLeaks e-mails that have been hacked.NUZZI: I mean, the strategy described in that Bloomberg story by Joshua Green today is like voter depression more than voter suppression. And it seems like they are desperate right now. They know that things aren't going well. As you said, Georgia is in play. Things are not going well in Texas of all places. They are desperate, and they are looking to do anything that they can to change the tide.BLITZER: Can they do that, Gloria?BORGER: See. I mean, we'll have to -- we'll have to see. I was talking to somebody in the Clinton campaign today who was saying, ""Look, they don't expect to win Georgia. They really don't.""But the question of North Carolina is interesting, because will North Carolina start to look more and more like the state of Virginia where they're ahead? Triangle. There are a lot of voters they believe that they can appeal to there. And that is a state that is changing, and so they're very interested, of course, because they want to win it.So they're very interested, of course, because they want to win it -- but they're very interested in the tightening of the polls there, vis- a-vis the state of Virginia, which isn't even -- isn't even endowed anymore.BROWNSTEIN: And Wolf, can I just add real quickly?BLITZER: Yes, go ahead.BROWNSTEIN: ... it's basically the same. In all of the Sun Belt states, you see the same coalition consolidating, accelerating what we've seen over the last 16 years, really, since 2000.In Virginia already, the combination of college-educated whites and minorities have tipped the state toward the Democrats. In the Quinnipiac poll, Hillary Clinton is up double digits among college whites. You combine that with the minority population of Virginia. It's not competitive.In North Carolina in this poll, she's basically even among college whites. And that is enough, given the minority population, to give her a slight advantage.But it puts North Carolina on the same continuum that we've seen in Virginia and Colorado. And if Democrats can sustain that through this election and beyond, it really does tilt the Electoral College map. Georgia and Arizona are one step behind with the same demographic mix. But just not quite as much Democratic strength with college whites yet.BLITZER: All right, guys. Stand by. We have much more coming up. More stolen Clinton campaign e-mails have just been revealed. Should Hillary Clinton ignore them or confront them head on?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)[18:47:26] WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: Hillary Clinton's campaign brought out one of its biggest stars, the First Lady Michelle Obama. She campaigned with the Democratic nominee today for the first time. Lots going on.Ron Brownstein, another aspect, very interesting, Congressman Jason Chaffetz of Utah, he's a Republican, after the ""Access Hollywood"" video came out, he said there's no way he could support Donald Trump. He rescinded his endorsement, but now, he says he'll actually vote for Donald Trump, even though he's not endorsing him or supporting him.Are Republicans out there sort of over all of the sexual allegations? Are they just ready to move on right now?RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: No. But I think what Congressman Chaffetz has done though shows kind of the incredibly difficult position they are in. Even with a number of Republicans recanting, I believe we are still at a point where more Republican elected officials have said they are not voting for this nominee than any other nominee in the party's history, including Barry Goldwater in 1964 and as I like to say, including even William Howard Taft after Theodore Roosevelt bolted the party in 1912 to start his Bull Moose Party. There are more Republican senators not voting for Trump than went with Roosevelt against Taft.But it reminds the big part of the Republican base is with him. And in fact, if he can -- when Donald Trump gets more generic, less kind of individual, and more like a generic Republican, as he has been in the last few days, he reminds a lot of ordinarily Republican leaning voters, in particular, college white men and non-college white women, where he has been significantly underperforming, he goes out every day and he talks about repealing Obamacare, they go, I'm a Republican, he's a Republican, his numbers start to move up. That's what I think we're seeing in the polls.So, it is a very difficult position for these elected officials. But there is still a bigger fracture in the party over Donald Trump than I believe over any previous nominee.BLITZER: Or when he talks about the Supreme Court and down that line (ph). Go ahead, David.DAVID SWERDLICK, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: One thing, I was just going to say, to me this is a profile in cowardice. The night the ""Access Hollywood"" tape came out, he didn't say ""I'm no longer endorsing Donald Trump,"" he said either ""I'm out"" or ""I'm no longer"", that was words to that effect.BLITZER: You're talking about Jason Chaffetz.SWERDLICK: Yes, talking about Congressman Chaffetz. I mean, he doesn't -- you know, people aren't at this point looking for him to make speeches on behalf of Donald Trump, or fundraiser on behalf of Trump, simply to know what his position is on Donald Trump, to reverse course on this after he gave that speech on TV, on our air, the night of that --BLITZER: Gloria, Utah is a significant state all of a sudden.GLORIA BORGER, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST: Oh, very significant state. I mean, who knows who is going to win Utah? Which -- I mean, no Democrat -- no Democrat has won Utah since Barry Goldwater.[18:50:00] So, you look at this and you understand, yes, Jason Chaffetz is in a tough position, but he went on Don Lemon that night, I think you and I were there and they set him out and he can't be back in again. And there is something to say -- look, I don't support him, I'm not going to vote for him, I'm not going to vote for him, but I'm not going to vote for Hillary Clinton.But you have to make that clear or how can your supporters know where your stand?BLITZER: Jason Chaffetz, Olivia, is not alone in this. There are other Republicans who say, I'm not going to endorse him, not going to support him, but I have to vote for him because I don't want Hillary Clinton to be president.OLIVIA NUZZI, THE DAILY BEAST: Right. But this is sort of Trump- vivation (ph) of the American politics, where people realize that they can pretty much get away with flip-flopping, they can get away with changing their minds and it may not matter because people do have short memories and people may not care that much in the end.I mean, if Donald Trump, the nominee, can get away with it, if you're Jason Chaffetz, maybe you think, well, why can't I get away with it, too?BLITZER: Is Melania Trump, you believe, is she going to actually go out and give two or three major speeches over the course of the next 12 days as Donald Trump suggested?BORGER: Well, Donald Trump seemed to surprise her when he said she was going to do it. I think if she does do it, it's going to be an indication that they believe that she can help with women. He has a significant gender gap and that they feel they need her there as a character witness. Spouses always are good character witnesses.The question is whether she's really going to be willing to do that, this campaign has not been something she's enjoyed. She's made it very clear. So, we'll have to see.BLITZER: Very quickly, Ron, would it make a difference?BROWNSTEIN: No, I don't think so. I mean, you know, look, your spouse should like you. And I think that's admirable but it's not really going to make a difference. He's facing some really significant problem with women voters, particularly college-educated white women who is on track to lose by two or three times as much as any Republican ever. And I don't think speeches from the spouse is going to change that.BLITZER: All right. Everybody, stay with me. We're going to continue our analysis.Also, there's other news developing. ISIS plots to attack the United States and that's adding new urgency to a looming military offensive on the terrorists' self-proclaimed capital.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)[18:56:51] BLITZER: ISIS plots to attack the United States are believed to be in the works right now in the terrorist self-proclaimed capital in Syria.Our Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr is working the story for us.Barbara, I understand you're learning, getting some new information?BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Indeed, Wolf, because of growing intelligence that ISIS is using Raqqah as a base of operations to plot against the United States. There are fresh indications the U.S. is getting ready to move on Raqqah.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)STARR (voice-over): Inside Raqqah's Syria, the U.S. believes terrorists are plotting to attack the U.S. and the Pentagon is trying to stop it.LT. GEN. STEPHEN TOWNSEND, COMMANDER, COMBINED JOINT TASK FORCE: There is I think a sense of urgency about what we have to do here, because we are just not sure what they're up to and where and when. But we know that this plot/planning is emanating from Raqqah.STARR: CNN has learned that U.S. Special Operations Forces recently attacked an ISIS target inside Syria. The U.S. believes the raid stopped plotters planning to attack the U.S., an administration official says.JOHN KIRBY, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN: We know we need to remove Daesh from Raqqah.STARR: There are 2,000 to 3,000 ISIS fighters in and around Raqqah, ISIS' self-declared capital, according to U.S. military officials. No one knows how many other supporters exist among the population.Within the next few weeks, the U.S. plans, along with Kurdish and Arab partners, to try to begin to isolate the city. Local ground forces backed up by U.S. military advisors will be put on roads in and out of Raqqah, trying to stop the flow of ISIS operatives.The U.S. will fly aircraft overhead, ready to strike when targets are identified. The fight for Raqqah will begin even if the fight to retake Mosul in Iraq grows more brutal.CNN producer Tim Lister is in northern Iraq.TIM LISTER, CNN PRODUCER: From the secret phone calls, the text messages, the firsthand accounts of escapees that we're getting, a picture is beginning to emerge. And it's one of increased defensive preparedness by ISIS with booby trapped bombs scattered across the whole neighborhoods, with vehicles suicide bombs being moved to the outskirts but also apparently a preparedness by ISIS to escape.STARR: People trapped in the city are trying to fight ISIS but as many as 600 have been rounded up.LISTER: The risk for anyone caught with a cell phone in Mosul is enormous, summary execution most of the time. But still, they try to get word out to the outside world.(END VIDEOTAPE)STARR: And tonight, U.S. officials are estimating upwards of 900 ISIS operatives have been killed so far in that operation against Mosul, Iraq -- Wolf.BLITZER: Barbara Starr with the latest information at the Pentagon.

Seroussi’s study showed a mantle plume pushes 150 milliwatts per square meter of heat up towards the ice sheet. That’s about two to three times the heat flux of regions of the world without volcanic activity.A 2014 University of Texas study found western Antarctica was a literal hotbed for geothermal heat. Researchers concluded that “large areas at the base of Thwaites Glacier are actively melting in response to geothermal flux consistent with rift-associated magma migration and volcanism.”The following year, a team of U.S. scientists confirmed in a study, the large amount of geothermal heat beneath the ice sheet, “The high geothermal heat flux may help to explain why ice streams and subglacial lakes are so abundant and dynamic in this region,” the study found.0	1.0

Here was the offending tweet:Schilling deleted the tweet after blowback. ESPN released a statement upon suspending Schilling:Curt’s tweet was completely unacceptable, and in no way represents our company’s perspective. We made that point very strongly to Curt and have removed him from his current Little League assignment pending further consideration.The tweet was offensive – to radical Muslims. Factually speaking, there were approximately 6.5 million formal members of the Nazi Party in 1940, out of a total German population of well over 80 million – a little over 8 percent. That number of members did not fully represent the level of support for the Nazi regime in Germany in 1940, of course.The same is true in the radicalized Muslim community. A very small percentage of Muslims globally are formal members of terror groups; it is difficult to estimate precise numbers due to secrecy, although their total membership runs into the hundreds of thousands (the Iranian Revolutionary Guard alone has 120,000 members, and some estimates have placed the ISIS membership at above 200,00).That terrorist membership is the tip of the iceberg: as I have written before, a huge percentage of worldwide Muslims are radicalized. If you calculate the number of Muslims globally who (1) believe that 9/11 was not committed by Muslims; (2) think that shariah law ought to be implemented; (3) support terrorist attacks; or (4) have a positive or neutral attitude toward ISIS, Hamas, Hezbollah, Osama Bin Laden or any other terrorist group or terrorist, the number calculates out to well above 800 million radicalized Muslims.PolitiFact’s ridiculous attempts to counter these calculations – cherry-picking their own, far narrower standard of radicalization — led them to the awkward position that 19 percent of Muslims in various countries, including the West, are radicalized (some 182 million Muslims worldwide).As Schilling wrote, the math is staggering when you get to true numbers.But ESPN has no interest in true numbers, because true numbers are awkward. Unsurprisingly, ESPN refused to explain why Schilling’s tweet was unacceptable. Is it because radicalized Muslims are somehow better than Germans who weren’t formal Nazi Party members? Is it because the genocidal Iranian regime or the barbarians of ISIS are somehow less objectionable than the Nazis themselves?It is worth noting that Schiling did not say that all Muslims should be tarred with the terrorist brush, any more than all Germans should have been tarred with the Nazi brush. The point of his tweet, to anyone with a functioning prefrontal cortex, is obvious: a small, brutal percentage of a larger, partially supportive population can do tremendous harm. That’s inarguable.Fortunately, ESPN doesn’t have to argue with Schilling or anyone else. They simply suspended Schilling, without any real rationale (by way of comparison, they did not suspend frequent ESPN guest Kevin Blackistone for calling the “Star-Spangled Banner” a “war anthem” on their airwaves). And the compliant media breath a sigh of relief, having made the world safer for those offended by tweets – and more ignorant of the threat of radical Islam.Ben Shapiro is Senior Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News and The New York Times bestselling author, most recently, of the book, The People vs. Barack Obama : The Criminal Case Against The Obama Administration (Threshold Editions, June 10, 2014).

http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2013/jan/25/mike-ryan/do-police-automatically-return-guns-someone-after-/	"	People committed involuntarily for 72 hours under the Baker Act will get their guns back ""automatically and immediately upon discharge....and their commitment is never entered into a background check database."""	mtrue	['Guns', 'Health Care']	http://www.browardbeat.com/	http://www.browardbeat.com/ryan-building-consensus-to-stop-gun-violence/	2013/01/25	BY MIKE RYAN As a Mayor of a town with 90,000 residents, thousands of businesses, 11 public schools, and millions of visitors a year, I have a very keen interest in preventing gun violence where possible. As a former PTA president and father of two in our Broward County Public Schools, I have a very personal interest in protecting our children and schools.Sunrise is also home to the only public recreational shooting range in Broward County. We welcome, and have enjoyed a positive relationship with, responsible gun owners – those who are interested in recreational and competitive shooting are friends, neighbors, visitors and residents.Last Friday, Sheriff Scott Israel hosted a Roundtable convened by Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz regarding gun violence. Attending were predominantly law enforcement chiefs, but also School Boards of Miami Dade County and Broward, a judge handling mental health issues, a prosecutor handling exclusively gang violence and gun crimes, a former ATF agent, a current FDLE agent, and the Mayors of Miami-Dade County and Broward County.In talking to responsible gun owners, law enforcement and residents, there is an evolving consensus: We must take whatever reasonable steps we can to prevent guns being placed in the hands of the irresponsible, derangedand criminals.This is not simply a reaction to a single event or a series of sensational events. In America, each day, there are 33 murders committed with guns.There is no single solution. That does not mean we should do nothing. We should have: School Resource Officers to play an important role in protecting our children and teachers – not as armed guards, but as part of the community-policing model meant to understand the dynamics of students and families and how they interact in and out of our schools. In addition to deterrence, they help address problems of drugs, gangs, and issues facing our neighborhoods and at-risk youth. In Sunrise, SROs have been or are active members of SWAT, Field Force, Hostage Negotiators and other specialized units – while still being able to open the milk carton for a frustrated 1stgrader or help a parent navigate the car loop.Universal background checks on ALL sales, with meaningful enforcement and real penalties for violators.Background checks that are meaningful.Full prosecution of anyone breaking existing laws.Severely increase penalties for crimes committed with guns.Ways to address the mentally ill and those with mental health issues. Now someone committed involuntarily for 72 hours under the “Baker Act” (as a danger to themselves or others) will have their guns returned to them by the police automatically and immediately upon discharge after 72 hours AND their commitment is never entered into a background check database. As a result, there is also no impediment or second thought given to someone being released and purchasing a gun.Penalties for the possession of a firearm obtained without a background check. If you shouldn’t have the gun, responsible gun owners say throw away the key. How we get there is part of the discussion.Roughly 6.6 million guns-a-year are transferred without background checks, many through the internet. Right now, private sellers exclusively decide whether or not they should seek a background check. That is unworkable and an illogical step to curb the flow of guns into the hands of the irresponsible, deranged and criminals.A March shooting rampage in New Mexico occurred after someone who would never have been able to pass a background check purchased guns privately, through an ad in the paper. The seller later admitted how badly he felt. The same scenario happened in a Wisconsin mass shooting last year involving an act of domestic violence. How many other times a day does this happen?We must make sure databases are populated with the right information on domestic violence history, convictions, mental health issues AND the state databases are linked to federal databases.Databases do prevent “bad guys” from getting guns. In 2009, over 150,000 were prohibited from purchasing. Since 1999, 1.7 million have been prohibited from buying guns from federally licensed dealers.But, gaps have let felons, those with domestic violence convictions and restraining orders and the mentally ill to actually obtain guns and permits to carry a concealed firearm.At Virginia Tech, the mass shooting was committed by someone who passed a background check even though a judge had found him mentally ill and ordered he not be permitted to purchase or possess a gun. The information was never linked to the necessary databases. How many times a day does this happen?All this means increased resources for enforcement and prosecutions, as well as a change in law to make the penalties severe enough that criminals, unscrupulous dealers, law enforcement and federal prosecutors take this seriously.The raging national debate over “bans” and restrictions on the character of guns and magazines are more difficult. Licensed dealers and law enforcement tell me since the Sandy Hook mass shooting, you cannot even find certain “military style” weapons to purchase…or the prices have skyrocketed.It is true so many of the murders committed each day involve weapons not even contemplated by any proposed “ban” or not involving high capacity magazines. So, some solutions should be implemented without even tackling the thorny issues presented.However, many in law enforcement said limiting high capacity magazines would make a difference over time regarding dangers they face and in many of these shootings. Mark Kelly emphasized this point last week in an interview; his wife Gabrielle Giffords was shot when the killer was stopped as he attempted to reload after emptying 30 rounds from a magazine. Sure, they can just reload. But, for the untrained particularly, reloading is a point where intervention can occur or where mechanical failure can impede. Some question why any civilian needs 30 round or more capacity.We must take the steps we all agree will make a difference. Doing nothing is not an option. Becoming paralyzed by politics will cost lives. Mike Ryan, the mayor of Sunrise, is also Chair of the Broward League of Cities Public Safety Committee and the Co-Chair of the Joint SRO Taskforce of the Broward League of Cities. 	1.0
http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2016/mar/24/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-accurately-touts-record-raw-turnout-in/	"Texas ""had the highest level of turnout than ever before in the primary."""	mtrue	['Elections']	http://kut.org/	http://kut.org/post/abbott-rejects-obama-criticism-texas-voter-turnout-efforts	2016/03/24	1:33KUT's Syeda Hasan reports“What I find is that leaders of the other party are against efforts to crack down on voter fraud,” Abbott said. “The fact is that voter fraud is rampant. In Texas, unlike some other states and unlike some other leaders, we are committed to cracking down on voter fraud.”In an interview with the Texas Tribune CEO and Editor-in-Chief Evan Smith on Friday, Obama said that leaders in Texas are partly to blame for low voter turnout in the state.“The folks who are governing the good state of Texas aren't interested in having more people participate,” Obama said.Obama has been previously critical of Voter ID laws like the one Texas passed in 2011. A federal judge ruled last year that the Texas law had a “discriminatory effect” by restricting access to the polls for black and Hispanic Texans. Last week the full U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals announced that it would hear arguments over whether the law violates the Voting Rights Act. The law requires most citizens to show one of a handful of forms of allowable photo identification before their election ballots can be counted.One specific policy that Obama suggested the state should adopt to increase turnout would be online voter registration. But Abbott appeared uninterested in the proposal when asked about it at a press conference following the announcement that California-based Pegasus Foods is building a new, 80,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Rockwall, Texas.“We don’t want to open the system up to methodologies or ways of voting that would promote or allow voter fraud,” Abbott said. “To the contrary to the president’s comment, the fact is — despite our voter registration laws — we had the highest level of turnout than ever before in the primary that occurred just a few weeks before he made that comment.”While Texas did witness historic voter turnout in the 2016 primaries, the state still had one of the lowest voting-age participation rates of the states that have held primaries so far at 21.5 percent, besting only Louisiana as of last week. But Abbott did not attribute those figures to the state’s election laws, instead pointing to the lack of faith in government among voters.“Voters and citizens repeatedly say, ‘Why go vote if we’re going to have corrupt leaders in office?’” Abbott said. “So we need to root out and eliminate corrupt leaders and root out and eliminate corruption in the voting process, and that means greater ballot security, not less ballot security.”Abbott noted that he personally prosecuted voter fraud cases “across the entire state of Texas” while he was the state's attorney general from 2002 to 2015.As U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey, pointed out last year in light of the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act,Voter fraud remains by many accounts a rare phenomenon in Texas.“You're more likely to get struck by lightning in Texas than to find any kind of voter fraud,”U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey, said last year, an assertion that PolitiFact found to be true. As of last year, there had been a total of 85 election fraud prosecutions resolved in Texas, including 51 guilty or no contest pleas and 9 convictions, according to PolitiFact. Lorraine Minnite, a Rutgers professor and author of the book The Myth of Voter Fraud, determined that four cases in Texas from 2000 to 2014 involved in-person voter fraud.Tags: 	1.0

Early this morning, the analytics arm of the search giant said it had seen a huge jump in the search term.However, analysis shows the question only started to rise as the polls were closing and had been relatively flat in the week running up to the vote.On Twitter, Google Trends wrote: +250 per cent spike in what happens if we leave the EU in the past hour.The search result is expected given the complex arrangement of the EU, with many keen to know how agreements affecting trade and the UK's commitments as a member state will be unpicked as the UK leaves.In the weeks and months running up to the vote, many criticised the deluge of information coming from the opposing camps, as well as industry leaders, economists, scientists and celebrities all voicing their support.At the start of the month, Conservative MP and 'vote leave' advocate Michael Gove said: 'I think people in this country have had enough of experts,' speaking in response to the claims of a expert consensus cited by the 'remain' campaign.RELATED ARTICLESPrevious1NextBREAKING NEWS: David Cameron QUITS as Prime Minister and the...Facebook Live set for Snapchat style video filters - and...'Should we stay or should we go?'

Google Trends recorded a spike in activity in people searching for 'What happens if we leave the EU?' after the polls had closed But in the week leading up to the vote this activity was largely flat But the top question across the UK concerning the EU referendum is What is Brexit? referring to the term coined for Britain's exit from the EU. The initial fallout from the referendum has shown a drop in the value of Sterling, with more than 100 billion wiped from the FTSE 100 this morning as stock markets reacted to the result. Prime Minister David Cameron has also announced he will be stepping down following the defeat of the remain campaign. But beyond these initial events, it could take a while for the full scale of the UK's decision to become apparent. Earlier in the month, the top search terms were immigration, NHS, economy, sovereignty and national security. But the question most people across the UK were asking was What is Brexit?, referring to the term coined for Britain's exit from the EU (pictured) An interactive heat map of search terms in the run up to the referendum showed more people were searching for leave in built up metropolitan areas (pictured)Search analysis in the run up to the vote revealed that more people were searching for 'leave' in metropolitan areas, but rather than an indication of voter preference, it could have been explained by people searching for the more information into the potential impact of a British exit from the EU.The final count of the UK vote showed 72.2 per cent of the population cast their vote, with 51.9 per cent voting to leave the EU.A total of 48.1 per cent of voters opted to remain in the EU, with the greatest proportion in London, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Tim Kaine and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence met face-to-face for the first time Tuesday night, as the running mates took part in the only vice-presidential debate of the 2016 election. The debate came amid Kaine and Hillary Clinton's newfound momentum in the race and as the Trump-Pence campaign continues to find itself on its heels -- due to a poor Trump debate performance last week and basically everything that has happened since. We've posted the complete transcript below, along with our annotations of the key moments, fact checks and other commentary. To see an annotation, click on the highlighted text.

From Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia, and welcome to the first, and only, vice presidential debate of 2016, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. QUIJANO: I'm Elaine Quijano, anchor at CBSN, and correspondent for CBS News. It's an honor to moderate this debate between Senator Tim Kaine and Governor Mike Pence. Both are longtime public servants who are also proud fathers of sons serving in the U.S. Marines. The campaigns have agreed to the rules of this 90-minute debate. There will be nine different segments covering domestic and foreign policy issues. Each segment will begin with a question to both candidates who will each have two minutes to answer. Then I'll ask follow-up questions to facilitate a discussion between the candidates. By coin toss, it's been determined that Senator Kaine will be first to answer the opening question. QUIJANO: We have an enthusiastic audience tonight. They've agreed to only express that enthusiasm once at the end of the debate and right now as we welcome Governor Mike Pence and Senator Tim Kaine. Gentlemen, welcome. It truly is a privilege to be with both of you tonight. QUIJANO: I'd like to start with the topic of presidential leadership. Twenty-eight years ago tomorrow night, Lloyd Bentsen said the vice presidential debate was not about the qualifications for the vice presidency, but about how if tragedy should occur, the vice president has to step in without any margin for error, without time for preparation, to take over the responsibility for the biggest job in the world. What about your qualities, your skills, and your temperament equip you to step into that role at a moment's notice? Senator Kaine? KAINE: Elaine, thank you for being here tonight, and, Governor Pence, welcome. It is so great to be back at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia. This is a very special place. Sixty-five years ago, a young, courageous woman, Barbara Johns, led a walkout of her high school, Moton High School. She made history by protesting school segregation. She believed our nation was stronger together. And that walkout led to the Brown v. Board of Education decision that moved us down the path toward equality. I am so proud to be running with another strong, history-making woman, Hillary Clinton, to be president of the United States. I'm proud because her vision of stronger together, building an economy that works for all, not just those at the top, being safe in the world not only with a strong military, but also strong alliances to battle terrorism and climate change, and also to build a community of respect, just like Barbara Johns tried to do 65 years ago. That's why I'm so proud to be her running mate. Hillary told me why she asked me to be her running mate. She said the test of a Clinton administration will not be the signing of a bill or the passage of a bill. It'll be whether we can make somebody's life better, whether we can make a classroom better learning environment for schoolkids or teachers, whether we can make a safer -- it's going to be about results. And she said to me, you've been a missionary and a civil rights lawyer. You've been a city councilman and mayor. You've been a lieutenant governor and governor and now a U.S. senator. I think you will help me figure out how to govern this nation so that we always keep in mind that the success of the administration is the difference we make in people's lives. And that's what I bring to the ticket, that experience having served at all levels of government. But my primary role is to be Hillary Clinton's right-hand person and strong supporter as she puts together the most historic administration possible. And I relish that role. I'm so proud of her. KAINE: I'll just say this: We trust Hillary Clinton, my wife and I, and we trust her with the most important thing in our life. We have a son deployed overseas in the Marine Corps right now. We trust Hillary Clinton as president and commander-in-chief, but the thought of Donald Trump as commander-in-chief scares us to death. QUIJANO: Governor Pence? PENCE: Well, first off, thank you, Elaine, and thank you to -- thank you to Norwood University for their wonderful hospitality and the Commission on Presidential Debates. It's deeply humbling for me to be here, to be surrounded by my -- my wonderful family. And, Senator Kaine, it's an honor to be here with you, as well. And I just -- I also want to say -- I want to say thanks to everyone that's looking in tonight, who understands what an enormously important time this is in the life of our nation. For the last seven-and-a-half years, we've seen America's place in the world weakened. We've seen an economy stifled by more taxes, more regulation, a war on coal, and a failing health care reform come to be known as Obamacare, and the American people know that we need to make a change. And so I want to thank all of you for being -- being with us tonight. PENCE: I also want to thank Donald Trump for making that call and inviting us to be a part of this ticket. I have to tell you, I'm a -- I'm a small-town boy from a place not too different from Farmville. I grew up with a cornfield in my backyard. My grandfather had immigrated to this country when he was about my son's age. My mom and dad built a -- everything that matters in a small town in Southern Indiana. They built a family and -- and a good name and a business. And they raised a family. And I dreamed some day of representing my home town in Washington, D.C., but I -- honestly, Elaine, I never imagined -- never imagined I'd have the opportunity to be governor of the state that I love, let alone be sitting at a table like this in this kind of a position. So to answer your question, I would say I -- I would hope that if -- if the responsibility ever fell to me in this role, that I would meet it with the way that I'm going to meet the responsibility should I be elected vice president of the United States. And that's to bring a lifetime of experience, a lifetime growing up in a small town, a lifetime where I've served in the Congress of the United States, where -- where I've led a state that works in the great state of Indiana, and whatever other responsibilities might follow from this, I -- I would hope and, frankly, I would pray to be able to meet that moment with that -- that lifetime of experience. QUIJANO: Senator Kaine, on the campaign trail, you praised Secretary Clinton's character, including her commitment to public service, yet 60 percent of voters don't think she's trustworthy. Why do so many people distrust her? Is it because they have questions about her e-mails and the Clinton Foundation? KAINE: Elaine, let me tell you why I trust Hillary Clinton. Here's what people should look at as they look at a public servant. Do they have a passion in their life that showed up before they were in public life? And have they held onto that passion throughout their life, regardless of whether they were in office or not, succeeding or failing? Hillary Clinton has that passion. From a time as a kid in a Methodist youth group in the suburbs of Chicago, she has been focused on serving others with a special focus on empowering families and kids. As a civil rights lawyer in the South, with the Children's Defense Fund, first lady of Arkansas and this country, senator, secretary of state, it's always been about putting others first. And that's a sharp contrast with Donald Trump. Donald Trump always puts himself first. He built a business career, in the words of one of his own campaign staffers, ""off the backs of the little guy."" And as a candidate, he started his campaign with a speech where he called Mexicans rapists and criminals, and he has pursued the discredited and really outrageous lie that President Obama wasn't born in the United States. It is so painful to suggest that we go back to think about these days where an African-American could not be a citizen of the United States. And I can't imagine how Governor Pence can defend the insult- driven selfish ""me first"" style of Donald Trump. QUIJANO: Governor Pence, let me ask you, you have said Donald Trump is, quote, ""thoughtful, compassionate, and steady."" Yet 67 percent of voters feel he is a risky choice, and 65 percent feel he does not have the right kind of temperament to be president. Why do so many Americans think Mr. Trump is simply too erratic? PENCE: Well, let me -- let me say first and foremost that, Senator, you and Hillary Clinton would know a lot about an insult- driven campaign. It really is remarkable. At a time when literally, in the wake of Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, where she was the architect of the Obama administration's foreign policy, we see entire portions of the world, particularly the wider Middle East, literally spinning out of control. I mean, the situation we're watching hour by hour in Syria today is the result of the failed foreign policy and the weak foreign policy that Hillary Clinton helped lead in this administration and create. The newly emboldened -- the aggression of Russia, whether it was in Ukraine or now they're heavy-handed approach... KAINE: You guys love Russia. You both have said... PENCE: ... their heavy-handed approach. KAINE: You both have said -- you both have said Vladimir Putin is a better leader than the president. QUIJANO: Well, we're going to get to Russia in just a moment. But I do want to get back to the question at... PENCE: But in the midst -- Elaine, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Senator, I'll... KAINE: These guys have praised Vladimir Putin as a great leader. How can that... QUIJANO: Yes, and we will get to that, Senator. We do have that coming up here. But in the meantime, the questions... PENCE: Well, Senator, I must have hit a... PENCE: I must have hit a nerve here. QUIJANO: Why the disconnect? PENCE: Because at a time of great challenge in the life of this nation, where we've weakened America's place in the world, stifled America's economy, the campaign of Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine has been an avalanche of insults. Look, to get to your question about trustworthiness, Donald Trump has built a business through hard times and through good times. He's brought an extraordinary business acumen. He's employed tens of thousands of people in this country. KAINE: And paid few taxes and lost a billion a year. QUIJANO: And why the disconnect with your running mate? PENCE: But there's a -- there's a reason why people question the trustworthiness of Hillary Clinton. And that's because they're paying attention. I mean, the reality is, when she was secretary of state, Senator, come on. She had a Clinton Foundation accepting contributions from foreign governments. KAINE: You are Donald Trump's apprentice. Let me talk about this... PENCE: Senator, I think I'm still on my time. KAINE: Well, I think -- isn't this a discussion? QUIJANO: This is our open discussion. KAINE: Yeah, let's talk about the state of... PENCE: Well, let me interrupt -- let me interrupt you and finish my sentence, if I can. KAINE: Finish your sentence. PENCE: The Clinton Foundation accepted foreign contributions from foreign governments and foreign donors while she was secretary of state. KAINE: OK, now I can weigh in. Now... PENCE: She had a private server... KAINE: Now, I get to weigh in. Now, let me just say this... PENCE: ... that was discovered... QUIJANO: ... Senator, you have an opportunity to respond. PENCE: ... keep that pay to play process out of the reach of the public. KAINE: Governor Pence -- Governor Pence doesn't think the world's going so well and he, you know, is going to say it's everybody's fault. KAINE: Let me tell you this. When Hillary Clinton became secretary of state, Governor Pence, did you know that Osama bin Laden was alive? KAINE: Do you know that we had 175,000 troops deployed in the battlefield in Iraq and Afghanistan? Do you know that Iran was racing toward a nuclear weapon and Russia was expanding its stockpile? Under Secretary Clinton's leadership, she was part of the national team, public safety team that went after and revived the dormant hunt against bin Laden and wiped him off the face of the Earth. She worked to deal with the Russians to reduce their chemical weapons stockpile. She worked a tough negotiation with nations around the world to eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program without firing a shot. PENCE: Eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program? KAINE: Absolutely, without firing a shot. And instead of 175,000 American troops deployed overseas, we now have 15,000. KAINE: These are very, very good things. PENCE: And Iraq has been overrun by ISIS, because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate... KAINE: Well, if you want to put more American troops in Iraq, you can propose that. PENCE: Hillary Clinton -- Hillary Clinton -- Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement... KAINE: No, that is incorrect. That's incorrect. PENCE: And so we removed -- we removed all of our... QUIJANO: Gentlemen, we'll get to... PENCE: ... troops from Iraq, and ISIS was able to be conjured up in that vacuum. KAINE: But I'd like to correct... PENCE: ... and overrun vast areas of Iraq. KAINE: Governor, President Bush said we would leave Iraq at the end of 2011. And, Elaine, Iraq didn't want our troops to stay, and they wouldn't give us the protection for our troops. And guess what? If a nation where our troops are serving does not want us to stay, we're not going to stay without their protection. PENCE: It was a failure of the secretary of state... QUIJANO: We need to move on to the next topic, gentlemen. KAINE: If Governor Pence wants to put more troops back in Iraq, that's... QUIJANO: There are a lot of people wondering in this country about the economy. Let's turn to the issue of the economy. QUIJANO: According to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, neither of your economic plans will reduce the growing $19 trillion gross national debt. In fact, your plans would add even more to it. Both of you were governors who balanced state budgets. Are you concerned that adding more to the debt could be disastrous for the country. Governor Pence? PENCE: I think the fact that -- that under this past administration was of which Hillary Clinton was a part, we've almost doubled the national debt is atrocious. I mean, I'm very proud of the fact that -- I come from a state that works. The state of Indiana has balanced budgets. We cut taxes, we've made record investments in education and in infrastructure, and I still finish my term with $2 billion in the bank. That's a little bit different than when Senator Kaine was governor here in Virginia. He actually -- he actually tried to raise taxes by about $4 billion. He left his state about $2 billion in the hole. In the state of Indiana, we've cut unemployment in half; unemployment doubled when he was governor. PENCE: But I think he's a very fitting running mate for Hillary Clinton, because in the wake of a season where American families are struggling in this economy under the weight of higher taxes and Obamacare and the war on coal and the stifling avalanche of regulation coming out of this administration, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same. It really is remarkable that they actually are advocating a trillion dollars in tax increases, which I get that. You tried to raise taxes here in Virginia and were unsuccessful. But a trillion dollars in tax increases, more regulation, more of the same war on coal, and more of Obamacare that now even former President Bill Clinton calls Obamacare a crazy plan. But Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to build on Obamacare. They want to expand it into a single-payer program. And for all the world, Hillary Clinton just thinks Obamacare is a good start. Look, Donald Trump and I have a plan to get this economy moving again just the way that it worked in the 1980s, just the way it worked in the 1960s, and that is by lowering taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms, ending the war on coal that is hurting jobs and hurting this economy even here in Virginia, repealing Obamacare lock, stock, and barrel, and repealing all of the executive orders that Barack Obama has signed that are stifling economic growth in this economy. We can get America moving again. Put on top of that the kind of trade deals that'll put the American worker first, and you've got a prescription for real growth. And when you get the economy growing, Elaine, that's when you can deal with the national debt. When we get back to 3.5 percent to 4 percent growth with Donald Trump's plan will do, then we're going to have the resources to meet our nation's needs at home and abroad, and we're going to have the ability to bring down the national debt. QUIJANO: Senator Kaine? KAINE: Elaine, on the economy, there's a fundamental choice for the American electorate. Do you want a ""you're hired"" president in Hillary Clinton or do you want a ""you're fired"" president in Donald Trump? I think that's not such a hard choice. Hillary and I have a plan that's on the table that's a ""you're hired"" plan. Five components. First thing we do is we invest in manufacturing, infrastructure, and research in the clean energy jobs of tomorrow. Second thing is we invest in our workforce, from pre-K education to great teachers to debt-free college and tuition-free college for families that make less than $125,000 a year. Third, we promote fairness by raising the minimum wage, so you can't work full-time and be under the poverty level, and by paying women equal pay for equal work. Fourth, we promote small business growth, just as we've done in Virginia, to make it easier to start and grow small businesses. Hillary and I each grew up in small-business families. My dad, who ran an iron working and welding shop, is here tonight. And, fifth, we have a tax plan that targets tax relief to middle- class individuals and small businesses and asks those at the very top who've benefited as we've come out of recession to pay more. KAINE: The Trump plan is a different plan. It's a ""you're fired"" plan. And there's two key elements to it. First, Donald Trump said wages are too high. And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage. Mike Pence, when he was in Congress, voted against raising the minimum wage above $5.15. And he has been a one-man bulwark against minimum wage increases in Indiana. The second component of the plan is massive tax breaks for the very top, trillions of dollars of tax breaks for people just like Donald Trump. The problem with this, Elaine, is that's exactly what we did 10 years ago and it put the economy into the deepest recession -- the deepest recession since the 1930s. Independent analysts say the Clinton plan would grow the economy by 10.5 million jobs. The Trump plan would cost 3.5 million jobs. And Donald Trump -- why would he do this? Because his tax plan basically helps him. And if he ever met his promise and he gave his tax returns to the American public like he said he would, we would see just how much his economic plan is really a Trump-first plan. QUIJANO: On that point, Governor Pence, recently the New York Times released part of Mr. Trump's 1995 tax return and reported that he could have avoided paying federal income taxes for years. Yesterday, Mr. Trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible. Does that seem fair to you? PENCE: Well, first, let me say, I appreciated the ""you're hired,"" ""you're fired"" thing, Senator. You use that a whole lot. And I think your running mate used a lot of pre-done lines. Look, what -- what you all just heard out there is more taxes, $2 trillion in more spending, more deficits, more debt, more government. And if you think that's all working, then you look at the other side of the table. I mean, the truth of the matter is, the policies of this administration, which Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine want to continue, have run this economy into a ditch. We're in the... KAINE: Fifteen million new jobs? PENCE: ... slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression. KAINE: Fifteen million new jobs? QUIJANO: Governor... PENCE: There are millions more people living in poverty today than the day that Barack Obama with Hillary Clinton at his side... KAINE: And the poverty level and the median income... PENCE: ... stepped into the Oval Office. KAINE: ... improved dramatically between 2014 and 2015. PENCE: You -- honestly, Senator, you can roll out the numbers and the sunny side, but I got to tell you, people in Scranton know different. People in Fort Wayne, Indiana, know different. I mean, this economy is struggling. The answer to this economy is not more taxes. KAINE: But it's not the giveaway tax relief to the folks at the top. PENCE: It's not more spending... KAINE: I am interested to hear whether he'll defend his running mate's not releasing taxes and not paying taxes. PENCE: Absolutely I will. QUIJANO: Governor, with all due respect, the question was about whether it seems fair to you that Mr. Trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible. PENCE: Well, this is probably the difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine. And, I mean, Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine -- God bless you for it, career public servants, that's great -- Donald Trump is a businessman, not a career politician. He actually built a business. Those tax returns that were -- that came out publicly this week show that he faced some pretty tough times 20 years ago. But like virtually every other business, including the New York Times not too long ago, he used what's called net operating loss. We have a tax code, Senator, that actually is designed to encourage entrepreneurship in this country. KAINE: But why won't he release his tax returns? PENCE: Well, we're answering the question about -- about a business thing, is he... KAINE: I do want to come back to that, but... PENCE: His tax returns -- his tax returns showed he went through a very difficult time, but he used the tax code just the way it's supposed to be used. And he did it brilliantly. KAINE: How do you know that? You haven't seen his tax returns. PENCE: He created a runway -- because he's created a business that's worth billions of dollars today. KAINE: How do you know that? PENCE: And with regard to paying taxes, this whole riff about not paying taxes and people saying he didn't pay taxes for years, Donald Trump has created tens of thousands of jobs. And he's paid payroll taxes, sales taxes, property taxes... KAINE: Elaine, let me talk about something. QUIJANO: Senator, I'm going to give you about 30 seconds to respond, and I have question on Social Security for you. PENCE: The only issue on taxes -- Hillary Clinton is going to raise taxes, and Donald Trump and I are going to cut them. KAINE: Donald Trump started this campaign in 2014 and he said, ""If I run for president, I will absolutely release my taxes."" He's broken his first... KAINE: He's broken his first promise. Second, he stood on the stage... PENCE: He hasn't broken his promise. He said he's... KAINE: He stood on the stage last week and when Hillary said, you haven't been paying taxes, he said, ""That makes me smart."" So it's smart not to pay for our military? It's smart not to pay for veterans? It's smart not to pay for teachers? And I guess all of us who do pay for those things, I guess we're stupid. And the last thing I'll say is this... PENCE: Senator, do you take all the deductions that you're entitled to? KAINE: The last thing -- the last thing I want to ask Governor Pence is... KAINE: Governor Pence had to give Donald Trump his tax returns to show he was qualified to be vice president. Donald Trump must give the American public his tax returns to show that he's qualified to be president. And he's breaking his promise. PENCE: Elaine, I have to respond to this. QUIJANO: You get very little time, 20 seconds. PENCE: I'll be -- I'll be very respectful. PENCE: Look, Donald Trump has filed over 100 pages of financial disclosure, which is what the law requires. KAINE: But he said he would release his tax returns. QUIJANO: All right, Gentlemen... PENCE: The American people can review that. And he's going -- Senator, he's going to release his tax returns when the audit is over... QUIJANO: ... I need to ask you about Social Security... KAINE: Richard Nixon released tax returns when he was under audit. PENCE: They're going to raise your taxes. We're going to cut your taxes. QUIJANO: Gentlemen... KAINE: If you can't meet Nixon's standard... QUIJANO: The people at home cannot understand either one of you when you speak over each other. I would please ask you to wait until it is that the other is finished. KAINE: All right. We're having fun up here. QUIJANO: Senator Kaine, on the issue of Social Security, in 18 years, when the Social Security Trust Funds run out of money, you'll be 76. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates your benefits could be cut by as much as $7,500 per year. What would your administration do to prevent this cut? KAINE: First, we're going to protect Social Security, which is one of the greatest programs that the American government has ever done. It happened at a time when you would work your whole life, your whole life, raising your kids, working, being a Little League coach or a Sunday school teacher, and then you would retire into poverty. And Social Security has enabled people to retire with dignity and overwhelmingly not be in poverty. We have to keep it solvent. And we will keep it solvent. And we'll look for strategies like adjusting the payroll tax cap upward in order to do that. Here's what Hillary and I will not do. And I want to make this very plain. We will never, ever engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security. Donald Trump wrote a book and he said Social Security is a Ponzi scheme and privatization would be good for all of us. And when Congressman Pence was in Congress, he was the chief cheerleader for the privatization of Social Security. Even after President Bush stopped pushing for it, Congressman Pence kept pushing for it. We're going to stand up against efforts to privatize Social Security. And we'll look for ways to keep it solvent going forward, focusing primarily on the payroll tax cap. QUIJANO: Governor Pence, I'll give you an opportunity to respond. PENCE: Well, thanks, Elaine. There they go again. OK... KAINE: Go read -- go read the book. PENCE: All Donald Trump -- all Donald Trump and I have said about Social Security is we're going to meet our obligations to our seniors. That's it. KAINE: Go read the book. PENCE: We've said we're going to meet the obligations of Medicare. That's what this campaign is really about, Senator. And I get, this is -- this is the old scare tactic that they roll out... KAINE: But -- but you have a voting record, Governor. PENCE: And I get all of that. I just, look... PENCE: There's a question that you asked a little bit earlier that I want to go back to. KAINE: I can't believe that you won't defend your own voting record. PENCE: I have to go back to. PENCE: Well, look, I -- you're running with Hillary Clinton, who wants to raise taxes by $1 trillion, increase spending by $2 trillion, and you say you're going to keep the promises of Social Security. Donald Trump and I are going to cut taxes. We're going to -- we're going to -- we're going to... KAINE: You're not going to cut taxes. You're going to raise taxes on the middle class. PENCE: ... reform government programs so we can meet the obligations of Social Security and Medicare. QUIJANO: All right. PENCE: Stay on the path that your party has us on, we're going to be in a -- in a mountain range of debt. And we're going to face hard choices and... QUIJANO: Gentleman, I want to move on now. KAINE: You did ask this question about debt, and the debt explosion on the Trump plan is much, much bigger than anything on the Clinton side. QUIJANO: All right. Let me move on now... PENCE: Three hundred and five (ph) economists said your plan is bad for the economy. QUIJANO: ... to the issue of law enforcement and race relations. Law enforcement and race relations. After the Dallas police shooting, Police Chief David Brown said, quote, ""We're asking cops to do too much in this country. Every societal failure we put it off on the cops to solve. Not enough mental health funding, not enough drug addiction funding, schools fail, let's give it to the cops."" Do we ask too much of police officers in this country? And how would you specifically address the chief's concerns? Senator Kaine? KAINE: Elaine, I think that's a very fair comment. I think we put a lot on police shoulders. And this is something I got a lot of scar tissue and experience on. I was a city councilman and mayor in Richmond. And when I came in, we had one of the highest homicide rates in the United States. We fought very, very hard over the course of my time in local office with our police department, and we reduced our homicide rate nearly in half. And then when I was governor of Virginia, we worked hard, too. And we did something we had really wanted to do. For the first time ever, we cracked the top 10, 10 safest states, because we worked together. Here's what I learned as a mayor and a governor. The way you make communities safer and the way you make police safer is through community policing. You build the bonds between the community and the police force, build bonds of understanding, and then when people feel comfortable in their communities, that gap between the police and the communities they serve narrows. And when that gap narrows, it's safer for the communities and it's safer for the police. That model still works across our country, but there are some other models that don't work, an overly aggressive, more militarized model. Donald Trump recently said we need to do more stop-and-frisk around the country. That would be a big mistake because it polarizes the relationship between the police and the community. So here's what we'll do. We'll focus on community policing. We will focus on -- and Hillary Clinton has rolled out a really comprehensive mental health reform package that she worked on with law enforcement professionals, and we will also fight the scourge of gun violence in the United States. I'm a gun-owner. I'm a strong Second Amendment supporter. But I've got a lot of scar tissue, because when I was governor of Virginia, there was a horrible shooting at Virginia Tech, and we learned that through that painful situation that gaps in the background record check system should have been closed and it could have prevented that crime, and so we're going to work to do things like close background record checks. And if we do, we won't have the tragedies that we did. One of those killed at Virginia Tech was a guy named Liviu Librescu. He was a 70-plus-year-old Romanian Holocaust survivor. He had survived the Holocaust. Then he survived the Soviet Union takeover of his country. But then he was a visiting professor at Virginia Tech, and he couldn't survive the scourge of gun violence. We can support the Second Amendment and do things like background record checks and make us safer, and that will make police safer, too. QUIJANO: Governor Pence? PENCE: You know, my uncle was a cop, a career cop, on the beat in downtown Chicago. He was my hero when I was growing up. And we'd go up to visit my dad's family in Chicago. My three brothers and I would marvel at my uncle when he would come out in his uniform, sidearm at his side. Police officers are the best of us. And the men and women, white, African-American, Asian, Latino, Hispanic, they put their lives on the line every single day. And let my say, at the risk of agreeing with you, community policing is a great idea. It's worked in the Hoosier state. And we fully support that. Donald Trump and I are going to make sure that law enforcement have the resources and the tools to be able to really restore law and order to the cities and communities in this nation. It's probably -- probably why the 330,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Donald Trump as the next president of the United States of America, because they see his commitment to them. They see his commitment to law and order. But they also -- they also hear the bad mouthing, the bad mouthing that comes from people that seize upon tragedy in the wake of police action shootings as -- as a reason to -- to use a broad brush to accuse law enforcement of -- of implicit bias or institutional racism. And that really has got to stop. I mean, when an African-American police officer in Charlotte named Brentley Vinson, an all-star football player who went to Liberty University here in the state, came home, followed his dad into law enforcement, joined the force in Charlotte, joined the force in Charlotte in 2014, was involved in a police action shooting that claimed the life of Keith -- Keith Lamont Scott, it was a tragedy. I mean, I -- we -- we mourn with those who mourn. We -- we grieve with those who grieve. And we're saddened at the loss of life. But Hillary Clinton actually referred to that moment as an example of implicit bias in the police force, where -- where she used -- when she was asked in the debate a week ago whether there was implicit bias in law enforcement, her only answer was that there's implicit bias in everyone in the United States. I just think... KAINE: Can I -- can I explain... PENCE: ... I just think what we ought to do is we ought to stop seizing on these moments of tragedy. We ought to assure the public that we'll have a full and complete and transparent investigation whenever there's a loss of life because of police action. But, Senator, please, you know, enough of this seeking every opportunity to demean law enforcement broadly by making the accusation of implicit bias every time tragedy occurs. KAINE: Elaine -- Elaine, people shouldn't be afraid to bring up issues of bias in law enforcement. And if you're afraid to have... PENCE: I'm not afraid to bring that up. KAINE: And if -- if you're afraid to have the discussion, you'll never solve it. And so here's -- here's an example, heartbreaking. We would agree this was a heartbreaking example. The guy, Philando Castile, who was killed in St. Paul, he was a worker, a valued worker in a local school. And he was killed for no apparent reason in an incident that will be discussed and will be investigated. But when folks went and explored this situation, what they found is that Philando Castile, who was a -- they called him Mr. Rogers with Dreadlocks in the school that he worked. The kids loved him. But he had been stopped by police 40 or 50 times before that fatal incident. And if you look at sentencing in this country, African-Americans and Latinos get sentenced for the same crimes at very different rates. PENCE: We need criminal justice reform. PENCE: Indiana has passed criminal justice reform. KAINE: But I just want to say, those who say that we should not... PENCE: But that's not what you're talking about. KAINE: ... we should not be able to bring up and talk about bias in the system, we'll never solve the problem... QUIJANO: Governor Pence... QUIJANO: Governor Pence... PENCE: Senator, when African-American police officers involved in a police action shooting involving an African-American, why would Hillary Clinton accuse that African-American police officer of implicit bias? KAINE: Well, I guess I can't believe you are defending the position that there is no bias and it's a topic we don't even... QUIJANO: Governor Pence, I have a question on that point. PENCE: I did not make that statement. I... QUIJANO: Your fellow Republican, Governor Pence, Senator Tim Scott, who is African-American, recently spoke on the Senate floor. He said he was stopped seven times by law enforcement in one year. KAINE: A U.S. senator. QUIJANO: He said, ""I have felt the anger, the frustration, the sadness, and the humiliation that comes with feeling like you're being targeted for nothing more than being just yourself."" What would you say to Senator Scott about his experiences? PENCE: Well, I have the deepest respect for Senator Scott, and he's a close friend. And what I would say is that we -- we need to adopt criminal justice reform nationally. I -- I signed criminal justice reform in the state of Indiana, Senator, and we're very proud of it. I worked when I was Congress on a second chance act. We have got to do a better job recognizing and correcting the errors in the system that do reflect on institutional bias in criminal justice. But what -- what -- what Donald Trump and I are saying is let's not have the reflex of assuming the worst of men and women in law enforcement. We truly do believe that law enforcement is not a force for racism or division in our country... KAINE: Elaine, can I... QUIJANO: So what would you say to Senator Scott, Governor? PENCE: Law enforcement in this country is a force for good. They are the -- they truly are people that put their lives on the line every single day. But I would -- I would suggest to you, what we need to do is assert a stronger leadership at the national level to support law enforcement. You just heard Senator Kaine reject stop-and-frisk. Well, I would suggest to you that the families that live in our inner cities that are besieged by crime... KAINE: Elaine, let me -- let me... QUIJANO: Governor, the question is about Senator Scott. What would -- what would you tell Senator Scott? KAINE: Elaine, if I could -- if I could jump in. I've heard Senator Scott make that eloquent plea. And look, criminal justice is about respecting the law and being respected by the law. So there is a fundamental respect issue here. And I just want to talk about the tone that's set from the top. Donald Trump during his campaign has called Mexicans rapists and criminals. He's called women slobs, pigs, dogs, disgusting. I don't like saying that in front of my wife and my mother. He attacked an Indiana-born federal judge and said he was unqualified to hear a federal lawsuit because his parents were Mexican. He went after John McCain, a POW, and said he wasn't hero because he'd been captured. He said African-Americans are living in Hell. And he perpetrated this outrageous and bigoted lie that President Obama is not a U.S. citizen. If you want to have a society where people are respected and respect laws, you can't have somebody at the top who demeans every group that he talks about. And I just -- again, I cannot believe that Governor Pence will defend the insult-driven campaign that Donald Trump has run. QUIJANO: All right. I want to turn to our next segment now, immigration. Your running mates have both said that undocumented immigrants who have committed violent crimes should be deported. What would you tell the millions of undocumented immigrants who have not committed violent crimes? Governor Pence? PENCE: Donald Trump's laid out a plan to end illegal immigration once and for all in this country. We've been talking it to death for 20 years. Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to continue the policies of open borders, amnesty, catch and release, sanctuary cities, all the things that are driving -- that are driving wages down in this country, Senator, and also too often with criminal aliens in the country, it's bringing heartbreak. But I -- Donald Trump has a plan that he laid out in Arizona, that will deal systemically with illegal immigration, beginning with border security, internal enforcement. It's probably why for the first time in the history of Immigration and Customs Enforcement their union actually endorsed Donald Trump as the next president of the United States, because they know they need help to enforce the laws of this country. And Donald Trump has laid out a priority to remove criminal aliens, remove people that have overstayed their visas. And -- and once we have accomplished all of that, which will -- which will strengthen our economy, strengthen the rule of law in the country and make our communities safer once the criminal aliens are out, then we'll deal with those that remain. But I have to tell you, I just -- I was listening to the avalanche of insults coming out of Senator Kaine a minute ago. KAINE: These were Donald's -- hold on a second, Governor. PENCE: It's my time, Senator. QUIJANO: It is, in fact, the governor's time. KAINE: I apologize. It's your two minutes. I apologize. PENCE: Thanks. I forgive you. He says ours is an insult-driven campaign. Did you all just hear that? Ours is an insult-driven campaign? I mean, to be honest with you, if Donald Trump had said all of the things that you've said he said in the way you said he said them, he still wouldn't have a fraction of the insults that Hillary Clinton leveled when she said that half of our supporters were a basket of deplorables. It's -- she said they were irredeemable, they were not American. I mean, it's extraordinary. And then she labeled one after another ""ism"" on millions of Americans who believe that we can have a stronger America at home and abroad, who believe we can get this economy moving again, who believe that we can end illegal immigration once and for all. So, Senator, this -- this insult-driven campaign, I mean... PENCE: That's small potatoes compared to Hillary Clinton... QUIJANO: Senator Kaine? PENCE: .... calling half of Donald Trump's supporters a basket of deplorables. KAINE: Hillary Clinton said something on the campaign trail, and the very next day, she said, you know what, I shouldn't have said that. PENCE: She said she shouldn't have said half. QUIJANO: Governor, this is Senator Kaine's two minutes, please. KAINE: Yeah, that's right, so now we're even. KAINE: Look for Donald trump apologizing to John McCain for saying he wasn't a hero... KAINE: ... to Donald Trump apologizing for calling women slobs, pigs, dogs, disgusting. PENCE: She apologized for saying ""half."" QUIJANO: Governor. It is his two minutes, please. KAINE: Did Donald Trump apologize for taking after somebody in a Twitter war and making fun of her weight? Did he apologize for saying African-Americans are living in Hell? Did he apologize for saying President Obama was not even a citizen of the United States? You will look in vain to see Donald Trump ever taking responsibility for anybody and apologizing. Immigration. There's two plans on the table. Hillary and I believe in comprehensive immigration reform. Donald Trump believes in deportation nation. You've got to pick your choice. Hillary and I want a bipartisan reform that will put keeping families together as the top goal, second, that will help focus enforcement efforts on those who are violent, third, that will do more border control, and, fourth, that will provide a path to citizenship for those who work hard, pay taxes, play by the rules, and take criminal background record checks. That's our proposal. Donald Trump proposes to deport 16 million people, 11 million who are here without documents. And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to get rid of birthright citizenship. So if you're born here, but your parents don't have documents, they want to eliminate that. That's another 4.5 million people. These guys -- and Donald Trump have said it -- deportation force. They want to go house to house, school to school, business to business, and kick out 16 million people. And I cannot believe... PENCE: That's nonsense. That's nonsense. KAINE: I cannot believe that Governor Pence would sit here and defend his running mate's claim that we should create a deportation force to -- so that they'll all be gone. PENCE: Senator, we have a deportation force. It's called Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. And the union for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement for the first time in their history endorsed Donald Trump to be the next president of the United States of America. KAINE: So you like the 16 million deportations? PENCE: Senator, that's -- that's nonsense. Look, what you just heard is they have a plan for open borders, amnesty. That's... KAINE: Our plan is like Ronald Reagan's plan from 1986. PENCE: They call it comprehensive immigration reform -- they call it comprehensive immigration reform on Capitol Hill. We all know the routine. It's amnesty. And you heard one of the last things he mentioned was border security. PENCE: That's how Washington always plays it. PENCE: They always say we're going to do this, we're going to do that, we'll eventually get the border... KAINE: ... border security three years ago, and Governor Pence was against it. QUIJANO: Governor, Mr. Trump has said... PENCE: Ronald Reagan said a nation without borders is not a nation. Donald Trump is committed to restoring the borders of this nation and securing our nation, enforcing our laws. QUIJANO: So, Governor, how would these millions of undocumented immigrants leave? Would they be forcibly removed? PENCE: Well, I think Donald Trump laid out a series of priorities that doesn't ends with border security. It begins with border security. And after we secure the border, not only build a wall, but beneath the ground and in the air, we do internal enforcement. But he said the focus has to be on criminal aliens. We just -- we just had a conversation about law enforcement. We just had a conversation about the -- the violence that's besetting our cities. The reality is that there's heartbreak and tragedy that has struck American families because people that came into this country illegally are now involved in criminal enterprise and activity. And we don't have the resources or the will to deport them systemically. Donald Trump has said we're going to move those people out, people who've overstayed their visas. We're going to enforce the law of this country. We're going to strengthen Immigrations and Customs Enforcements with more resources and more personnel to be able to do that. And then Donald Trump has made it clear, once we've done all of those things, that we're going to reform the immigration system that we have... KAINE: I just have to correct Governor Pence.... PENCE: ... where people can come into this country. PENCE: That's the order that you should do it. Border security, removing criminal aliens, upholding with law, and then -- but then, Senator, I'll work you when you go back to the Senate, I promise you, we'll work you to reform the immigration system. KAINE: I look forward to working together in whatever capacities we serve in. But I just want to make it very, very clear that he's trying to fuzz up what Donald Trump has said. When Donald Trump spoke in Phoenix, he looked the audience in the eye and he said, no, we're building a wall, and we're deporting everybody. He said, quote, ""They will all be gone."" ""They will all be gone."" And this is one of these ones where you can just go to the tape on it and see what Donald Trump has said. And to add... PENCE: He's talking about criminal aliens. KAINE: And to add to it, and to add to it, and to add to it, we are a nation of immigrants. Mike Pence and I both are descended from immigrant families. Some things, you know, maybe weren't said so great about the Irish when they came, but we've done well by absorbing immigrants, and it's made our nation stronger. When Donald Trump says Mexicans are rapists and criminals, Mexican immigrants, when Donald Trump says about your judge, a Hoosier judge, he said that Judge Curiel was unqualified to hear a case because his parents were Mexican, I can't imagine how you could defend that. QUIJANO: Gentleman, I'd like to shift now to the threat of terrorism. Do you think the world today is a safer or more dangerous place than it was eight years ago? Has the terrorist threat increased or decreased? Senator Kaine? KAINE: The terrorist threat has decreased in some ways, because bin Laden is dead. The terrorist threat has decreased in some ways because an Iranian nuclear weapons program has been stopped. The terrorist threat to United States troops has been decreased in some ways because there's not 175,000 in a dangerous part of the world. There's only 15,000. But there are other parts of the world that are challenging. Let me tell you this: To beat terrorism, there's only one candidate who can do it, and it's Hillary Clinton. Remember, Hillary Clinton was the senator from New York on 9/11. She was there at the World Trade Center when they were still searching for victims and survivors. That's seared onto her, the need to beat terrorism. And she's got a plan to do it. She was part of the national security team that wiped out bin Laden. Here's her plan to defeat ISIL. First, we've got to keep taking out their leaders on the battlefield. She was part of the team that got bin Laden, and she'll lead the team that will get Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the head of ISIS. Second, we've got to disrupt financing networks, third, disrupt their ability to recruit on the Internet, in their safe havens. But, fourth, we also have to work with allies to share and surge intelligence. That's the Hillary Clinton plan; she's got the experience to do it. Donald Trump. Donald Trump can't start a Twitter war with Miss Universe without shooting himself in the foot. Donald Trump doesn't have a plan. He said, ""I have a secret plan,"" and then he said, ""Um, I know more than all the generals about ISIL."" And then he said, ""I'm going to call the generals to help me figure out a plan."" And finally he said, ""I'm going to fire all the generals."" He doesn't have a plan. But he does have dangerous ideas. Here's four. He trash talks the military. The military is a disaster, John McCain's no hero, the generals need all to be fired, and I know more than them. He wants to tear up alliances. NATO is obsolete, and we'll only work together with Israel if they pay ""big league."" Third, he loves dictators. He's got kind of a personal Mount Rushmore, Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un, Moammar Gadhafi... PENCE: Oh, please. Come on. KAINE: ... and Saddam Hussein. And last and most dangerously, Donald Trump believes -- Donald Trump believes that the world will be safer if more nations have nuclear weapons. He's said Saudi Arabia should get them, Japan should get them, Korea should get them. And when he was confronted with this, and told, wait a minute, terrorists could get those, proliferation could lead to nuclear war, here's what Donald Trump said, and I quote: ""Go ahead, folks, enjoy yourselves."" I'd love to hear Governor Pence tell me what's so enjoyable or comical about nuclear war. QUIJANO: Governor Pence? PENCE: Did you work on that one a long time? Because that had a lot of really creative lines in it. KAINE: Well, I'm going to see if you can defend any of it. PENCE: Well, look, I can defend -- I -- I -- I can -- I can make very clear to the American people, after traveling millions of miles as our secretary of state, after being the architect of the foreign policy of this administration, America is less safe today than it was the day that Barack Obama became president of the United States. It's absolutely inarguable. We've weakened America's place in the world. It's been a combination of factors, but mostly it's been a lack of leadership. I mean, I will give you -- and I was in Washington, D.C., on 9/11. I saw the clouds of smoke rise from the Pentagon. KAINE: I was in Virginia where the Pentagon's... PENCE: I know you were. We all lived through that day as a nation. It was heartbreaking. And I want to give this president credit for bringing Osama bin Laden to justice. But the truth is, Osama bin Laden led Al Qaida. Our primary threat today is ISIS. And because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement that would have allowed some American combat troops to remain in Iraq and secure the hard fought gains the American soldier had won by 2009, ISIS was able to be literally conjured up out of the desert, and it's overrun vast areas that the American soldier had won in Operation Iraqi Freedom. My heart breaks for the likes of Lance Cpl. Scott Zubowski. He fell in Fallujah in 2005. He fought hard through some of the most difficult days in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and he paid the ultimate sacrifice to defend our freedom and secure that nation. And that nation was secured in 2009. But because Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama failed to provide a status of forces agreement and leave sufficient troops in there, we are back at war. The president just ordered more troops on the ground. We are back at war in Iraq. And Scott Zubowski, whose mom would always come to Memorial Day events in Newcastle, Indiana, to see me, and I'd give her a hug and tell her we're never going to forget her son and we never will, Scott Zubowski and the sacrifices the American soldier made were squandered in Iraq because this administration created a vacuum in which ISIS was able to grow. And a reference to the Iranian deal, the Iranian deal that Hillary Clinton initiated, $150 billion to the radical mullahs in Iran. KAINE: Stopping a nuclear weapons program without firing a shot? PENCE: You didn't stop the nuclear weapons program. PENCE: You essentially... KAINE: Even the Israeli military says it stopped. PENCE: ... guaranteed that Iran will someday become a nuclear power, because there's no limitations once the period of time of the treaty comes off. QUIJANO: Governor Pence, Mr. Trump has proposed extreme vetting of immigrants from parts of the world that export terrorism. But that does not address many of the recent terrorist attacks in the United States, such as the Orlando nightclub massacre and the recent bombings in New York and New Jersey. Those were homegrown, committed by U.S. citizens and legal residents. What specific tools would you use to prevent those kinds of attacks? PENCE: Well, I think it's -- I think it's a great question, Elaine, but it really does begin with us reforming our immigration system and putting the interests, particularly the safety and security of the American people, first. I mean, Donald Trump has called for extreme vetting for people coming into this country so that we don't bring people into the United States who are hostile to our Bill of Rights freedoms, who are hostile to the American way life. But also, Donald Trump and I are committed to suspending the Syrian refugee program and programs and immigration from areas of the world that have been compromised by terrorism. Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to increase the Syrian refugee program by 500... KAINE: Elaine, I want to... QUIJANO: Governor, the question was about homegrown. PENCE: Yeah, and so -- but first, you know, let's make sure we're putting the safety and security of the American people first instead of Hillary Clinton expanding the Syrian refugee program... KAINE: Or instead of you violating the Constitution by blocking people based on their national origin rather than whether they're dangerous. PENCE: That's not -- that's absolutely false. KAINE: That's what the Seventh Circuit decided just -- here's the difference, Elaine. PENCE: The Seventh Circuit... KAINE: We have different views on -- on refugee issues and on immigration. Hillary and I want to do enforcement based on, are people dangerous? These guys say all Mexicans are bad. PENCE: That's absolutely false. KAINE: And with respect to refugees, we want to keep people out if they're dangerous. Donald Trump said keep them out if they're Muslim. Mike Pence... KAINE: ... put a program in place to keep them out if they're from Syria. And yesterday an appellate court with three Republican judges struck down the Pence plan... KAINE: ... and said it was discriminatory... PENCE: And those judges -- those judges said... KAINE: We should focus upon danger, not upon discrimination. PENCE: Elaine, to your point, those judges said it was because there wasn't any evidence yet that -- that ISIS had infiltrated the United States. Well, Germany just arrested three Syrian refugees that were connected to ISIS. KAINE: But they told you there's a right way and a wrong way to do it. PENCE: But, look, if you're going to be critical of me on that, that's fair game. I will tell you, after two Syrian refugees were involved in the attack in Paris that is called Paris' 9/11, as governor of the state of Indiana, I have no higher priority than the safety and security of the people of my state. KAINE: But, Governor Pence... PENCE: So you bet I suspended that program. KAINE: But, Governor Pence, I just... PENCE: And I stand by that decision. And if I'm vice president of the United States or Donald Trump is president, we're going to put the safety and security of the American people first. KAINE: Sure. Can we just be clear -- Hillary and I will do immigration enforcement and we'll vet refugees based on whether they're dangerous or not. We won't do it based on discriminating against you from the country you come from or the religion that you practice. PENCE: But the problem with that... KAINE: That is completely antithetical to the Jeffersonian values of... PENCE: Elaine, the director of the FBI, our homeland security, said we can't know for certain who these people are coming from Syria. KAINE: Yes, we can, and when we don't let them know, we don't let them in. PENCE: So -- the FBI... KAINE: When we don't know who they are, we don't let them in. PENCE: The FBI and homeland security said we can't know for certain. You've got to err on the side of the safety and security of the American people, Senator. I understand the... KAINE: By trashing all Syrians or trashing all Muslims? PENCE: ... the U.N. wants us to expand the Syrian refugee program... QUIJANO: Senator Kaine, let me ask you this. Secretary Clinton... PENCE: We're going to put the safety and security of the American people first. QUIJANO: ... has talked about an intelligence surge. QUIJANO: What exactly would an intelligence surge look like? And how would that help identify terrorists with no operational connection to a foreign terrorist organization? KAINE: Intelligence surge is two-thirds, Elaine. It's two things. It's, first, dramatically expanding our intelligence capacities by hiring great professionals, but also we've got some of the best intel and cyber employees in the world right here in the United States working for many of our private sector companies. So it involves increasing our own workforce, but striking great partnerships with some of our cyber and intel experts in the private sector so that we can, consistent with constitutional principles, gather more intelligence. But the second piece of this is really, really important. It also means creating stronger alliances, because you gather intelligence and then you share your intelligence back and forth with allies. And that's how you find out who may be trying to recruit, who may be trying to come to one country or the next. Alliances are critical. That's why Donald Trump's claim that he wants to -- that NATO is obsolete and that we need to get rid of NATO is so dangerous. PENCE: That's not his plan. KAINE: Well, he said NATO is obsolete. And, look, if you put aside -- push aside your alliances, who you're going to share intelligence with? Hillary Clinton is the secretary of state who knows how to build alliances. She built the sanctions regime around the word that stopped the Iranian nuclear weapons program. And that's what an intelligence surge means. Better skill and capacity, but also better alliances. QUIJANO: All right. I'd like to turn now to the tragedy in Syria. Two hundred fifty thousand... PENCE: Can I speak about the cybersecurity surge at all? QUIJANO: You can -- you can have 30 seconds, Governor, quickly, please. PENCE: First, Donald Trump just spoke about this issue this week. We have got to bring together the best resources of this country to understand that cyber warfare is the new warfare of the asymmetrical enemies that we face in this country. And I look forward if I'm privileged to be in this role of working with you in the Senate to make sure that we resource that effort. KAINE: We will work together in whatever roles we inhabit. PENCE: We have an intelligence, sir (ph). But I will also tell you that it's important in this moment to remember that Hillary Clinton had a private server in her home that had classified information on it... QUIJANO: And I don't -- 30 seconds is on up. PENCE: ... about drone strikes, e-mails from the president of the United States of America were on there. PENCE: Her private server was subject to being hacked by foreign... QUIJANO: I'd like to ask you about Syria, Governor. PENCE: We could put cybersecurity first if we just make sure the next secretary of state doesn't have a private server. KAINE: And all investigation concluded that not one reasonable prosecutor would take any additional step. You don't get to decide the rights and wrongs of this. We have a justice system that does that. And a Republican FBI director did an investigation and concluded that... (CROSSTALK) QUIJANO: All right, we are moving on now. Two hundred fifty thousand people... PENCE: If your son or my son handled classified information the way Hillary Clinton did... QUIJANO: ... one hundred thousand of them children -- Governor... PENCE: ... they'd be court martialed. KAINE: That is absolutely false and you know that. PENCE: Absolutely true. KAINE: And you know that, Governor. PENCE: It's absolutely true. QUIJANO: Gentlemen, please. KAINE: Because the FBI did an investigation. KAINE: And they concluded that there was no reasonable prosecutor who would take it further. Sorry. QUIJANO: Senator Kaine, Governor Pence, please. QUIJANO: I want to turn now to Syria. Two hundred fifty thousand people, 100,000 of them children, are under siege in Aleppo, Syria. Bunker buster bombs, cluster munitions, and incendiary weapons are being dropped on them by Russian and Syrian militaries. Does the U.S. have a responsibility to protect civilians and prevent mass casualties on this scale, Governor Pence? PENCE: The United States of America needs to begin to exercise strong leadership to protect the vulnerable citizens and over 100,000 children in Aleppo. Hillary Clinton's top priority when she became secretary of state was the Russian reset, the Russians reset. After the Russian reset, the Russians invaded Ukraine and took over Crimea. And the small and bullying leader of Russia is now dictating terms to the United States to the point where all the United States of America -- the greatest nation on Earth -- just withdraws from talks about a cease-fire while Vladimir Putin puts a missile defense system in Syria while he marshals the forces and begins -- look, we have got to begin to lean into this with strong, broad-shouldered American leadership. It begins by rebuilding our military. And the Russians and the Chinese have been making enormous investments in the military. We have the smallest Navy since 1916. We have the lowest number of troops since the end of the Second World War. We've got to work with Congress, and Donald Trump will, to rebuild our military and project American strength in the world. But about Aleppo and about Syria, I truly do believe that what America ought to do right now is immediately establish safe zones, so that families and vulnerable families with children can move out of those areas, work with our Arab partners, real time, right now, to make that happen. And secondly, I just have to tell you that the provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength. And if Russia chooses to be involved and continue, I should say, to be involved in this barbaric attack on civilians in Aleppo, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike military targets of the Assad regime to prevent them from this humanitarian crisis that is taking place in Aleppo. There's a broad range of other things that we ought to do, as well. We ought to deploy a missile defense shield to the Czech Republic and Poland which Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama pulled back on out of not wanting to offend the Russians back in 2009. QUIJANO: Governor, your two minutes are up. PENCE: We've just got to have American strength on the world stage. When Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, the Russians and other countries in the world will know they're dealing with a strong American president. QUIJANO: Senator Kaine? KAINE: Hillary and I also agree that the establishment of humanitarian zones in northern Syria with the provision of international human aid, consistent with the U.N. Security Council resolution that was passed in February 2014, would be a very, very good idea. And Hillary also has the ability to stand up to Russia in a way that this ticket does not. Donald Trump, again and again, has praised Vladimir Putin. And it's clear that he has business dealings with Russian oligarchs who are very connected to Putin. The Trump campaign management team had to be fired a month or so ago because of those shadowy connections with pro-Putin forces. Governor Pence made the odd claim, he said inarguably Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama. Vladimir Putin has run his economy into the ground. He persecutes LGBT folks and journalists. If you don't know the difference between dictatorship and leadership, then you got to go back to a fifth-grade civics class. I'll tell you what offends me... PENCE: Well, that offended me. KAINE: Governor Pence just said -- Governor Pence just said that Donald Trump will rebuild the military. No, he won't. Donald Trump is avoiding paying taxes. The New York Times story -- and we need to get this -- but the New York Times suggested that he probably didn't pay taxes for about 18 years starting in 1995. Those years included the years of 9/11. So get this. On 9/11, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's hometown was attacked by the worst terrorist attack in the history of the United States. Young men and women -- young men and women signed up to serve in the military to fight terrorism. Hillary Clinton went to Washington to get funds to rebuild her city and protect first responders, but Donald Trump was fighting a very different fight. It was a fight to avoid paying taxes so that he wouldn't support the fight against terror. QUIJANO: The question was about Aleppo, Senator. KAINE: He wouldn't support troops. He wouldn't -- he wouldn't support -- this is important, Elaine. When a guy running for president will not support the troops, not support veterans, not support teachers, that's really important. KAINE: And I said about Aleppo, we do agree the notion is we have to create a humanitarian zone in northern Syria. It's very important. QUIJANO: Governor Pence, you had mentioned no-fly zone. Where would you propose setting up a safe zone specifically? How would you keep it safe? PENCE: Well, first and foremost, Donald Trump supports our troops. Donald Trump supports our veterans. KAINE: He won't pay taxes. PENCE: Donald Trump has paid all the taxes that he's -- do you not take deductions? How does that work? QUIJANO: Gentlemen, this is about Syria. I'd like to... PENCE: Honestly, Senator. Honestly, Senator. KAINE: It is about our troops. It is about our troops. PENCE: I understand why you want to change -- I understand why you want to change the subject. KAINE: How can you support the troops if you won't pay taxes? PENCE: I understand why you want to change the subject. And let me be very clear on this Russian thing. The larger question here... KAINE: Do you think Donald Trump is smart to not pay taxes? QUIJANO: Gentlemen, we're going to have time to get to Russia here. PENCE: What we're dealing with is the -- you know, there's an old proverb that says the Russian bear never dies, it just hibernates. And the truth of the matter is, the weak and feckless foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama has awakened an aggression in Russia that first appeared a few years ago with their move in Georgia, now their move into Crimea, now their move into the wider Middle East. And all the while, all we do is fold our arms and say we're not having talks anymore. To answer your question, we just need American strength. We need to -- we need to marshal the resources of our allies in the region, and in the immediate, we need to act and act now to get people out of harm's way. QUIJANO: And exactly how would those safe zones work? How would they remain safe? PENCE: The -- the safe zones would have to be -- as the senator said, there's already a framework for this that's been recognized by the international community. The United States of America needs to be prepared to work with our allies in the region to create a route for safe passage and then to protect people in those areas, including with a no-fly zone. But, look, this is very tough stuff. I served on the Foreign Affairs Committee for a decade. I traveled in and out of that region for 10 years. I saw what the American soldier won in Operation Iraqi Freedom. And to see the weak and feckless leadership that Hillary Clinton was the architect of and the foreign policy of the Obama administration... KAINE: Well, let me -- let me come back... PENCE: ... is deeply troubling to me. That will all change the day Donald Trump becomes president of the United States. KAINE: ... and talk about -- let me talk about the things that Governor Pence doesn't want to acknowledge, Elaine. He doesn't want to acknowledge that we stopped the Iranian nuclear weapons program. He doesn't want to acknowledge... KAINE: ... that Hillary was part of a team that got bin Laden. He doesn't want to acknowledge... PENCE: I just did. KAINE: ... that it's a good thing, not a bad thing, that it's a good thing -- not a bad thing -- that we're down from 175,000 troops deployed overseas to 15,000. But let me tell you what will really make the Middle East dangerous. Donald Trump's idea that more nations should get nuclear weapons, Saudi Arabia, Japan, South Korea. Ronald Reagan said something really interesting about nuclear proliferation back in the 1980s. He said the problem with nuclear proliferation is that some fool or maniac could trigger a catastrophic event. And I think that's who Governor Pence's running mate is, exactly who Governor Reagan warned us about. PENCE: And come on. Senator. Senator, that was even beneath you and Hillary Clinton. And that -- that's pretty low. KAINE: But do you -- do you think -- do you think we should have -- more nuclear weapons in the world will make us safer? PENCE: Senator, the... KAINE: That's what Donald Trump thinks. PENCE: Ronald Reagan also said nuclear war should never be fought because it can never be won. And the United States of America needs to make investments in modernizing our nuclear force for both deterrence... KAINE: But can you defend Donald Trump's claim that more nations should get nuclear weapons? PENCE: ... and assurance to our allies. But let me go back to this Iran thing. I mean, he keeps saying that they prevented -- that Hillary Clinton started the deal with the Iranians prevented Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. KAINE: That's what the Israeli joint chiefs of staff is saying right now. PENCE: Well, that's not what -- that's not what Israel thinks. KAINE: Gadi Eizenkot, you can go check it. PENCE: You wouldn't necessarily know that. KAINE: Go to the tape. PENCE: I know you boycotted Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech when he came before the Congress. KAINE: No, I visited him in his office. I visited him in his office. PENCE: You boycotted the speech. The point is, what this Iran -- so-called Iran deal did was essentially guarantee -- I mean, when I was in Congress, I fought hard on a bipartisan basis with Republican and Democrat members to move forward the toughest sanctions, it -- literally in the history of the United States, against Iran. KAINE: And then Hillary used them to get a deal. PENCE: We were bringing them to heel, but the goal was always that we would only lift the sanctions if Iran permanently renounced their nuclear ambitions. KAINE: Elaine, let me just mention one thing. PENCE: They have not -- Elaine, let me finish a sentence. They have not renounced their nuclear ambitions. And when the deal's period runs out, there's no limitation on them obtaining weapons. That... QUIJANO: And very quickly, Senator. PENCE: ... and the fact that they got $1.7 billion in a ransom payment... QUIJANO: We need to talk about Russia. Very quickly, though, Senator, please. PENCE: ... is astonishing to the American people. KAINE: Six times tonight, I have said to Governor Pence I can't imagine how you can defend your running mate's position on one issue after the next. And in all six cases, he's refused to defend his running mate. PENCE: Well, let's -- no, no, don't put words in my mouth. KAINE: And yet he is asking everybody to vote for somebody that he cannot defend. And I just think that should be underlined. PENCE: No, I'm -- look... QUIJANO: All right, gentlemen, let's talk about Russia. This is a topic that has come up. PENCE: I'm very, very happy to defend Donald Trump. If he wants to take these one at a time, I'll take them one at a time. QUIJANO: I will give you an opportunity to do that. KAINE: More nations should get nuclear weapons. Try to defend that. PENCE: Don't put words in my mouth. Well, he never said that, Senator. KAINE: He absolutely said it. Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Japan. PENCE: Most of the stuffy you've said, he's never said. QUIJANO: Gentlemen, Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, annexed Crimea, and has provided crucial military support to the Assad regime. What steps, if any, would your administration take to counter these actions? Senator Kaine? KAINE: You've got to be tough on Russia. So let's start with not praising Vladimir Putin as a great leader. Donald Trump and Mike Pence have said he's a great leader. And Donald Trump has business... PENCE: No, we haven't. KAINE: ... has business dealings -- has business dealings with Russia that he refuses to disclose. Hillary Clinton has gone toe-to- toe with Russia. She went toe-to-toe with Russia as secretary of state to do the New START Agreement to reduce Russia's nuclear stockpile. She's had the experience doing it. She went toe-to-toe with Russia and lodged protests when they went into Georgia. And we've done the same thing about Ukraine, but more than launching protests, we've put punishing economic sanctions on Russia that we need to continue. Donald Trump, on the other hand, didn't know that Russia had invaded the Crimea. PENCE: Oh, that's nonsense. KAINE: He was on a TV show a couple months back, and he said, ""I'll guarantee you this, Russia's not going into the Ukraine."" And he had to be reminded that they had gone into the Crimea two years before. KAINE: Hillary Clinton has gone toe-to-toe with Russia to work out a deal on New START. She got them engaged on a meaningful way to cap Iran's nuclear weapons program. And yet she stood up to them on issues such as Syria and their invasion of Georgia. You've got to have the ability to do that, and Hillary does. On the other hand, in Donald Trump, you have somebody who praises Vladimir Putin all the time. America should really wonder about a President Trump, who had a campaign manager with ties to Putin, pro- Putin elements in the Ukraine, who had to be fired for that reason. They should wonder -- when Donald Trump is sitting down with Vladimir Putin, is it going to be America's bottom line or is it going to be Donald Trump's bottom line that he's going to be worried about with all of his business dealings? Now, this could be solved if Donald Trump would be willing to release his tax returns, as he told the American public that he would do. And I know he's laughing at this, but every president... PENCE: But what's it got to do with Russia? KAINE: Every president since Richard Nixon has done it, and Donald Trump has said I'm doing business with Russia. The only way the American public will see whether he has a conflict of interest... PENCE: No, he hasn't said that. KAINE: He has, actually. QUIJANO: Senator, your time is up. Governor? PENCE: Well, thanks. I'm just trying to keep up with the insult-driven campaign on the other side of the table. KAINE: You know, I'm just saying facts about your running mate. KAINE: And I know you can't defend. QUIJANO: Senator, please. This is the governor's two minutes. PENCE: I'm happy to defend him, Senator. Don't put words in my mouth that I'm not defending him. PENCE: I'm happy to defend him. Most of what you said is completely false, and the American people know that. KAINE: I'll run through the list of things where you won't defend... PENCE: This isn't the old days where you can just say stuff and people believe it. QUIJANO: Senator, please. This is Governor Pence's two minutes. PENCE: Look, this is the alternative universe of Washington, D.C., versus reality. Hillary Clinton said her number-one priority was a reset with Russia. That reset resulted in the invasion of Ukraine, after they'd infiltrated with what are called little green men, Russian soldiers that were dressing up like Ukrainian dissidents, and then they moved all the way into Crimea, took over the Crimean Peninsula. Donald Trump knew that happened. He basically was saying it's not going to happen again. The truth of the matter is that what you have in the rise of aggressive Russia, which has had -- increased its influence in Iran, that's now -- now because of this deal is on a pathway in the future to obtain a nuclear -- the leading state sponsor of terror in the world in Iran now has a closer working relationship with Russia because of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama's foreign policy and $150 billion and sanctions all being lifted. And then, of course, Syria, I mean, it really is extraordinary that -- Syria is imploding. You just asked a very thoughtful question about the disaster in Aleppo. ISIS is headquartered in Raqqa. It is -- ISIS from Raqqa has overrun vast areas that at great sacrifice the American soldier won in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and yet Senator Kaine still sits here, loyal soldier -- I get all that -- in saying that the foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama somehow made the world more secure. I mean, it really is astonishing that on the day... KAINE: We even wiped out the leader of Al Qaida. PENCE: ... on the day that Iran released four American hostages... KAINE: We stopped Iran from getting nuclear weapons. PENCE: ... we delivered $400 million in cash as a ransom payment for Americans held by the radical mullahs in Tehran. QUIJANO: Governor, yesterday, Mr. Trump said... KAINE: And we stopped a nuclear weapons program without a shot. QUIJANO: ... quote, ""Putin has no respect for Hillary Clinton and no respect for Obama."" Why do you think he'll respect a Trump- Pence administration? PENCE: Strength. Plain and simple. KAINE: Business dealings. PENCE: Donald Trump -- that's nonsense. Donald Trump is a strong leader... KAINE: Donald Trump's son says that the Trump organization... PENCE: ... who is going to lead with American strength. QUIJANO: Please, Senator, I'll give you a chance to respond. PENCE: We're going to rebuild our military. And let me -- let me -- this whole Putin thing. Look, America is stronger than Russia. Our economy is 16 times larger than the Russian economy. America's political system is superior to the crony, corrupt capitalist system in Russia in every way. When Donald Trump and I observe that, as I've said in Syria, in Iran, in Ukraine, that the small and bullying leader of Russia has been stronger on the world stage than this administration, that's stating painful facts. That's not an endorsement of Vladimir Putin. That's an indictment of the weak and feckless leadership... QUIJANO: Senator Kaine? PENCE: ... of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. KAINE: Well, this is one where we can just kind of go to the tape on it. But Governor Pence said, inarguably, Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama. PENCE: That is absolutely inaccurate. KAINE: And -- and -- and I just think a guy who praises... PENCE: He said he's stronger -- he's been stronger on the world stage. KAINE: No, he said leader. And if -- and I'll just say this, Governor. PENCE: You just said better. KAINE: If you mistake leadership for dictatorship, and you can't tell the difference, a country that's running its economy into the ground... PENCE: Yeah, here we go. This is the grade school thing again? KAINE: ... persecuting journalists... PENCE: Right, this is grade school. KAINE: ... if you can't tell the difference, you shouldn't be commander-in-chief. PENCE: Yeah. KAINE: And with Donald Trump -- Donald Trump's sons say that they have all these business dealings with Russia. Those could be disclosed with tax returns, but they refuse to do them. Americans need to worry about whether Donald Trump will be watching out for America's bottom line or his own bottom line. QUIJANO: Senator Kaine, what went wrong with the Russia reset? KAINE: Vladimir Putin. Vladimir Putin is a dictator. QUIJANO: And what would do you differently? KAINE: Vladimir Putin is a dictator. He's not a leader. Anybody who thinks otherwise doesn't know Russian history and they don't know Vladimir Putin. Hillary Clinton knows exactly who this guy is. John McCain said, I look in his eyes and I see KGB. And Hillary kind of has that same feeling. KAINE: So how do deal with him? You've got to -- we do have to deal with Russia in a lot of different ways. There are areas where we can cooperate. So it was Hillary Clinton who worked with Russia on the New START Treaty to reduce their nuclear weapons stockpile. It was Hillary Clinton that worked with Russia to get them engaged in a community of nations to stop the Iranian nuclear weapons without firing a shot. She's not going around praising Vladimir Putin as a great guy. But she knows how to sit down at a table and negotiate tough deals. This is a very challenging part of the world, and we ought to have a commander-in-chief who is prepared and done it, rather than somebody who goes around praising Vladimir Putin as a great leader. QUIJANO: All right, I'd like to ask now about North Korea, Iran and the threat of nuclear weapons. North Korea recently conducted its fifth and most powerful nuclear test. QUIJANO: What specific steps would you take to prevent North Korea from developing a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States? Governor Pence? PENCE: Well, first, we need to -- we need to make a commitment to rebuild our military, including modernizing our nuclear forces. And we also need -- we also need an effective American diplomacy that will marshal the resources of nations in the Asian Pacific Rim to put pressure on North Korea, on Kim Jong-un, to abandon his nuclear ambitions. It has to remain the policy of the United States of America the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, plain and simple. And when Donald Trump is president of the United States, we're -- we're not going to have the -- the kind of posture in the world that has Russia invading Crimea and Ukraine, that has the Chinese building new islands in the South China Sea, that has literally the world, including North Korea, flouting American power. We're going to -- we're going to go back to the days of peace through strength. But I have to tell you that -- that all this talk about tax returns -- and I get it, you know, you want to keep bringing that up. It must have -- must have... PENCE: ... done well in some focus group. But here -- Hillary Clinton and her husband set up a private foundation called the Clinton Foundation. While she was secretary of state, the Clinton Foundation accepted tens of millions of dollars from foreign governments and foreign donors. Now, you all need to know out there, this is basic stuff. Foreign donors, and certainly foreign governments, cannot participate in the American political process. They cannot make financial contributions. But the Clintons figured out a way to create a foundation where foreign governments and foreign donors could donate millions of dollars. And then we found, thanks to the good work of the Associated Press, that more than half her private meetings when she was secretary of state were given to major donors of the Clinton Foundation. When you talk about all these -- all these baseless rumors about Russia and the rest, Hillary Clinton -- you asked the trustworthy question at the very beginning -- the reason... QUIJANO: Governor, your two minutes are up. PENCE: ... the reason the American people don't trust Hillary Clinton is because they are looking at the pay to play politics that she operated with the Clinton Foundation through a private server... QUIJANO: Governor, please. PENCE: ... while she's secretary of state. QUIJANO: Your two minutes are up, Governor. PENCE: And they're saying enough is enough. QUIJANO: Senator Kaine? KAINE: I'm going to talk about the foundation, and then I'll talk about North Korea. So, on the foundation. I am glad to talk about the foundation. The Clinton Foundation is one of the highest- rated charities in the world. It provides AIDS drugs to about 11.5 million people. It helps Americans deal with opioid overdoses. It gets higher rankings for its charity than the American Red Cross does. The Clinton foundation does an awful lot of good work. Hillary Clinton as secretary of state took no action to benefit the foundation. The State Department did an investigation, and they concluded that everything Hillary Clinton did as secretary of state was completely in the interest of the United States. So the foundation does good work. And Hillary Clinton as secretary of state acted in the interests of the United States. But let's compare this now with the Trump organization and the Trump Foundation. The Trump organization is an octopus-like organization with tentacles all over the world whose conflict of interests could only be known if Donald Trump would release his tax returns. He's refused to do it. His sons have said that the organization has a lot of business dealings in Russia. And remember, the Trump organization is not a non-profit. It's putting money into Donald Trump's pockets and into the pockets of his children, whereas the Clinton Foundation is a non- profit and no Clinton family member draws any salary. PENCE: The Trump Foundation is non-profit. KAINE: In addition, Donald Trump has a foundation. The foundation was just fined for illegally contributing foundation dollars to a political campaign of a Florida attorney general. They made an illegal contribution, and then they tried to hide it by disguising it to somebody else. And the person they donated to was somebody whose office was charged with investigating Trump University. This is the difference between a foundation that does good work and a secretary of state who acted in accordance with American interest and somebody who is conflicted and doing work around the world and won't share with the American public what he's doing and what those conflicts are. QUIJANO: Governor, I will give you 30 seconds to respond, because I know you want to, but, again, I would remind you both this was about North Korea. PENCE: Well, Thank you. Thank you. The Trump Foundation is a private family foundation. They give virtually every cent in the Trump Foundation to charitable causes. KAINE: Political contributions? PENCE: Less than ten cents on the dollar in the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes. KAINE: A $20,000 portrait of Donald Trump? PENCE: Less than 10 cents on the dollar of the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes. KAINE: Ninety percent. PENCE: It has been a platform for the Clintons to travel the world, to have staff. But honestly, Senator, we would know a lot more about it if Hillary Clinton would just turn over the 33,000 e-mails... QUIJANO: All right, let's turn back to North Korea... PENCE: ... that she refused to turn over in her private server... QUIJANO: Senator Kaine... PENCE: ... and we'd have a much better picture of what the Clinton Foundation was about. QUIJANO: Senator Kaine, if you had intelligence that North Korea was about to launch a missile, a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States, would you take preemptive action? KAINE: If we -- look, a president should take action to defend the United States against imminent threat. You have to. A president has to do that. Now exactly what action, you would have to determine what your intelligence was, how certain you were of that intelligence, but you would have to take action. You asked the question about how do we deal with a North Korea. I'm on the Foreign Relations Committee. We just did an extensive sanctions package against North Korea. And interestingly enough, Elaine, the U.N. followed and did this -- virtually the same package. Often China will use their veto in the Security Council to veto a package like that. They're starting to get worried about North Korea, too. So they actually supported the sanctions package, even though many of the sanctions are against Chinese firms, Chinese financial institutions. So we're working together with China, and we need to. China's another one of those relationships where it's competitive, it's also challenging, and in times like North Korea, we have to be able to cooperate. Hillary understands that very well. She went once famously to China and stood up at a human rights meeting and looked them in the eye and said, ""Women's rights are human rights."" They didn't want her to say that, but she did. But she's also worked on a lot of diplomatic and important diplomatic deals with China. And that's what it's going to take. The thing I would worry a little bit about is that Donald Trump owes about $650 million to banks, including the Bank of China. I'm not sure he could stand up so tough to the people who have loaned him money. QUIJANO: All right. I'd like to turn to our next segment now. And in this, I'd like to focus on social issues. You have both been open about the role that faith has played in your lives. Can you discuss in detail a time when you struggled to balance your personal faith and a public policy position? Senator Kaine? KAINE: Yeah, that's an easy one for me, Elaine. It's an easy one. I'm really fortunate. I grew up in a wonderful household with great Irish Catholic parents. My mom and dad are sitting right here. I was educated by Jesuits at Rockhurst High School in Kansas City. My 40th reunion is in 10 days. And I worked with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras, now nearly 35 years ago, and they were the heroes of my life. I try to practice my religion in a very devout way and follow the teachings of my church in my own personal life. But I don't believe in this nation, a First Amendment nation, where we don't raise any religion over the other, and we allow people to worship as they please, that the doctrines of any one religion should be mandated for everyone. For me, the hardest struggle in my faith life was the Catholic Church is against the death penalty and so am I. But I was governor of a state, and the state law said that there was a death penalty for crimes if the jury determined them to be heinous. And so I had to grapple with that. When I was running for governor, I was attacked pretty strongly because of my position on the death penalty. But I looked the voters of Virginia in the eye and said, look, this is my religion. I'm not going to change my religious practice to get one vote, but I know how to take an oath and uphold the law. And if you elect me, I will uphold the law. And I was elected, and I did. It was very, very difficult to allow executions to go forward, but in circumstances where I didn't feel like there was a case for clemency, I told Virginia voters I would uphold the law, and I did. That was a real struggle. But I think it is really, really important that those of us who have deep faith lives don't feel that we could just substitute our own views for everybody else in society, regardless of their views. QUIJANO: Governor Pence? PENCE: Well, it's a wonderful question. And my Christian faith is at the very heart of who I am. I was also raised in a wonderful family of faith. It was a church on Sunday morning and grace before dinner. PENCE: But my Christian faith became real for me when I made a personal decision for Christ when I was a freshman in college. And I've tried to live that out however imperfectly every day of my life since. And with my wife at my side, we've followed a calling into public service, where we've -- we've tried to -- we've tried to keep faith with the values that we cherish. And with regard to when I struggle, I appreciate, and -- and -- and -- I have a great deal of respect for Senator Kaine's sincere faith. I truly do. KAINE: That's shared. PENCE: But for me, I would tell you that for me the sanctity of life proceeds out of the belief that -- that ancient principle that -- where God says before you were formed in the womb, I knew you, and so for my first time in public life, I sought to stand with great compassion for the sanctity of life. The state of Indiana has also sought to make sure that we expand alternatives in health care counseling for women, non-abortion alternatives. I'm also very pleased at the fact we're well on our way in Indiana to becoming the most pro-adoption state in America. I think if you're going to be pro-life, you should -- you should be pro- adoption. But what I can't understand is with Hillary Clinton and now Senator Kaine at her side is to support a practice like partial-birth abortion. I mean, to hold to the view -- and I know Senator Kaine, you hold pro-life views personally -- but the very idea that a child that is almost born into the world could still have their life taken from them is just anathema to me. And I cannot -- I can't conscience about -- about a party that supports that. Or that -- I know you've historically opposed taxpayer funding of abortion. But Hillary Clinton wants to -- wants to repeal the longstanding provision in the law where we said we wouldn't use taxpayer dollars to fund abortion. So for me, my faith informs my life. I try and spend a little time on my knees every day. But it all for me begins with cherishing the dignity, the worth, the value of every human life. KAINE: Elaine, this is a fundamental question, a fundamental question. Hillary and I are both people out of religious backgrounds, from Methodist church experience, which was really formative for her as a public servant. But we really feel like you should live fully and with enthusiasm the commands of your faith. But it is not the role of the public servant to mandate that for everybody else. So let's talk about abortion and choice. Let's talk about them. We support Roe v. Wade. We support the constitutional right of American women to consult their own conscience, their own supportive partner, their own minister, but then make their own decision about pregnancy. That's something we trust American women to do that. And we don't think that women should be punished, as Donald Trump said they should, for making the decision to have an abortion. Governor Pence wants to repeal Roe v. Wade. He said he wants to put it on the ash heap of history. And we have some young people in the audience who weren't even born when Roe was decided. This is pretty important. Before Roe v. Wade, states could pass criminal laws to do just that, to punish women if they made the choice to terminate a pregnancy. I think you should live your moral values. But the last thing, the very last thing that government should do is have laws that would punish women who make reproductive choices. And that is the fundamental difference between a Clinton-Kaine ticket and a Trump- Pence ticket that wants to punish women who make that choice. PENCE: No, it's really not. Donald Trump and I would never support legislation that punished women who made the heartbreaking choice to end a pregnancy. KAINE: Then why did Donald Trump say that? PENCE: We just never would. KAINE: Why did he say that? PENCE: Well, look, it's -- look, he's not a polished politician like you and Hillary Clinton. And so... KAINE: Well, I would admit that's not a polished... PENCE: You know, things don't always come out exactly the way he means them. KAINE: Well, can I say... PENCE: But I'm telling you what the policy of our administration would be. KAINE: Great line from the -- great line from the gospel of Matthew. From the fullness of the heart, the mouth speaks. PENCE: Yeah. KAINE: When Donald Trump says women should be punished or Mexicans are rapists and criminals... PENCE: I'm telling you... KAINE: ... or John McCain is not a hero, he is showing you who he is. PENCE: Senator, you've whipped out that Mexican thing again. He -- look... KAINE: Can you defend it? PENCE: There are criminal aliens in this country, Tim, who have come into this country illegally who are perpetrating violence and taking American lives. KAINE: You want to -- you want to use a big broad brush against Mexicans on that? PENCE: He also said and many of them are good people. You keep leaving that out of your quote. And if you want me to go there, I'll go there. But here's -- there is a choice, and it is a choice on life. I couldn't be more proud to be standing with Donald Trump, who's standing for the right to life. It's a principle that -- Senator Kaine -- and I'm very gentle about this, because I really do respect you -- it's a principle that you embrace. And I have appreciated the fact that you've supported the Hyde amendment, which bans the use of taxpayer funding for abortion, in the past, but that's not Hillary Clinton's view. People need to understand, we can come together as a nation. We can create a culture of life. More and more young people today are embracing life because we know we are -- we're better for it. We can -- like Mother Teresa said at that famous national prayer breakfast... PENCE: ... bring the -- let's welcome the children into our world. There are so many families around the country who can't have children. We could improve adoption... KAINE: But, Governor... PENCE: ... so that families that can't have children can adopt more readily those children from crisis pregnancies. KAINE: Governor, why don't you trust women to make this choice for themselves? We can encourage people to support life. Of course we can. But why don't you trust women? Why doesn't Donald Trump trust women to make this choice for themselves? That's what we ought to be doing in public life. Living our lives of faith or motivation with enthusiasm and excitement, convincing other, dialoguing with each other about important moral issues of the day... PENCE: Because there are... KAINE: ... but on fundamental issues of morality, we should let women make their own decisions. PENCE: Because there is -- a society can be judged by how it deals with its most vulnerable, the aged, the infirm, the disabled, and the unborn. I believe it with all my heart. And I couldn't be more proud to be standing with a pro-life candidate in Donald Trump. QUIJANO: I do have one final question for you both tonight. It has been a divisive campaign. Senator Kaine, if your ticket wins, what specifically are you going to do to unify the country and reassure the people who voted against you? KAINE: That's a really important one. That may be the $64,000 question, because it has been a divisive campaign. And again, Hillary is running a campaign about stronger together, and Donald Trump -- and this is -- this is not directed at this man, except to the extent that he can't defend Donald Trump -- Donald Trump has run a campaign that's been about one insult after the next. But we do have to bring the country together. So here's what we'll do. Hillary Clinton was first lady, then senator for eight years and secretary of state. And I served in the Senate. And I'm really amazed, Elaine, as I talk to Republican senators, how well they regard and respect Hillary Clinton. She was on the Armed Services Committee. She was on other committees. She worked across the aisle when she was first lady to get the CHIP program passed so that 8 million low-income kids have health insurance in this country, including 150,000 in Indiana. She worked across the aisle after 9/11 to get health benefits for the first responders who bravely went into the towers and into the Pentagon. She worked to get benefits for -- TRICARE benefits for National Guard members, including Hoosiers and Virginians in the National Guard. She has a track record of working across the aisle to make things happen. And, you know, Elaine, I have the same track record. I was a governor of Virginia with two Republican houses. And in the Senate, I have good working relationships across the aisle. Because I think it's fine to be a Democrat or Republican or independent, but after Election Day, the goal is work together. And Hillary Clinton has a track record of accomplishment across the aisle that will enable her to do just that when we work with the new Congress in January. QUIJANO: Governor, how will you unify the country if you win? PENCE: Well, thank you, Elaine, and thanks for a great discussion... PENCE: ... tonight. Thank you, Senator. This is a very challenging time in the life of our nation. Weakened America's place in the world after the leadership of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on the world stage has been followed by an economy that is truly struggling, stifled by an avalanche of more taxes, more regulation, Obamacare, the war on coal, and the kind of trade deals that have put American workers in the back seat. I think the best way that we can bring people together is through change in Washington, D.C. You know, I served in Washington, D.C., for 12 years in the Congress of the United States. And I served with many Republicans and Democrats, men and women of goodwill. The potential is there to really change the direction of this country, but it's going to take leadership to do it. The American people want to see our nation standing tall on the world stage again. They want to see us supporting our military, rebuilding our military, commanding the respect of the world, and they want to see the American economy off to the races again. They want to see an American comeback. And Donald Trump's entire career has been about building. It's been about -- it's going through hardship just like a businessperson does and finding a way through smarts and ingenuity and resilience to fight forward and -- when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, we're going to have a stronger America. When you hear him say he wants to make America great again, when we do that, I truly do believe the American people are going to be standing taller. They're going to see that real change can happen after decades of just talking about it. And when that happens, the American people are going to stand tall, stand together, and we'll have the kind of unity that's been missing for way too long. QUIJANO: All right, gentlemen, thank you so much. This concludes the vice presidential debate. My thanks to the candidates, the commission, and to you for watching. Please tune in this Sunday for the second presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis and the final debate on October 19th at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. From Farmville, Virginia, I'm Elaine Quijano of CBS News. Good night."	1.0

(Ashraf Shazly/AFP/Getty Images)Michael Gerson and Raj Shah are senior fellows with Results for America and the authors of the “ Moneyball for Government ” chapter “Foreign Assistance and the Revolution of Rigor.” Gerson, an opinion columnist for The Washington Post, served as an assistant to President George W. Bush for policy and planning. Shah served as USAID administrator under President Barack Obama.We have entered the era of “America first” with only a vague understanding of its meaning. President Trump’s inaugural address signaled an ambitious nationalist reimagining of the post-World War II international order. Trump’s foreign policy team, in contrast, seems to spring from that order. The resulting uncertainty is global and dangerous. Vacuums of leadership are not generally filled by the good guys.The administration’s policy shift is most evident so far in the areas of trade and refugees — Trump prefers less of both. Given a narrowed conception of national interest and the president’s discomfort with the idea of “nation building,” foreign assistance would seem a natural next target. Persistent rumors that the administration is mulling major cuts at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) have heightened this speculation.Although Trump hasn’t spoken much on this topic, some of his comments have reflected an inclination to pull back. “It is necessary that we invest in our infrastructure, stop sending foreign aid to countries that hate us and use that money to rebuild our tunnels, roads, bridges and schools,” he said when he announced his candidacy. And in a March 2016 interview with the Washington Post editorial board , he said: “I watched as we built schools in Iraq and they’d be blown up. And we’d build another one, and it would get blown up. . . . And yet we can’t build a school in Brooklyn. We have no money for education, because we can’t build in our own country. And at what point do you say, hey, we have to take care of ourselves.”Yet Trump has also added notes of ambiguity. In August, he told the Miami Herald that Congress should increase funding to fight the Zika virus abroad. In September, he underlined the importance of ensuring clean water for everyone in the world. In October, he stated that “ we’re going to lead the way ” on AIDS relief.In this case, Trump’s better angels would do more to serve the country than his budget-cutters. Putting foreign assistance on the chopping block would be a serious mistake, by any definition of the national interest.***Let’s begin by getting the facts straight. Surveys have shown that many Americans assume the country spends upwards of 20 percent of the federal budget on foreign aid. In reality, nonmilitary foreign assistance — including all of America’s work on international development and global health — represents less than 1 percent of the federal budget . Slashing this tiny category of discretionary spending for the sake of budget control would be a form of deception — a sideshow to avoid truly important (and unpopular) budgetary choices.For less than 1 percent of the federal budget, the United States led a global coalition to fight HIV/AIDS when the disease threatened to devastate and destabilize much of the African continent . Battling another of the world’s most lethal killers, malaria , U.S.-led global programs have saved more than 6 million lives, mainly children under 5 years old. America also led a global effort to support agriculture when the food, fuel and financial crisis of 2008 pushed nearly 100 million people back into a state of chronic hunger and extreme poverty. As of 2015, that effort had directly benefited nearly 19 million rural households and reached more than 12 million children with nutrition programs . And America led a global partnership to bring power to half a billion people in Africa who have too often lived, worked, studied and given birth in the dark.This established impact runs up against a durable stereotype: that foreign assistance is routinely bundled in large bills and thrown down rat holes of waste and corruption. The charge is not entirely without historical root. During the Cold War, foreign assistance had some remarkable successes, including the Marshall Plan and the Green Revolution, but also notable failures such as aid to Vietnam and to dictators in Central America. In Africa, assistance sometimes went to strongmen such as Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, mainly because of a strategic chess game against the Soviet Union, not because he was spurring development.But over the past two decades and past two presidential administrations, health and development spending has evolved into a rigorous, innovative and professional enterprise dedicated to measured outcomes. Aid and development practitioners know how to set smart targets, engage private-sector partners, adapt to changing circumstances and make sure taxpayers get the most value for their investments. And they have evidence that what they are doing works.Most U.S. foreign assistance no longer even goes to foreign governments; It is given to U.S. companies and nonprofits in the form of contracts and grants; these organizations then implement projects in other countries, employing a combination of American and foreign staff members and often partnering with institutions of civil society.***But why does this emphasis on rigor and outcomes matter to U.S. foreign policy? How does foreign assistance serve definable American interests?Many of our most dangerous global challenges — such as terrorism, the drug trade and pandemic diseases — gather strength in countries, or regions within countries, that are poorly governed, often corrupt, and marked by high levels of poverty, hunger and disease. These places are incubators of risks to the United States. Consider Ebola, which took root in the weak health systems of West Africa and threatened our nation and the world with death and panic. Or the poverty and conflict in the Northern Triangle of Central America, which led to tens of thousands of child migrants trying to make their way to the United States on the tops of trains . Or the collapse of sovereignty in Syria, which helped produce the Islamic State and a radiating, destabilizing flood of refugees into Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and beyond. Or the weak governments of South America, which are often unable to halt the flow of drugs that enter our country.These are all very real consequences of poverty, instability and poor governance. But gains in hope, health and stability reduce these threats and better protect Americans. A forward-leaning Ebola response, employing America’s full epidemiological and humanitarian capacity, helped save lives in Africa and prevented the outbreak from spreading around the globe. In the Northern Triangle, our partnerships have helped reduce gang violence and stem the flow of unaccompanied minors to the United States. The Syrian crisis continues apace, but our massive humanitarian support for those displaced and in dire need reduces the pressure of refugee migrations to many nations, including our own.One of the best examples of the strategic role of aid has been in Colombia , where criminal gangs, violent conflict and the world’s largest production of cocaine threatened to destabilize the region and the world for decades. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the United States had a large security budget in Colombia and a small budget for development assistance. Then the Colombians embraced a greater focus on long-term development, which they integrated into their stabilization plans when territory was taken back from rebels. U.S. development assistance was increased, then integrated and properly sequenced with defense activities. As soon as landmines were cleared and local officials could safely return to liberated towns, USAID poured in assistance, which was crucial to consolidate gains. Those long-term investments are now paying off, supporting peace negotiations and helping to reintegrate former rebels and displaced civilians, in addition to improving business opportunities for U.S. firms. U.S. foreign assistance in Colombia gave stability and peace a fighting chance, and helped remedy a serious security problem for the United States and its allies.This type of foreign assistance is essential to preventing the kind of uncontainable strategic threats that might eventually require military intervention. (We are not talking here about humanitarian assistance, which should be driven entirely by the nature and scale of the need, or about direct military aid.) Defense Secretary Jim Mattis made a compelling case for conflict prevention when he was head of U.S. Central Command: “If you don’t fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition.” A small investment in foreign assistance today saves big on defense later.***An “America first” approach to foreign assistance could mean deploying foreign aid even more rigorously to help keep America safe, rather than a simple retreat.How do we create an aid system that uses big data to identify areas of weak governance that may produce global threats? One that systematically employs the full spectrum of assistance? One that uses information on measured outcomes to adjust policies and practices in real time? And one that ultimately builds local capacity to confront problems?There are specific actions the new administration can take to deliver on this vision. It should designate a “coordinator for development” who is empowered to ensure results from U.S. foreign assistance programs. This coordinator could be the new USAID administrator or the secretary of state himself — but it must be someone who sits at the principals table at the National Security Council and has the clear backing of the White House. He or she would need to review existing efforts and determine how they match rising threats. To avoid being just another layer of bureaucracy, such an official should be authorized to move budget resources between the State Department, USAID and the Defense Department as necessary to effectively prevent conflicts. Under these circumstances, aid should be categorized in the budget as national security spending, not “non-defense discretionary” spending. And the Trump national security team should make sure American leadership on these issues remains the bipartisan priority it has been for decades, starting with proposing and defending a strong budget commitment to these efforts right now.The next few months could mark a turning point for foreign assistance, and it matters greatly what kind. We could see the erosion of support for a cost-effective instrument of foreign policy and national influence — and we would see the consequences of such negligence later, probably in the form of military commitments — or we could see a reform that makes foreign assistance a reflection of American ideals and a rigorous instrument of American interests. The latter is a worthy and necessary goal for a great nation.Michael Gerson is a nationally syndicated columnist who appears twice weekly in The Post.	1.0

Here’s what he had to say:The problem we have today isn’t just that college is too expensive, it’s that college, our system, is outdated. We need a flexible system that allows people who have to work full time, like single mothers who are raising children and are working also need flexible ways to go back to school.Perhaps in his eagerness to criticize, Marco neglected to mention his long-time advocacy for and support of for-profit colleges . And Marco neglected to mention that his own proposed college affordability overhaul would specifically benefit for-profit colleges — institutions with a reputation for willfully misleading students, targeting veterans, in particular.Perhaps he forgot to mention his advocacy on behalf of Corinthian Colleges — a school that, according to Bloomberg Politics , “was fined $30 million by the Department of Education for a scheme involving ‘confirmed cases of misrepresentation of job placement rates’ for as many as 947 students.”Perhaps he forgot to mention that — according to Business Insider — his support of for-profit Corinthian Colleges has been a convenient boon for his campaign coffers:Corinthian Colleges, previously one of the largest for-profit colleges before it filed for bankruptcy this spring, gave $5,000 to Rubio’s Reclaim America PAC in 2014, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.Perhaps there is a specific reason that Marco Rubio — backed by for-profit colleges — would advocate higher-education reforms that benefit for-profit colleges.Rubio Support For For-Profit CollegesRubio Was A Long-Time Supporter Of “Alternative” Forms Of Higher Education. According to Bloomberg, “But that’s not the full story. Rubio is a noted supporter of ‘alternative’ forms of higher education, describing them in various speeches and statements as a way to help middle class Americans deal with rising tuition costs in an era where college degrees are increasingly vital to success.

I’m not that worried about the issue of costs. Yes, the Congressional Budget Office’s preliminary cost estimates for Senate plans were higher than expected, and caused considerable consternation last week. But the fundamental fact is that we can afford universal health insurance — even those high estimates were less than the $1.8 trillion cost of the Bush tax cuts. Furthermore, Democratic leaders know that they have to pass a health care bill for the sake of their own survival. One way or another, the numbers will be brought in line. The real risk is that health care reform will be undermined by “centrist” Democratic senators who either prevent the passage of a bill or insist on watering down key elements of reform. I use scare quotes around “centrist,” by the way, because if the center means the position held by most Americans, the self-proclaimed centrists are in fact way out in right field. What the balking Democrats seem most determined to do is to kill the public option, either by eliminating it or by carrying out a bait-and-switch, replacing a true public option with something meaningless. For the record, neither regional health cooperatives nor state-level public plans, both of which have been proposed as alternatives, would have the financial stability and bargaining power needed to bring down health care costs. Whatever may be motivating these Democrats, they don’t seem able to explain their reasons in public. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

Thus Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska initially declared that the public option — which, remember, has overwhelming popular support — was a “deal-breaker.” Why? Because he didn’t think private insurers could compete: “At the end of the day, the public plan wins the day.” Um, isn’t the purpose of health care reform to protect American citizens, not insurance companies? Mr. Nelson softened his stand after reform advocates began a public campaign targeting him for his position on the public option. And Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota offers a perfectly circular argument: we can’t have the public option, because if we do, health care reform won’t get the votes of senators like him. Honestly, I don’t know what these Democrats are trying to achieve. Yes, some of the balking senators receive large campaign contributions from the medical-industrial complex — but who in politics doesn’t? If I had to guess, I’d say that what’s really going on is that relatively conservative Democrats still cling to the old dream of becoming kingmakers, of recreating the bipartisan center that used to run America. But this fantasy can’t be allowed to stand in the way of giving America the health care reform it needs. This time, the alleged center must not hold.
