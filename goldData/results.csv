There were street demonstrations and flag-burnings in the Middle East. Libya joined Saudi Arabia in withdrawing its ambassador from Copenhagen. Islamic governments and organisations, including the Muslim Council of Britain, issued denunciations and a boycott of Danish goods took hold across the Muslim world. NI_MPU('middle');The Danish Government warned its citizens about travelling to Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Syria, and withdrew aid workers from the Gaza Strip. Last night EU foreign ministers issued a statement in support of Denmark, and the European Commission threatened to report any government backing the boycott to the World Trade Organisation. The fury echoed the outcry that followed the publication in 1988 of the Salman Rushdie novel The Satanic Verses. The trigger for the latest clash of cultures was the publication by the Danish newspaper Jyllends-Posten on September 30 of 12 cartoons of Muhammad. A biographer of the prophet had complained that no one would dare to illustrate his book, and the newspaper challenged cartoonists to draw pictures of the prophet in a self-declared battle for freedom of speech. One submission showed Muhammad wearing a bomb-shaped turban; in another he tells dead suicide bombers that he has run out of virgins with which to reward them. Any portrayal of Muhammad is blasphemous in Islam, lest it encourages idolatry. In October ambassadors from ten Muslim countries complained to Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the Danish Prime Minister, who refused to interfere with the presss freedom. But the issue began to boil this month after the cartoons appeared in Magazinet, a Christian newspaper in Norway, and on the website of the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet. Imams denounced Denmark from their pulpits, the Arab press inflamed pent-up Muslim anger at the West and last Friday the Saudi Government recalled its ambassador, but still Mr Rasmussen refused to apologise. He condemned attempts to demonise people because of religious beliefs, but argued: The Government can in no way influence the media. By yesterday governments across the Arab world were responding to public outrage. Libya closed its embassy in Denmark and the Egyptian parliament demanded that its Government follow suit. The Kuwaiti and Jordanian governments called for explanations from their Danish ambassadors. President Lahoud of Lebanon condemned the cartoons, saying his country cannot accept any insult to any religion. The Justice Minister of the United Arab Emirates said: This is cultural terrorism, not freedom of expression. In Gaza, gunmen briefly occupied the EU office in Gaza and warned Danes and Norwegians to stay away. Palestinians in the West Bank burnt Danish flags. The Islamic groups Hamas and Hezbollah and the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood demanded an apology. Supermarkets in Algeria, Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, Qatar, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen all removed Danish produce from their shelves. Arla Foods, a Danish company with annual sales of about $430 million in the Middle East, said that the boycott was almost total and suspended production in Saudi Arabia. The Muslim Council of Britain, whose leaders are to meet the Danish ambassador tomorrow, deplored the newspapers refusal to apologise for printing sacrilegious cartoons vilifying the Prophet Muhammad. Bill Clinton, the former US President, added his voice, telling a conference in Qatar that he feared anti-Semitism would be replaced with anti-Islamic prejudice. He condemned these totally outrageous cartoons against Islam. Per Stig Moeller, Denmarks Foreign Minister, insisted in Brussels last night: We condemn blasphemy. We want respect for religions. But we cannot intervene. We have sent explanations but, as we have said before, freedom of expression is a matter for the courts, not for the Government. A spokesman for Peter Mandelson, the EU Trade Commissioner, said that if the Saudi Government had encouraged the boycott of Danish goods, Mr Mandelson would take the matter to the WTO. Carsten Juste, editor-in-chief of Jyllends-Posten, which has hired extra security after staff received death threats, said that the drawings were not in violation of Danish law but have offended many Muslims, which we would like to apologise for. He added that the drawings were sober and were not meant to be offensive to Muslims.

People who have no faith in police responded with mob justice.05.21.17 11:00 AM ETPhoto Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily BeastMEXICO CITY—“Kill him! Kill him! Kill him,” chanted a mob of roughly 100 angry Mexicans in Cancun, the popular tourist destination on the coast of Quintana Roo, Mexico. “I’m going to decapitate you,” one man shouted at Aleksei Viktorovich Makeev, as the bloodied 42-year-old Russian resident of Mexico fled the interior of his home for a nearby rooftop while the mob pelted him with large rocks and jeered. When Makeev finally collapsed on the rooftop, covered in his own blood—and that of an unarmed teenager whom he stabbed moments before, after the teen attempted to enter the Russian’s apartment—the townspeople finally let him be, as reporters livestreaming from the scene claimed that Makeev had died.In fact, after being beaten with sticks and stoned nearly to death, the half-naked Russian was transported to a local hospital and treated for his injuries. The townspeople had fractured his skull.Makeev is now reportedly in stable condition, but remains in a drug-induced coma, paralyzed and likely brain-damaged, said Dmitry Bolbot, Mexico City’s Russian consul. But the 19-year-old youth whose last name has not yet been disclosed, “Lalo”—a nickname for Eduardo—bled out on the pavement as paramedics attempted to save his life. He was pronounced dead soon after Makeev stabbed him repeatedly in the stomach with a kitchen knife as he fled the home. The horrific stabbing was also caught on tape.“The Russian has just stabbed this person. He’s losing a lot of blood,” someone said in one of many livestreams of the hours-long encounter, as thousands of social media users watched from their phones and computers, leaving comments like “Cut off [the Russian’s] head! Toss him in a ditch,” and “Finish him off! Get it over with!”The mob descended on his home after local media reports began circulating on Friday about Makeev, who had spent the previous months uploading videos of himself on his personal YouTube channels surrounded by swastikas.In the videos, one can see that he had made a hobby of disparaging the people of Mexico, speaking with particular loathing about indigenous women and infants. He was dubbed #LordNaziRuso on social media—Lord Russian Nazi—and outrage quickly grew.Just past noon on Friday, Makeev posted on Facebook that he was “feeling adventurous,” along with the comment that “Terrorists are trying to kill me!”Hours later, he posted a crude drawing that read “lick my dick Mexican piece of shit” as he laughed at the angry crowd that had begun to phone him and cover his Facebook wall with angry comments.By dusk, as the mob formed outside the tiny one-room apartment in Cancun from which he often posted videos at his untidy desk—next to cans of peas and other food lining the windowsill— a local reporter with a drone began to film the lead-up to the lynching attempt, as Makeev sat at his desk and continued to poke the bear and mock the people online.From that desk—seated next to a family-size bottle of ketchup and more pictures of swastikas and promotional material for his unpopular YouTube channels—the Russian had repeatedly posted videos complaining about both the Mexican people and their police in a mix of Russian and the occasional insult in English or Spanish.Though he made himself completely unwelcome in Mexico, Makeev—who is originally from the small town of Elektrostal, on the outskirts of Moscow—had also previously made a name for himself in Russia where he was apparently put under review by the Ministry of Internal Affairs in 2013, after footage posted online showed him shoving an elderly woman and child. He was reportedly interned in a Russian psychiatric facility for his erratic behavior as a result.“If the government doesn’t want to do anything, if our authorities can’t, we’re going to get together and do this right,” said one man in a livestream Friday night, just before the lynching attempt began, inviting the people of Cancun to come down to the man’s home and get him. “We aren’t going to lynch him, because that sounds bad, but we are going to teach him a lesson.”“Cancun deserves respect,” the man said, adding, “It’s the most beautiful place you could ever imagine.”The bizarre videos Makeev became known for show his fanatical obsession with Madonna and knives, and that he far too often sat at the local McDonald's in Cancun, invasively filming humble Mexican diners— zooming in on the faces of what he called their “bastard” children, and referring to the people as “monkeys” and “pieces of shit.”In one video, filmed from a local rooftop, he stood shirtless next to a swastika and—wearing a clown nose—referred to “McDonald… Trump.” Many of his Facebook posts, in fact, relate to the various controversies involving the U.S. President’s alleged ties to Russia.He had been getting on people’s nerves for a while, but had made at least a few friends locally. Just two weeks ago, he uploaded a video of himself interviewing an American man who called himself Roy, who claimed to have been beaten by the local police, after picking up some cash from a local Western Union. He said the cops “took [his] $200,” stranding him in Mexico without a passport.“When I woke up, I’m on my hands and knees. And when I got up, I seen my teeth, so I picked ‘em up and put ‘em in my pocket, and the muth... uh, they had gone. They left. So, I was left with nothing, and I was left with this,” said a toothless Roy, pointing to a blackened right eye. “So I advise anyone coming here, be careful. The police are very corrupt.”It was a common theme in his videos. When not complaining about Mexicans, he complained about their cops.Last December, he was locked up for a month in an immigration center in Quintana Roo and declared persona non grata after repeatedly threatening the local Maya people . He complained in videos that he had not been given water, and had been treated poorly in detention. In a statement, the National Migration Institute said that Makeev’s “definitive exit from the country was ordered on January 19” of this year.But Makeev, who was previously employed as a scuba instructor at AquaWorld Cancun, remained in the country regardless. When contacted on Saturday, the watersports company was unable to offer any comment, but said in a statement that he stopped working with them in November 2015, after they noticed that “his behavior had begun to turn aggressive.”A statement reportedly from the Russian Embassy did not condone his actions in Mexico, but added that they “categorically reproach the manner in which Mexican citizens did not attempt to denounce [his actions] but instead took matters into their own hands,” asking Mexican authorities to help clarify these “unfortunate events.”But citizens and residents had reported his behavior to immigration authorities in recent months, even after his recent detention. One local radio disc jockey, 55-year-old Fabricio Rechy, provided The Daily Beast with screenshots of a conversation he had with immigration authorities this past February, in which he sends authorities the worrisome videos he had come across, requesting that the Russian be removed for posing a danger to the local people.During his conversation, the immigration employee at first implied that the videos were filmed in Russia, but the radio host pointed out that they were filmed inside the local McDonald’s. He even made it easy for them, providing screenshots of the man’s immigration documents.“They thanked me for the information and said they would investigate,” Rechy said in a telephone interview on Saturday. “But I doubt they gave it any importance.”“I stumbled on the videos, and saw the way he was threatening people, calling them shit, saying he was going to kill Mexicans, cut off their heads, and I thought he was a dangerous person, so I felt the need to report it. It’s my duty as a citizen,” he said. “There are videos that show him giving babies the middle finger, throwing coins at an old woman in a grocery store, hitting another elderly lady inside a bank, and stepping on children’s lunch on the beach.”As for the incident that ended one young man’s life on Friday night, Rechy said, “It never should have happened.”“The police arrived at night, but left saying they couldn’t do anything because the man was locked inside his home,” he said.Later that night, “about half an hour after the lynching started,” when the riotous fighting was well under way, the police finally returned with backup. But by then the situation had become unmanageable.As paramedics transported Makeev’s unconscious bloody body to the hospital late Friday night, smiling families cheered and screamed insults at him—at times chanting, “Mexico! Mexico! Mexico!”The National Immigration Institute said in a statement that it would seek his repatriation back to Russia as soon as his legal situation in Mexico is determined.But, Rechy noted, “None of this would have happened if they had just taken notice when I asked them to.”“That boy would still be alive,” he said. “Unfortunately, this is a national problem in Mexico—the lack of authority, and the authorities’ inaction. I hate to say it, but we are used to corruption here in Mexico.”“There just isn’t any trust,” he said. “People prefer to take justice into their own hands than deal with authorities. That’s how this works.”--------------------The Daily Beast’s Moscow-based correspondent Anna Nemtsova contributed to this report.READ THIS LIST",2017/01/30,snopes,1

According to social media postings by the current UT Austin student body president a student with a concealed handgun license saw the stabbing attack in progress, drew his firearm, and chased down the attacker. If true, there’s little doubt that the quick action on the part of this legally armed student may have stopped the attacker from injuring and possibly killing more people.UPDATE: Later reports from the same source indicate that the earlier report about an armed student are unconfirmed. However there is additional supporting evidence posted by another user on social media claiming to have been the CHL holder in question.Texas recently passed legislation enabling students with a concealed handgun license to carry their handgun in most areas of campus, excluding lab areas and other sensitive locations. A group of students and staff opposed this new legislation by forming the group Gun Free UT , organizing a dildo-filled “cocks not GLOCKs” protest , and proclaiming that carrying concealed handguns on campus will make UT less safe not more safe. There is no comment yet from Gun Free UT about this particular event.Making this story more interesting is the fact that the armed student reportedly stopped the mass stabber without firing a single shot. Concealed carry opponents constantly use the argument that civilians aren’t as well trained as police officers and will cause more harm than good in an emergency situation, but as this case illustrates that’s a complete and total fabrication. Even in the heat of the moment the CHL holder in this case understood that it was more dangerous to fire his gun in the middle of campus than to simply chase the mass stabber away.For those keeping score, organizations such as The Trace will refuse to classify this incident as a defensive gun use since the knife wielding attacker was not killed and no rounds were fired by the CHL holder.",2017/05/01,snopes,1

The new memorial will make good on President Trump's promise to bring about a peaceful resolution to the nearly 20-year contrived conflict.""President Trump is proud to declare victory in the War on Christmas,"" said a White House spokesman, who repeatedly asked that their name not be used. ""No longer will the celebration of Christmas be restricted to private homes, multiple 24/7 radio stations, non-stop television specials, Christmas themed commercials interrupting those television specials, decorations in every major retail outlet, proclamations from elected officials, and a federal holiday. Now that the War on Christmas is over, this cherished religious holiday can finally get the recognition it deserves. The President believes his victory in the War on Christmas will be among the greatest achievements of his presidency.""At the consecration ceremony for the new monument, President Trump is expected to issue an official proclamation establishing that ""Christmas"" will now refer to the entire period of time between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day.The proposed monument is expected to feature several installation pieces, each highlighting a different aspect of the War on Christmas. So far, the proposed monument includes:A memorial to everyone who was wished ""Happy Holidays"" by a department store cashier;An exhibition of anti-Christian Starbucks cups;A statue commemorating the ""Faceless Fox News Staffer,"" which will honor the unsung Fox News staff and interns who were forced to scour the internet for any story that could be plausibly spun to look like an attack on Christmas; andA life-size Nativity Scene.Following the announcement, the White House has been forced to respond to a litany of criticisms, including accusations that the monument constitutes religious favoritism and is ""wildly unnecessary.""""If you analyze this decision in the context of how the President and his cabinet view ‘religious freedom,' it makes a lot more sense,"" said the anonymous White House staffer before letting out a loud and heavy sigh. ""Like many of the President's policy decisions, this announcement comes following a meeting with the nation's leading religious right groups. The President shares their conviction that this monument will help reassert the principle of religious freedom, which is the inalienable right of every American to believe in conservative evangelical Christianity.""""This monument is as unnecessary as it is unsurprising,"" said Larry T. Decker, Executive Director of the Secular Coalition for America. ""This is a monument to religious privilege and a message that Christian supremacists should feel emboldened. What's next? Are we going to display the Ten Commandments in public schools? Or entomb a leader of the religious right in our nation's capital? Or mandate that a specific set of religious beliefs be treated like a get-out-of-jail-free card ? While a monument commemorating the War on Christmas is especially outlandish, would any of those hypotheticals really be any less galling?""HAPPY APRIL FOOLS DAY!",2018/03/30,snopes,1

However, authority websites including the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and the Mayo Clinic do not mention drinking water, when discussing treatments and lifestyle changes for hypertension.Why should some articles say that drinking water lowers blood pressure?The idea that drinking water will lower blood pressure seems to come from the idea that when lots of water is consumed, that sodium will be flushed out of the body and consequently pressure will drop.After all, several classes of diuretics are very effective at reducing pressure. These diuretics function by increasing the loss of sodium from the body and an increased volume of urine. Both the loss of sodium from the blood and decreasing the blood volume result in decreased blood pressure.So, if drugs, that effectively lower blood pressure in most people, work by increasing the volume of urine and the amount of sodium in the urine, then drinking more water should do the same thing?Unfortunately, there is a problem with this reasoning. To understand why, it is necessary to understand that the body very tightly controls the levels of fluid and ions such as sodium and calcium. For optimal functioning, the body has evolved a wide range of control processes that are involved in keeping many ions and fluid levels within a narrow range.Diuretics act on parts of the system that control sodium. For instance thiazide diuretics bind to, and inhibit, a protein called the Na/Cl symporter (Na=sodium, Cl=chloride) that controls the amount of sodium that is reabsorbed back into the blood from the urine that is being formed. The result is that the body recovers less sodium from the urine as it is being formed, and so more sodium is lost in the urine and there is a slight increase in volume. So diuretics affect the regulatory system and change a part of this.Water has no impact on the sodium or fluid control system so it will not change the total amount of sodium in the urine, or change the blood volume. Drinking more water will increase the volume of urine as the body regulates fluid levels, to keep the blood volume stable. Additionally, the same amount of sodium (and other ions etc.) in a bigger volume will lead to the urine being more dilute.Think about the color of urine. If not much fluid has been consumed, or there has been a lot of sweating, there will a small quantity of urine with a strong yellow color (from urobilin). If a person is well hydrated, there is more urine with a pale color. Same thing with sodium. In a healthy individual, the greater the volume of urine due to increased fluid consumption, the lower the concentration of sodium.So the bottom line is that, generally, increasing the amount of water that is consumed will not increase the amount of sodium lost by the blood, so blood pressure will not be lowered.In fact, drinking water can actually cause a very short term increase in blood pressure in some people, particularly those with some types of very low blood pressure. This is only temporary and has no long term impact on blood pressure.Keeping hydrated is good for health, but overhydration has no benefit for lowering blood pressure.Judith Airey PhD. is a biomedical researcher with a range of interests including all things cardiovascular.

Brown Jr. today ended the drought state of emergency in most of California, while maintaining water reporting requirements and prohibitions on wasteful practices, such as watering during or right after rainfall.“This drought emergency is over, but the next drought could be around the corner,” said Governor Brown. “Conservation must remain a way of life.” Executive Order B-40-17 lifts the drought emergency in all California counties except Fresno, Kings, Tulare and Tuolumne, where emergency drinking water projects will continue to help address diminished groundwater supplies. Today’s order also rescinds two emergency proclamations from January and April 2014 and four drought-related executive orders issued in 2014 and 2015. Executive Order B-40-17 builds on actions taken in Executive Order B-37-16 , which remains in effect, to continue making water conservation a way of life in California:The State Water Resources Control Board will maintain urban water use reporting requirements and prohibitions on wasteful practices such as watering during or after rainfall, hosing off sidewalks and irrigating ornamental turf on public street medians. The state will continue its work to coordinate a statewide response on the unprecedented bark beetle outbreak in drought-stressed forests that has killed millions of trees across California. In a related action, state agencies today issued a plan to continue to make conservation a way of life in California , as directed by Governor Brown in May 2016. The framework requires new legislation to establish long-term water conservation measures and improved planning for more frequent and severe droughts.Although the severely dry conditions that afflicted much of the state starting in the winter of 2011-12 are gone , damage from the drought will linger for years in many areas. The drought reduced farm production in some regions, killed an estimated 100 million trees, harmed wildlife and disrupted drinking water supplies for many rural communities. The consequences of millions of dead trees and the diminished groundwater basins will continue to challenge areas of the state for years.California’s Drought ResponseThe drought that spanned water years 2012 through 2016 included the driest four-year statewide precipitation on record (2012-2015) and the smallest Sierra-Cascades snowpack on record (2015, with 5 percent of average). It was marked by extraordinary heat: 2014, 2015 and 2016 were California’s first, second and third warmest year in terms of statewide average temperatures.The state responded to the emergency with actions and investments that also advanced the California Water Action Plan , the Administration’s five-year blueprint for more reliable, resilient water systems to prepare for climate change and population growth. To advance the priorities of the Water Action Plan and respond to drought, the voters passed a comprehensive water bond , the Legislature appropriated and accelerated funding and state agencies accelerated grants and loans to water projects.California also enacted the historic Sustainable Groundwater Management Act , took action to improve measurement and management of water, retrofitted tens of thousands of inefficient toilets, replaced lawns with water-wise landscaping and provided safe drinking water to impacted communities. Californians also responded to the drought with tremendous levels of water conservation, including a nearly 25 percent average reduction in urban water use across the state. ###",2017/04/18,snopes,1

His comment that Germany was controlled by Russia earned a rebuke from Berlin.“We are not prisoners, neither of Russia nor of the United States,” Germany’s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told reporters.TWO TRUMPSBut Trump was also at times enthusiastic and affable, exchanging embraces and handshakes with fellow leaders, posing for photographs in front of a NATO military band and mingling at a summit dinner in a Brussels museum.Related CoverageNATO formally invites Macedonia to join allianceUnlike a fraught Group of Seven summit in Canada in June, Trump did not block a final leaders’ statement, which paved the way for Macedonia to start NATO membership talks and a modernization of the alliance to better deter Moscow.Earlier, Trump strode into NATO’s new glass-and-steel headquarters and into the amphitheatre-like North Atlantic Council decision-making chamber to shake hands with leaders - but only after publicly railing against Germany, one of NATO’s top European powers, at a breakfast meeting with Stoltenberg.Trump told Stoltenberg Germany was wrong to support an $11-billion Baltic Sea pipeline to import even more Russian gas while being slow to meet targets for NATO spending.“We’re supposed to be guarding against Russia, and Germany goes out and pays billions and billions of dollars a year to Russia,” Trump said in the presence of reporters.“We’re protecting Germany, we’re protecting France, we’re protecting all of these countries. And then numerous of the countries go out and make a pipeline deal with Russia where they’re paying billions of dollars into the coffers of Russia,” he said. “I think that’s very inappropriate.”Trump appeared to substantially overstate German reliance on Russian energy and to imply Berlin was funding a pipeline that Chancellor Angela Merkel says is a commercial venture.She hit back by contrasting her own experience of growing up in Soviet-controlled East Germany with the sovereign, united Germany now playing a major role in NATO.Trump and Merkel later held businesslike talks on the sidelines. Trump said he had a “very, very good relationship” with Merkel who described the two as “good partners”.U.S. President Donald Trump attends a meeting of the North Atlantic Council during a NATO summit in Brussels, Belgium July 11, 2018. REUTERS/Francois LenoirA source close to French President Emmanuel Macron said Trump had voiced his “personal attachment” to Europe and gave “rather positive and constructive messages” to his allies.“There is no break-up between America and Europe,” the source said after Macron and Trump held “friendly” talks.WEAKENING BOND?But with tensions in the alliance smoldering over Trump’s trade tariffs on European steel, his earlier comments fueled concerns about the U.S. role in keeping the peace that has reigned since World War Two.Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel called for “fair play” and more respect for multilateralism.Baltic leaders, fearful of any repeat of Russia’s annexation of Crimea, called for unity, while Slovak President Andre Kiska said his country was “one of the good guys” because it was increasing defense spending.Those comments underscored the risks to Trump’s strategy by dividing allies between those who spend more on defense and those who do not, such as Belgium, Spain, Italy and Luxembourg, but who contribute with troops to NATO missions.NATO’s Stoltenberg later told reporters that Trump, who will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday, had used “very direct language” but that NATO spending was rising strongly.The NATO chief was also frank about the impact of Trump’s stance at a broader level.Slideshow (14 Images)“There are disagreements on trade. This is serious. My task is to try to minimize the negative impact on NATO,” he said.“So far it hasn’t impacted on NATO that much. I cannot guarantee that that will not be the case in the future.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/alien-mummy-baffles-scientists/,"an ""alien mummy"" was recently unearthed in a pyramid, and scientists cannot explain its origins.",False,['worldwide science stories'],https://outlook.wustl.edu/,https://outlook.wustl.edu/2007/summer/mummy.htm,2016/03/21,"Download the Baby Mummy graphic.For more than two decades, the baby mummy remained in a storage facility at the Saint Louis Science Center.One day last spring, Washington University scientist Charles F. Hildebolt got an intriguing phone call. A mummy had turned up in the storage facility of the Saint Louis Science Center (SLSC), but no one knew much about it. Could he and his colleagues do some detective work to learn more?""When you hear the word 'mummy,' you think big box or large tomb,"" says Hildebolt, DDS, PhD, a dentist and anthropologist in the Department of Radiology. ""It was a surprise when we got over there and found that this was a small child, partly unwrapped and in a little pine box. We said, 'Wow! This is really interesting.' But we didn't know exactly what we'd be able to find out.""Charles F. Hildebolt, DDS, PhD, enlisted the help of Li Cao, MD, center, and Anne M. Bowcock, PhD, to retrieve and analyze the baby mummy's DNA.Hildebolt and other volunteer investigators from the School of Medicine, helped by experts from around the world, began a yearlong quest to uncover the mummy's past. Assisted by the latest technology — sophisticated CT scanning, DNA analysis and radiocarbon dating — they pieced together a likely story of love and loss, of ancient Egypt and European conquerors, of theft and recovery, that has attracted international attention.At the same time, they made a bit of scientific history. Although the record of child mummies in existence is still incomplete, they are ""exceedingly rare,"" says Hildebolt. The extensive research they have done to understand this one may well rank, he says, ""as the most extensive work ever done on a child mummy.""What information they had when they began came from SLSC records. Around the turn of the last century, a dentist from Hermann MO was traveling in the Middle East when he acquired the mummy as a keepsake. Back home, a niece eventually inherited it, and she brought it out for display on Halloween. Her family donated it to the SLSC in 1985.For two decades, the small mummy remained in the SLSC storage facility until new vice president Al Wiman noticed it in 2006. ""The first thing I asked was 'What do you know about it?' Well, they knew it was a boy,"" he says today. ""'Do you know anything else?' No, they didn't.""Once Washington University agreed to help, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology was the first stop. Hildebolt, a veteran of other forensic detection efforts, recruited Kirk Smith, a senior research engineer with CT expertise. Smith did the full-body scanning, and Hildebolt and pediatric radiologist Steven Don, MD, studied the results in hopes of determining the child's age and cause of death.""It was just what a doctor would do with a living patient except that we could scan at a very high resolution, with an X-ray dose you would not use on a live person,"" says Smith. ""We also have state-of-the-art CT scanners, among the best in the world.""They captured some 1,000 CT slices, which Smith integrated for an overall look and segmented for close-ups. From the teeth and cranial sutures, Hildebolt and Don established the child's age: 7 to 8 months. They hypothesized that, in the tradition of Egyptian mummification, his organs had been removed through a hole in his left side and his brain through his left nostril. Within the mummy, they could see amulets at a tantalizing distance, but couldn't make out any inscriptions that might pinpoint the child's identity.Canopic jars (reproductions pictured here) were used to hold the dried internal organs of Egyptian mummies.So far, everything indicated an Egyptian place of origin, but how to prove it? Other cultures also mummified the dead. With the help of paleoneuroanatomist Dean Falk, PhD, from Florida State University, who confirmed the brain removal, they contacted Salima Ikram, PhD, an Egyptologist at the American University in Cairo. Snipping a postage-stamp-sized piece of the wrapping material, they sent it to Ikram, who passed it on to Emilia Cortés, a textile conservator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She determined it was Egyptian wrapping material from the Roman period in Egypt, around 2,000 years ago.Ikram unraveled other pieces of the mystery. True to Roman-period mummification custom, this mummy had a wooden rod placed at its back for support. The dark brown color of the body and the linen wrapping — turned gentle shades of beige in the CT scans — was the product of resins and oils used in the 70-day mummification process. As to the mummy's origin, Ikram says, it ""definitely"" came from a grave that was plundered by robbers, ""but several sites are possible, so I shall not speculate.""Sadly, its very existence may point to sorrow that resonates through the centuries. The parents of this child were wealthy, since they could afford to mummify their child, and they were likely heartbroken at their loss.""This was certainly a loved child,"" says Hildebolt, ""for the family to go to the cost, trouble and time to have him mummified.""But the investigation also left some questions unanswered. Since the bones showed no injury, the team still does not know the cause of death. At first the skull seemed a bit enlarged, possibly due to hydrocephaly, but Don's measurements proved it was within the normal range. And who were the parents? Would further testing corroborate the mummy's time period?With funding from the SLSC, university researchers sent another swatch of wrapping to a laboratory for radiocarbon dating; with 95 percent certainty, the results showed a close match. This baby lived sometime between 40 BC and 130 AD, at the end of the Macedonian-Egyptian period of control and the beginning of Roman rule under Caesar Augustus.""So this child could easily have been alive at the same time as Cleopatra, Marc Antony, Julius Caesar and Octavian,"" says Hildebolt.To trace the baby's roots, they contacted Washington University geneticist Anne M. Bowcock, PhD, who enlisted researcher Li Cao, MD, to help retrieve and analyze DNA. This process was fraught with problems. For one thing, they needed to find uncontaminated DNA, deep inside the body. For another, the mummy was rock hard, yet they didn't want to damage it. Using instruments designed for spinal punctures, they bored into its bone through existing holes in the skin, extracting samples from several sites.Targeting the mitochondrial DNA, they amplified and sequenced their samples, checking the results with Douglas C. Wallace, PhD, of the University of California-Irvine, a mitochondrial expert. Next came a major surprise: This kind of DNA, provided by the maternal side, showed that this child's mother came of European lineage — perhaps a Roman or Greek living in Egypt. So far, the researchers have not been able to amplify the child's nuclear DNA, which would show the father's lineage.More questions linger, but the ""Child Mummy,"" as the SLSC calls it, has generated an excited response from visitors, who have flocked to the new permanent exhibit.The respectful treatment given this long-ago child also pleases Ikram. ""I am delighted with the results,"" she says, ""and feel that the ancient Egyptians would have been, too.""",2015/09/17,snopes,1

In the aftermath of the Islamic State attack that killed 130 people in Paris, he’s claimed—without evidence of truth—that “thousands” of Muslims were cheering the 9/11 attacks on rooftops in New Jersey, and he’s seemed to suggest that he would support a registry of all Muslims in the U.S. And just days after the attack by two apparently-radicalized terrorists in San Bernadino, Trump has tried to outflank his Republican rivals, most of whom have called for rejecting refugees fleeing Syria because of security concerns.Yet Trump’s constitutionally-questionable call to place an explicit religious test on immigration and travel goes far beyond his previous statements.For one, this was not an off-the-cuff remark, a response to a vague question, or even an idle retweet. Trump detailed his new position in a written statement sent to hundreds if not thousands of reporters covering the campaign. And it apparently extends beyond immigrants to Muslim-American citizens living overseas. It includes “everyone,” Hope Hicks, a campaign spokeswoman, told The Hill .“Without looking at the various polling data, it is obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension. Where this hatred comes from and why we will have to determine,” Trump said in his initial statement.Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life.The statement amounts to a sharp rebuke of President Obama’s plea, delivered in an Oval Office address on Sunday night, that the nation “reject discrimination” against Muslims. “It is our responsibility to reject religious tests on who we admit into this country,” Obama said. “It’s our responsibility to reject proposals that Muslim Americans should somehow be treated differently. Because when we travel down that road, we lose.""Trump’s call for a ban on Muslim immigration and travel drew swift and angry responses from candidates in both parties, as well as the White House.. @realdonaldtrump removes all doubt: he is running for President as a fascist demagogue.— Martin O'Malley (@MartinOMalley) December 7, 2015Condemnations from Republicans quickly followed. Jeb Bush tweeted that Trump had become “unhinged.” John Kasich said Trump’s “outrageous divisiveness” was more reason why he was “entirely unsuited” to be president. Senator Lindsey Graham, a long-shot Republican rival, tweeted that Trump had “gone from making absurd comments to being downright dangerous with his bombastic rhetoric.”He’s putting at risk the lives of interpreters, American supporters, diplomats, & the troops in the region by making these bigoted comments— Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) December 7, 2015Another Senate Republican, Jeff Flake of Arizona, wrote that “just when you think [Trump] can stoop no lower, he does.” The White House responded on Twitter by posting a quote, in all-caps, of Obama’s call to rejected religious tests.Of the immediate Republican candidate reactions, it was Trump’s closest competitor in Iowa, Ted Cruz, who had the mildest response. “That is not my policy,” he reportedly said in South Carolina, before repeating his preference for a three-year moratorium on refugees coming from countries with an ISIS or al Qaeda presence.The survey that Trump cited, by a D.C. think tank started by a former adviser to Ronald Reagan, was repudiated by a group at Georgetown University that tracks Islamophobia. “This survey should not be taken seriously,” the organization wrote in June after the survey was cited by Bill O’Reilly on Fox News.It comes from an organization with a history of producing dubious claims and “studies” about the threat of shariah, and was administered using an unreliable methodology. Its proponents seize upon its shoddy findings, exaggerating and misrepresenting them to American audiences, and falsely claim that the survey data represents the views of Muslims nationwide.Trump’s call for banning all Muslim immigrants came hours after a Monmouth University survey found that the GOP frontrunner is now trailing Ted Cruz in the important early-voting state of Iowa. The poll-obsessed Trump ignored that survey and instead tweeted a different Iowa poll showing him in the lead.We want to hear what you think about this article.

It is usually awarded around April 15 (Day of the Sun, the birthday of Kim Il-sung). Kim Jong-il was its first recipient. With the issuance of Decree 2150 by the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly on February 3, 2012, the Order of Kim Jong-il was created for the 70th anniversary of his birth. The order measures 67mm in length and 65mm in width. It features the portrait of Kim Jong-il in the center of golden ear of rice above a shining five-point star, the flag of the DPRK below and the emblem of the Workers' Party of Korea above with an engraving of ""Order of Kim Jong-il"" on the back with pin and serial number. It is made to give commendation to officials, service personnel, working people, military units, organs, enterprises, and organizations who made distinguished services for the DPRK. The order ribbon is similar to the Order of Kim Il-sung in the color and the star at the center, but its design is different. Until the creation of the Order of Kim Il-sung in 1972, the highest order of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The ONF was based on the awarding criteria as the Soviet Order of the Badge of Honor. Order ribbon has 2 gold stripes indicating 2nd Class. Order ribbon has 3 small gold stripes indicating 3rd Class. For efficient and meritorious professional labour. Conferred to flag officers and navy commanders for outstanding leadership. Conferred to flag officers and navy commanders for outstanding leadership. The original screwplate or pin back awards were given to Division, Corp or Army field commanders for achievement in battle.

I’m 18 years old, Cuban and bisexual. I’m so indecisive that I can’t pick a favorite color, and I’m allergic to 12 things. I draw, paint, crochet, sew, embroider—anything productive I can do with my hands while watching Netflix.But none of this matters anymore.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowWhat matters is that the majority of American people have become complacent in a senseless injustice that occurs all around them. What matters is that most American politicians have become more easily swayed by money than by the people who voted them into office. What matters is that my friends are dead, along with hundreds upon hundreds of others all over the United States.Emma pictured at a Valentine’s Day event at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, an hour before the shooting on February 14Rain ValladaresThis started with, has been about, will always be for, all of us. And who are we? We are the people who died in the freshman building on Valentine’s Day at Douglas High, and the people who died in every mass shooting in U.S. history. We are everyone who has been shot at, grazed or pierced by bullets, terrorized by the presence of guns and gun violence in America. We are kids, we are parents, we are students, we are teachers. We are tired of practicing school shooter drills and feeling scared of something we should never have to think about. We are tired of being ignored. So we are speaking up for those who don’t have anyone listening to them, for those who can’t talk about it just yet, and for those who will never speak again. We are grieving, we are furious, and we are using our words fiercely and desperately because that’s the only thing standing between us and this happening again.I have talked so much in the past few days that sometimes I feel like I might have used up all my words and I’ll never speak again. And then I hear someone say something really stupid and I can barely keep myself from snapping in two.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowWe are children who are being expected to act like adults, while the adults are proving themselves to behave like children“If you have ever lost someone very important to you, then you already know how it feels, and if you haven't, then you cannot possibly imagine it,” wrote Lemony Snicket in The Bad Beginning: A Series of Unfortunate Events. There are people who do not know, and will never know, what it feels like to go through this. For that I am eternally thankful. But to the people out there who disagree with us: if you have ever felt what it's like to deal with all of this, you would know we aren’t doing this for attention. If these funerals were for your friends, you would know this grief is real, not paid for. We are children who are being expected to act like adults, while the adults are proving themselves to behave like children.When did children become such a dirty word? Adults are saying that children are lazy, meanwhile Jaclyn Corin organized an entire trip to Tallahassee, three busses stuffed with 100 kids and reporters who went to discuss our pitiful firearm legislation with the people who can—but won’t—do something about it.Adults are saying that children are emotional. I should hope so—some of our closest friends were taken before their time because of a senseless act of violence that should never have occurred. If we weren’t emotional, they would criticize us for that, as well. Adults are saying that children are disrespectful. But how can we respect people who don’t respect us? We have always been told that if we see something wrong, we need to speak up; but now that we are, all we're getting is disrespect from the people who made the rules in the first place. Adults like us when we have strong test scores, but they hate us when we have strong opinions.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowI’m constantly torn between being thankful for the endless opportunities to share my voice, and wishing I were a tree so that I’d never have had to deal with this in the first place.

You don’t drive a NASCAR on the street, no matter how fun it might be, just like you don’t need an AR-15 to protect yourself when walking home at night. No one does.Emma pictured last year during Pride week at schoolCourtesy of Emma GonzalezAt the end of the day, we don’t want people to have their guns taken away. We just want the people to be more responsible. We want civilians to have to go through more rolls of red tape to get what they want, because if any of that tape can stop those who shouldn’t own a gun from owning a gun, then our government will have done something right. All we want to do is go back to school. But we want to know that when we walk onto campus, we won’t have to worry about the possibility of staring down the barrel of a gun. We want to fix this problem so it doesn’t occur again, but mostly we want people to forget about us once this is over. We want to go back to our lives and live them to the fullest in respect for the dead.Teachers do not need to be armed with guns to protect their classes, they need to be armed with a solid education in order to teach their classes. That’s the only thing that needs to be in their job description. People say metal detectors would help. Tell that to the kids who already have metal detectors at school and are still victims of gun violence. If you want to help arm the schools, arm them with school supplies, books, therapists, things they actually need and can make use of.One more thing. We want increased mental health care for all those who need it—including the angry, frustrated men who almost always commit these crimes. Mental illness and gun violence are not directly correlated, but when the two go hand in hand, Americans—often children—lose their lives. We don't need the NRA's excuses, we need the NRA to finally stand up and use its power to supply the American people with something they deserve. (And please note, when members of the March for Our Lives movement talk about the NRA, we are referring to the organization itself, not the members. Many of the members understand and support our fight for responsible gun ownership, despite the organization preventing common sense gun laws from being instituted in the name of protecting the second amendment—rather than the American people.)Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowSo march with us on March 24.

The tears soaking Cristy's face were not the first she'd cried since her baby boy's complicated delivery on December 11th. She had been induced four days prior to his birth and struggled through 53 hours of labor. By the time he began to crown, not even Cristy's determination could overcome her exhaustion. The doctor told her to stop pushing.We don't know why the doctor didn't elect to perform a c-section earlier on. We don't know if her decision to use suction during the final moments of Dakota's birth was a wise one. What we know is that immediately after delivery, he began suffering one seizure after another.The small-town North Dakota hospital wasn't equipped to care for the newborn, so they life-flighted him to a hospital in the state's capital of Bismarck. His worried dad and even his exhausted mom left the hospital immediately and drove to Bismarck to be with their baby boy.A neurologist discovered Dakota's skull was fractured and bleeding in the brain was soon detected. The doctors have since learned that the bleeding is coming from a place deeper in the brain than initially thought.The good news amidst all of this heartache is that Dakota is showing himself to be a fighter! Today, instead of receiving sustenance through a feeding tube as he has been since birth, Dakota nursed (and nursed and nursed...!). This was the first time his mom was able to hold him.The road ahead to health is long. It would help so much if his parents could stay together in Bismarck until Dakota can come home with them. That means time off work, the added expense of staying in a town far from home and family support--not to mention the cost of medical care and the life flight, which goes far above and beyond what their medical insurance provides.Any financial help you can give this sweet, young family would be a tremendous blessing. As we learn more about Dakota's health, we will update this site, so you can keep Dakota, Cristy and Bobby in your thoughts and prayers.Thank you,",2015/02/27,snopes,1

The report suggested that Cambridge Analytica had essentially issued questionnaires through a third party; those questionnaires, which were personality quizzes, requested that you use your Facebook login. Cambridge Analytica then compiled data regarding those who completed the quiz and cross-referenced that data with political preferences in order to target potential voters.This isn’t particularly shocking. In 2012, The Guardian reported that President Obama’s reelection team was “building a vast digital data operation that for the first time combines a unified database on millions of Americans with the power of Facebook to target individual voters to a degree never achieved before.” ADVERTISEMENTWhat, exactly, would Obama be doing? According to The Guardian, Obama’s new database would be gathered by asking individual volunteers to log into Obama’s reelection site using their Facebook credentials. “Consciously or otherwise,” The Guardian states, “the individual volunteer will be injecting all the information they store publicly on their Facebook page — home location, date of birth, interests and, crucially, network of friends — directly into the central Obama database.” Facebook had no problem with such activity then. They do now. There’s a reason for that. The former Obama director of integration and media analytics stated that, during the 2012 campaign, Facebook allowed the Obama team to “suck out the whole social graph”; Facebook “was surprised we were able to suck out the whole social graph, but they didn’t stop us once they realized that was what we were doing.” She added , “They came to [the] office in the days following election recruiting & were very candid that they allowed us to do things they wouldn’t have allowed someone else to do because they were on our side.”Not so with Trump. As soon as Facebook realized that Cambridge Analytica had pursued a similar strategy, they suspended the firm.Again, this isn’t surprising. Since Trump’s election, Democrats — in search of a rationale for their favored candidate’s defeat — have blamed a bevy of social media outlets. Senate Democrats trotted out pathetic Russian-created memes on Facebook, viewed by a handful of human beings, as an excuse for Hillary’s loss; Democrats claimed — without evidence — that “fake news” had swamped Facebook and thus led to Trump’s victory. Democrats have also insisted that Facebook be regulated. Sen.

And in February, Zuckerberg said he wanted to re-jigger the algorithms on his platform to benefit content that Facebook deems “trustworthy, informative, and local.” Wired celebrated: “You can’t make the world more open and connected if you’re breaking it apart.”The result of Facebook’s algorithmic changes: conservatives have been slammed. And that’s the point. A study from The Western Journal found that conservative sites have lost an average of 14 percent of their Facebook traffic; leftist sites saw a minor increase. Even major publications saw that effect: The New York Daily News saw a bump of 24.18 percent, while the New York Post dropped 11.44 percent.And that’s the goal in covering Cambridge Analytica, and Russian interference on Twitter, and all the rest — even without any serious information suggesting that such interference shifted votes, the left can rest assured that its Silicon Valley allies will act to de-platform Republicans and conservatives. There’s a reason Twitter has suspended alt-right racists but continued to recommend that others follow Louis Farrakhan; there’s a reason YouTube is being sued by Prager University; there’s a reason Google used automatic fact-checking on right-wing sites but did no such thing for left-wing sites.We’re in the midst of a radical reshifting in social media. Ironically, the people who have stumped against regulation — conservatives — are those being targeted by social media companies. If companies like Facebook, YouTube, Google and Twitter don’t start acting like platforms again rather than like motivated left-wing outlets, Republicans likely won’t let principle outweigh practicality for long.Ben Shapiro ( @BenShapiro ), a lawyer and conservative commentator, is founder and editor in chief of The Daily Wire .

Women can now vote in municipal elections, work in some retail and hospitality jobs and were allowed to compete in the Olympics for the first time in 2012.However Saudi Arabia was still ranked 141 of 144 countries in the 2016 Global Gender Gap, a World Economic Forum study on how women fare in economic and political participation, health and education.The system of make guardianship, which requires women to obtain permission from a guardian - father, husband, or son - to travel, study or marry is an impediment to realizing women’s rights, say rights groups.“Male guardianship is un-Islamic and humiliating for women,” said Akeel. “Some (men) take advantage of this male guardianship for their own benefit and abuse it.”Reporting by Heba Kanso @hebakanso, Editing by Belinda Goldsmith and Ros Russell; Please credit Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women’s rights, trafficking, property rights, and climate change.

While we expect battery capacity to decrease as batteries age, we expect processor performance to stay the same. However, users with older iPhones with lower-than-expected Geekbench 4 scores have reported that replacing the battery increases their score (as well as the performance of the phone). What’s going on here? How many phones are experiencing decreased Geekbench 4 score?To answer these questions I’ve plotted the kernel density of Geekbench 4 single-core scores for the iPhone 6s and the iPhone 7 running different versions of iOS. Scores obtained in low-power mode are not included in the distribution.iPhone 6sHere are the charts for the iPhone 6s:The distribution of iPhone 6s scores for iOS 10.2.0 appears unimodal with a peak around the average score. However, the distribution of iPhone 6s scores for iOS 10.2.1 appears multimodal, with one large peak around the average and several smaller peaks around lower scores. Under iOS 11.2.0 the effect is even more pronounced.iPhone 7Here are the charts for the iPhone 7:The distribution of iPhone 7 scores under iOS 10.2.0, iOS 10.2.1, and iOS 11.1.2 appears identical. However, the distribution changes with iOS 11.2.0 and starts to look like the iPhone 6s distribution from 10.2.1.Performance and Battery AgeSo what’s going on here?First, it appears the problem is widespread, and will only get worse as phones (and their batteries) continue to age. See, for example, the difference between the distribution of iPhone 6s scores between 10.2.1 and 11.2.0.Second, the problem is due, in part, to a change in iOS. The difference between 10.2.0 and 10.2.1 is too abrupt to be just a function of battery condition. I believe (as do others) that Apple introduced a change to limit performance when battery condition decreases past a certain point. Why did Apple do this? kadupse on Reddit offers the following explanation:Many iPhone 6s devices were shutting down unexpectedly, even after the battery replacement program (Which many people weren’t entitled to use). Because degraded batteries last much less and end up with a lower voltage Apple’s solution was to scale down CPU performance, it doesn’t solve anything and is a bad experience… but it’s better than having your device shutdown at 40% when you need it the most.Apple acknowledged the sudden shutdown issue that affected the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s earlier this year. However, does the same issue affect the iPhone 7? Apple appears to have added a similar change to iOS 11.2.0 for the iPhone 7.If the performance drop is due to the “sudden shutdown” fix, users will experience reduced performance without notification. Users expect either full performance, or reduced performance with a notification that their phone is in low-power mode. This fix creates a third, unexpected state. While this state is created to mask a deficiency in battery power, users may believe that the slow down is due to CPU performance, instead of battery performance, which is triggering an Apple introduced CPU slow-down. This fix will also cause users to think, “my phone is slow so I should replace it” not, “my phone is slow so I should replace its battery”. This will likely feed into the “planned obsolescence” narrative.John Poole is the Founder of Primate Labs and lives in Toronto, Ontario.Products",2017/12/18,snopes,1

The study has helped create a crucial breakthrough in the field.“So that’s the thing,” added Dr Hetfield. “I analyzed micro-lensing in gravitationally lensed quasars to yield measurements of the structure of their continuum emission regions. I first described our lensed quasar monitoring program and RETROCAM, the auxiliary port camera I built for the 2.4m Hiltner telescope to monitor lensed quasars.

One was a night-time panorama of a radio telescope at Warkworth, taken last year for an online photo challenge; the other was a shot of the ""supermoon"" - when the moon is at its closest point to the Earth, making it looker bigger than usual - taken from Kerikeri a few months ago.He combined the two so the moon was resting perfectly in the radio dish and, chuckling to himself, uploaded the result to his Flickr page and an online photo competition called 500px.

Trump's highly anticipated foreign policy speech Wednesday will test whether the Republican presidential front-runner, known for his raucous rallies and eyebrow-raising statements, can present a more presidential persona as he works to unite the GOP establishment behind him. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)The Donald Trump campaign continued railing against the judge who is presiding over the fraud case against the mogul’s university, linking his past membership in a Latino lawyers’ group as a reason to doubt his objectivity.Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson on Monday said that Judge Gonzalo Curiel had been member of a group that has been overtly against her candidate.""I think what's really interesting about this particular judge — as Mr. Trump refers to him as a 'Trump hater' — is he even mentions on his judicial questionnaire that he was a La Raza Lawyers Association member,"" Pierson said in an interview on CNN.Trump has been trying to get Curiel off the fraud case against Trump University since 2014.At a campaign rally on Friday in San Diego, Trump denounced Curiel’s handling of the case, which involves two class action suits that accuse Trump University of deceptive practices against customers who were promised insight into the mogul’s strategies for succeeding in real estate.The lawsuit overseen by Curiel states that Trump University's nationwide seminars and classes were like infomercials and pressured students to buy more but didn't deliver as promised in spite of students paying as much as $35,000 for seminars.The Washington Post reported that Curiel's order to release an estimated 1,000 pages of Trump University-related documents cites heightened public interest in Trump and that he had ""placed the integrity of these court proceedings at issue."" The judge appeared to reject the argument by Trump attorneys that the information had commercial value, saying that there was no support for the assertion that Trump University may resume operations.Trump assailed the judge’s scheduling for a trial to begin in November. The candidate already was displeased with Curiel's decision last year to accept the court complaints against Trump University as class-action suits.""The trial is going to take place sometime in November,” Trump said at the rally. “There should be no trial. This should have been dismissed on summary judgment easily, everybody says it. But I have a judge who is a hater of Donald Trump, a hater. He's a hater.”""The judge, who happens to be, we believe, Mexican, which is great. I think that's fine.""It was the second time this year Trump tried to link the judge's ethnicity to his ability to be impartial in the case. In February, Trump said in an interview on ""Meet the Press"" that Curiel's Hispanic heritage was a reason the judge was not ruling in his favor in the case.The judge was born and raised in Indiana. His parents came from Mexico, according to various published reports.Pierson defended Trump’s comments, which many later criticized as unfair and bigoted, saying the judge’s ethnicity was irrelevant and should not have been singled out. She also questioned the judge’s involvement with the National Council of La Raza, a national civil rights group.""This is an organization that has been out there organizing anti-Trump protesters with the Mexican flags,” Pierson said, “they are pushing it. The signs have been very apparent. And so Mr. Trump is just stating the obvious.""Trump has attacked Mexico as a country that dumps drug dealers and other criminals along the U.S.-Mexico border. A cornerstone of his campaign has been that he will crack down on illegal immigration. He has vowed to build a huge wall that he says he will force Mexico to fund, and also has vowed to have a mass deportation to expel the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States.The CNN interviewer told Pierson that the judge is American-born.Pierson said she was not sure of his ethnic origin, but argued that it was relevant.""Well, it's because of what we see outside of these rallies, these anti-Trump rallies, these criminal rallies, these criminal protesters out there defacing property and attacking police officers,"" Pierson said. ""They're doing so under the guise of an anti-Trump protest, with their Mexican flags, and La Raza and this judge is connected to that.""Curiel is not permitted to address Trump’s attacks.He has said only that during the civil case against Trump University, the mogul has become a leading presidential candidate who “placed the integrity of these court proceedings at issue.”Earlier in his career, Curiel prosecuted drug smugglers and cartel leaders, a mission that made him a target of assassination attempts and required him to live under tight security.In 1997, for example, a gunman for a Tijuana drug cartel spoke in a bugged conversation of being willing and able to arranged Curiel’s murder, according a Los Angeles Times story from that year.A 2002 New York Times story credited Curiel with being one of the key figures in one of the U.S.’s most important victories in the fight against drug smuggling across the border.As a chief drug prosecutor in the late 1990’s, Curiel and other law enforcement officials in California of Mexican descent were able to use their Spanish-language skills and knowledge of the culture to win the trust of their police counterparts in Mexico and identify the corrupt officials who were sabotaging U.S.-Mexico efforts to crack down on the drug cartels.“According to participants on both sides, the Mexicans looked across the table at Mr. Chavez, Mr. Vega and Mr. Curiel, all born of Mexican parents, and the spark of recognition lit a fire,” the Times story said.''It couldn't but help,'' Mr. Curiel said to the Times in 2002. ''We were working without the disconnect of interpreters and barriers of culture. When it comes down to it, this involves the country of our parents.''The Associated Press contributed to this report.Like us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter & InstagramTrending in Politics",2016/05/31,snopes,1

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/eighth-russian-tied-to-trump-dies/,an eighth russian with ties to the trump-russia scandal has mysteriously died.,Unproven,"['donald trump', ' russia']",http://talkingpointsmemo.com/,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/new-development-on-the-michael-cohen-peace-plan-meeting,2017/03/10,"March 4, 2017 7:12 pmThere is a startling new development in the ongoing Trump/Russia story.Last week I wrote about Michael Cohen and his extensive network of personal and business relationships in the Ukrainian-American emigre community. One of those was a man named Alex Oronov, who runs a major agribusiness concern in Ukraine. Oronov was a partner in the ethanol business Cohen and Cohen’s brother Bryan set up in Ukraine about a decade ago. Oronov is Bryan Cohen’s father-in-law. Today we learned that Oronov apparently organized that ‘peace plan’ meeting that brought together Ukrainian MP Artemenko, Cohen and Felix Sater . About four hours ago Andrii Artemenko, the Ukrainian parliamentarian who came to New York with that ‘peace plan’, went on Facebook to announce that Alex Oronov has died.(I was first alerted to Artemenko’s post by Natasha Betrand of Business Insider who has been all over this story.)The rest of the post is a sort of pained rant, blaming Oronov’s death on the reporting of The New York Times. The Times you’ll remember published the story on Feb. 19 describing the meeting between Artemenko, Michael Cohen and Felix Sater. Artemenko describes himself as a pawn caught up in a war between the Times and Donald Trump and said the stress created by the article and the subsequent press attention was too much for Oronov to bear.A notable detail is that Artemenko says that it was Oronov who arranged the meeting described in that initial story by the Times. Here is a loose translation courtesy of a friend who is a Russian speaker: “Yes, I’m guilty …. Alex Oronov, my partner, my friend, my mentor, Alex was a family member of Michael Cohen. And he organized all kinds of stuff, including an introduction and a meeting for me with Michael Cohen.”The remembrance website legacy.com has a listing for an Alex Oronov who died on March 2. The date of birth, June 9, 1948, matches the date of birth listed on Oronov’s Florida voter registration records . The condolence page also has one well-wisher describing selling farm equipment to Oronov for transshipment to Ukraine. So there’s little doubt that this is the Alex Oronov associated with Michael Cohen. A person who answered the phone Saturday night at an address associated with Oronov’s daughter told TPM the family had no comment.More Edblog",2017/03/05,snopes,1

That's a good explanation for my last trip to the hospital.I've been running a footrace with piled-up years and bad living habits, and they have pulled even and will soon be ahead. I know it may not seem to normal people that writing three columns a week requires any hard work, but it does require energy to do the research and an alertness of the mind that I can no longer muster. Hence, this will be my last column.It's been a difficult decision to make. In one sense, I'm not sure there even is a Charley Reese without the column, but I would rather quit now than reach a point where editors and readers know that I should quit. Those of you who have read my column have made me a sort of guest in your home, and I don't want to overstay my welcome.I don't intend to croak, but that's not something we can control. I have some tidying up to do. One of the things I have to do is to say a heartfelt thanks to the readers and to the editors. I've stirred my share of controversy, and the easiest solution to controversy is to simply drop the column. I greatly admire those editors who stuck with me. I deeply appreciate the loyalty of my readers. The sales reps and the staff at King Features are the best in the business. I feel honored to have been associated with them. To them, freedom of the press is not a slogan.I've had a good run. In 1955, when I started as a reporter, newspaper city rooms were full of tobacco smoke, alcoholics, glue pots, steel rulers, copy pencils, and typewriters. There was a lot of profanity and an occasional fistfight. Editors excelled in sarcasm. But they taught me how to write clear sentences.One afternoon when I reported in, I asked an editor if he would like to get a cup of coffee. He glared at me and said, ""Reese, I just spent $15 getting a buzz on, and I ain't about to ruin it with a [expletive] 10-cent cup of coffee.""Today's newsrooms look more like insurance offices. Computer keyboards don't make much noise. If the reporters smoke anything at all, it's not tobacco. Instead of greasy grills, most newspapers have salad bars. I'm sure H.L. Mencken would have seen salad bars as a sure sign of decline.John McCain can have the last laugh, since I've said several times that he's too old to be the president. He is, even if he is more durable than I am. There are some who will celebrate my going, and it galls me to give them that pleasure. I was never ambitious, but I've always been competitive and pugnacious.At any rate, it's a great time to be an American. George W. Bush, who turned out to be a gift to comedians but a blunderer of the first order, will soon be out of office. It is historic and a good sign that a black man, Barack Obama, can win the nomination of a major party. When I started in the business, the South was still segregated, and blacks were invisible both as employees and as subjects of news stories, with the exception of crime stories.The great advantage of a free society is the capacity to self-correct itself. You'd think dictators would have figured that out, but if they are not paranoid when they seize power, they become so trying to hang on to power.Well, enough random thoughts. My goal as a columnist has always been to stimulate and, if necessary, provoke people into thinking for themselves. If we fail to do that, a free society won't last.

A 1974 report co-authored by Ginsburg did address the constitutionality of prohibitions on prostitution and did refer to legislation that set the age of consent at 12 years. But Ginsburg did not assert a position on either issue, as Media Matters for America previously noted in response to a nearly identical claim made by Wall Street Journal columnist Manuel Miranda.During an interview with Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) on the October 31 edition of Fox News' Hannity & Colmes, Hannity brought up what he called the ""Ginsburg rule"" -- commonly known as the ""Ginsburg precedent."" This is the deceptive argument -- hatched shortly after the nomination of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. -- that Senate Republicans responded to Ginsburg's 1993 nomination by putting aside their ideological differences and not requiring her to answer questions that would signal how she would decide future cases, thereby establishing a precedent for the opposition party's handling of future Supreme Court nominees. Hannity went on to detail Ginsburg's ""very left-wing"" record:HANNITY: I guess where I am on this, if you look at Ruth Bader Ginsburg, I mean, she -- the Ginsburg rule, she doesn't have to answer specific questions, clearly pro-choice going in, thinks there may even be a constitutional right to polygamy, has a controversial view we should lower the age of consent to 12, supports legalized prostitution, very left-wing.But Hannity's claims regarding Ginsburg's views on prostitution and the age of consent rely on a distorted reading of her 1974 report titled "" The Legal Status of Women Under Federal Law ."" On the issue of prostitution, the report read : ""Prostitution as a consensual act between adults is arguably within the zone of privacy protected by recent constitutional decisions."" While Hannity and Miranda have misconstrued this sentence as an argument in favor of constitutional protection for prostitution, Ginsburg was merely stating that an argument could be made that such activity is protected by the Constitution. Indeed, during her 1993 confirmation hearing, when Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) noted this passage , Ginsburg highlighted the presence of the term ""arguably."" Hatch went on to concede that the sentence could not be construed as a stated position: ""You were making an academic point. I understand. I'm not trying to indicate that you were justifying prostitution.""The claim that Ginsburg put forth the ""controversial view we should lower the age of consent to 12"" is also false. In a section of the 1974 report objecting to the ""traditional sex discriminatory fashion"" in which the United States Code defined rape, Ginsburg cited a 1973 Senate bill as an example of legislation that better ""conform[ed] to the equality principle."" One of the three circumstances that the bill established as constituting rape read as follows: ""the other person is, in fact, less than twelve years old."" But Ginsburg was noting with approval only the measure's gender-neutral language; she never directly addressed the clause regarding ""age of consent."" In a September 16 column taking issue with this particular criticism of Ginsburg, Slate.com's Timothy Noah wrote: ""What, then, is Ruth Bader Ginsburg's true crime? In discussing how to rewrite the federal law addressing statutory rape, Ginsburg failed to state an opinion about what the age of consent should be.""Short Link",2007/10/10,snopes,0

It's still roiling immigration reform.The Minuteman Project, which had civilians guard the border, has all but disappeared. But it stoked a movement that continues to influence the immigration reform debate.Khampha Bouaphanh/AP/FileMinuteman volunteers listen to the national anthem during a Minuteman Project rally on April 1, 2006, near Three Points, Ariz.Loading...By Lourdes Medrano CorrespondentTucson, Ariz.In just a few years, perhaps the most visible civilian attempt to stop illegal immigration has all but disappeared amid the changing dynamics of the debate.A little less than a decade ago, the Minuteman Project and the copycats it spawned arrived at the Arizona border with binoculars and American flags, vowing to defend the country from what they described as an invasion. At their height, the Minutemen were the face of a conservative insurgency that would later lend its energy to the emergence of the tea party.To like-minded Americans, they were patriots. To critics, they were dangerous vigilantes.Today, however, they have largely vanished. The recession took its toll, it seems, making an expensive enterprise impractical for workaday crusaders. So did infighting within the groups, as well as shifts in immigration patterns.But the Minutemen were also victims of their own success, helping to forge a strident new movement against illegal immigration that continues to shape the political debate today. In a very real way, the Minuteman Project has lost momentum because politicians in state capitols and Congress have taken the lead. While several states from Arizona to Alabama have passed strong anti-illegal immigration laws, Republicans in the US House of Representatives have blocked comprehensive immigration reform legislation.Immigration reform: If Obama moves on his own, how big a political risk?""The energy passed from the so-called citizen border patrol groups to state legislatures,"" says Mark Potok, an expert on militias and antigovernment groups at the Southern Law Poverty Center, in Birmingham, Ala. In 2010, the center documented 319 groups active in Arizona and other parts of the Southwest border that, often armed, confronted people suspected of being in the country illegally. By 2013, the number had dwindled to 33.""The movement is one-tenth the size that it used to be,"" says Mr. Potok.In rural southeast Arizona, once a hotbed for militia-type patrols that began in the early 2000s, the absence is noticeable.""We haven't had any contact with anyone identifying themselves as a militia and acting in that capacity for maybe the past two years,"" says Carol Capas, a spokeswoman for the Cochise County Sheriff's Department.On occasion, those in search of illegal activity make their presence known. In August, authorities in central Arizona arrested a man they accused of pointing a gun at a Maricopa County sheriff's deputy in a desert miles from the border that is well known for the smuggling of people and drugs.But by one important measure, the groups have already triumphed. They brought more attention to the border and illegal immigration, says Louis DeSipio, a political scientist at the University of California at Irvine.""They offered a visual image to what was, for some, a sort of abstract debate,"" he adds.Various factors contributed to the decline of the movement. The Minuteman Project itself, which secured the national spotlight in 2005, eventually succumbed to infighting and controversy. Criminal elements with ties to the organization caused damage, as did associations with people espousing white supremacy. Chris Simcox, a former leader of the movement, awaits trial in Phoenix on sexual-assault charges, while another leader, Shawna Forde, remains behind bars after being convicted and sentenced to death on murder charges linked to the killing of a 9-year-old girl and her father during a home invasion in southern Arizona.On a basic level, maintaining a movement whose members came from various parts of the country was always going to be difficult, says Lisa Garcia Bedolla, a political scientist at the University of California at Berkeley.A sharp drop in illegal border crossings, as well as the economic downturn, probably accelerated the collapse of the groups, she says.""It's probable that the people who are doing the watching have fewer resources; it takes money to take the time to sit there. And then you also have the changes in the migration patterns.""Although border security and anti-immigration sentiments prevailed even before the Minutemen came along, the image of members dressed in military-style clothes represented ""a very visual reaction to a sense of insecurity and fear,"" she says.""The rhetoric was already there, they were just taking it to an extreme,"" Professor Garcia Bedolla adds. ""Maintaining that extreme takes a lot of resources, it takes a lot of energy.""At their height, Minuteman-style groups enjoyed a clout that reached far beyond their membership numbers. ""It certainly wasn't them alone. If it had been them alone, the border vigilantes wouldn't have succeeded,"" Professor DeSipio says.Despite their relatively low numbers, the groups were able to rally other like-minded individuals, including prominent talk show hosts with large audiences.""In that, they were overwhelmingly successful, if we think about how strident the anti-immigrant organizing is now,"" he adds.DeSipio notes that the rise of the Minuteman movement coincided with the last time Congress attempted (and failed) to pass comprehensive immigration reform.In 2006, the House and Senate each approved legislation that addressed border security and the potential legalization of the estimated 12 million people in the country illegally. But the House and Senate proved unable to bridge the differences between the two proposals, and the attempts for reform crumbled.""People who would've have, maybe, voted for a compromise on immigration suddenly realized that their votes were at risk, so they moved away from immigration reform,"" he says.Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.Since then, numerous border watchers have gravitated toward the rising tea party and begun spreading their anti-immigration-reform message through political channels.

Joe Kennedy III is Democrats’ pick to respond to President Trump’s State of the Union speech. That could be a problem, given his big pharma ties.Rep. Kennedy (D-Massachusetts) might be pharma’s favorite Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives, given that he’s received more than $57,000 from the pharmaceutical/health products industry in this current election cycle alone. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, that’s approximately four times more than pharma’s average contribution to House Democrats. Over the course of his short Congressional career, Kennedy has received more than $348,000 since 2011 .However, Kennedy’s ties to pharma go well beyond campaign contributions. As the Boston Globe reported last year, Rep. Kennedy has more than $434,000 invested in Gilead Sciences, Inc. Gilead is the manufacturer of life-saving hepatitis C drug Sovaldi — which Gilead recently increased to $1,000 per pill , or $84,000 for a treatment. Rep. Kennedy’s financial disclosure forms show that he made between $15,000 and $50,000 off of selling Gilead stock in 2014. Kennedy bought Gilead’s stock at a time when hepatitis C was spreading rapidly throughout Massachusetts. He also holds the most Gilead stock out of all 23 members of Congress financially invested in the company.The multiple financial ties Kennedy has to pharma may help provide context to his hesitation to embrace single-payer healthcare and legalized marijuana. In a September 2016 interview with Boston Magazine — just two months before Massachusetts voters would approve a ballot question legalizing the sale of marijuana for recreational purposes — Rep. Kennedy came out against legalized marijuana using the tired “think about the children” trope.“If we’re going to say marijuana is a medicine, it needs to be treated like a medicine and regulated like a medicine,” said Rep. Kennedy. “But when we look at full-on legalization, the potential danger that marijuana poses particularly to adolescents—I’m not convinced.”And during an interview with Boston Public Radio last September, Rep. Kennedy would only rhetorically support the House version of the single-payer healthcare bill authored by former Rep. John Conyers (R-Michigan) co-sponsored by more than 100 members of his own party, but chalked up his hesitation to the finer details of the plan.“I think [the bill’s cosponsors] are 100 percent right on the value that they are trying to enshrine in the federal law, that health care is a right in this country, not a privilege to be enjoyed by few,” Kennedy told WGBH. “There are some details, however, in that Conyers bill that I do have some struggles with, and [I’m] trying to work through a bit. If we can get there, then great, but regardless, healthcare is critically important to me, and I believe fundamentally in that principle, and we’ll keep pushing forward.”Kennedy is the grandson of former Attorney General and U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and grand-nephew of former President John F. Kennedy. President Trump will give his State of the Union address on Tuesday, January 30. Rep. Kennedy’s response will come shortly afterward.

But the discovery of fetal DNA in women’s brains is. (credit: Jay Shendure lab)“Some women actually have men on the brain” beckoned the headline from the LA Times on September 27, echoing an article in PLoS One describing the discovery of male fetal DNA in the brains of pregnant women. It was “an astonishing finding,” according to the newspaper, necessitating “a new paradigm of the biological self” according to lead author J. Lee Nelson of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the University of Washington.I suspect Dr. Nelson was quoted out of context, for the idea of two genetically distinct populations of cells, or their DNA, residing in one individual isn’t new. It’s called microchimerism.From Mythology to MicroscopyA microchimera (“small mosaic”) is a downsized version of the Greek chimera, a mythical beast that had the head of a lion, a she-goat body, and a dragon tail. Woody Allen redefined chimera in the 1973 film Sleeper as a creature with “the body of a crab and the head of a social worker.”Medical chimerism arises after a transfusion or transplant, and it may follow pregnancy. Our microbiomes, the bacteria within us, are more like guests than body parts..Dr. Nelson’s group found Y chromosome DNA sequences in several brain regions in autopsy slides from 37 out of 59 women. Such DNA liberated from fetal cells can come from several sources: children, fetuses that never made it to be born, older siblings, or twins. Both son and daughter DNA partake in this “feto-maternal trafficking,” but female DNA, at the chromosomal level, is harder to detect amid the maternal two X’s.“It isn’t surprising that Y-bearing cells are in the brain because they’re in lots of other organs. We’d already shown Y sequences in the cerebrospinal fluid of women at the time of delivery. When they had spinal anesthesia, we collected a bit of spinal fluid and assayed it for male DNA,” Diana Bianchi, MD, executive director of the Mother Infant Research Institute and a professor of pediatrics, obstetrics & gynecology at the Tufts University School of Medicine told me. She and her team knew the Y DNA had come from sons because they witnessed the births. Y sequences have also been found in the brains of mouse moms .A Great Paper — From 1893The earliest hint of the possibility of fetal remnants in maternal bodies is in a 1893 publication by German pathologist Georg Schmorl. Dr. Bianchi and her colleagues offer a “21st century re-appraisal” of the paper in the journal Placenta .Dr. Schmorl autopsied 17 women who’d died during or shortly after childbirth, from the convulsions of eclampsia. “Very peculiar” big, blobby, cells had lodged in the tiny blood vessels snaking through the women’s lungs, and elsewhere. The odd cells were merged, their nuclei nestled at the centers like clutches of frog’s eggs.The cells resembled cells from only two places: bone marrow or placenta. Because there wasn’t evidence the women had bled, the placenta was a more likely source, Dr. Schmorl hypothesized. Could powerful uterine contractions have shaken the cells loose, like an earthquake toppling bricks from a wall? He wondered if placental cells also slip into the bloodstreams of healthy pregnant women.To test his hypothesis, Dr. Schmorl made a placenta soup from rabbits and dogs, and injected the material into other animals. Most of them died, usually from convulsions. And most had clots, typically in the blood vessels of the lungs. Just like the women.Fetal Cells in Moms Are CommonJump to 1969. A paper in The Lancet reported Y chromosomes in the bloodstreams of 21 of 30 pregnant women; 19 of the 21 delivered boys. The other 2 women had older sons who could have left genetic remnants of their time in utero. In those days before use of fluorescent DNA probes to clearly distinguish chromosomes, Janina Walknowska and colleagues painstakingly eyeballed the one cell in thousands that picked up crude stains for the tiny yet distinctive Y chromosome.In 1979, Dr. Bianchi and her group used fluorescence-activated cell sorting to detect cells bearing surface markers from the father, representing the fetus, in the blood of pregnant women as early as 15 weeks. This work complemented the Y chromosome study.Then in 1996, the Bianchi group found that fetal-to-maternal microchimerism persists well past pregnancy, something probably evident in Dr. Schmorl’s slides, had he the tools to look. The researchers looked at surface antigens and Y-chromosome DNA sequences in the blood of 32 pregnant women and from 8 nonpregnant women. The eight who weren’t pregnant had all had sons, 6 months to 27 years prior .Of the 19 women who had sons, 13 had male DNA. Four of the 13 women who delivered girls had male DNA, which came from pregnancies past — 2 sons and 2 terminations. Six of the 8 nonpregnant women had male DNA, including the mother of the 27-year-old man.The conclusion: pregnancy sets up “a long-term, low-grade chimeric state in the human female.” And because it happens more often than not, the fetal cells are probably adaptive, perhaps dampening the pregnant woman’s immune response against the fetus.Fetal blood cells are found in the circulation of a quarter of pregnant women during the first trimester, and in 40 to 70% of them by the third trimester. I, with three daughters and no brothers, lack the Y-tagged variety. My brain is free of male DNA and that must be why I hate football and readily ask for directions.Non-Invasive Prenatal TestingCells aren’t the only signs of a fetus — on average, about 10% of the free-floating DNA fragments in a pregnant woman’s bloodstream come from the fetus – and only the one currently in residence, not from a prior pregnancy. These pieces are perfect for prenatal testing.At least three companies already offer such tests, called NIPT (non-invasive prenatal testing). Ariosa Diagnostics , Sequenom , and Verinata Health . They use two approaches (massively parallel signature sequencing and directed analysis) to spot two or three of the most common trisomies (13, 18, and 21). The California Technology Assessment Forum is currently evaluating the impact of NIPT. Early reports indicate that the approach can indeed successfully stand in for riskier amniocentesis.It’s even possible to amplify and overlap cell-free fetal DNA from maternal bloodstreams to assemble full fetal genomes . And it all circles back to the 1893 report, because women with pre-eclampsia have five times the normal amount of cell-free fetal DNA.The Body Turning to StoneI was familiar with fetal cells in maternal bodies not in the blood or brain, but in skin. In 1998, Carol Artlett, then at Jefferson Medical College, discovered fetal cells and DNA in the skin of women suffering from systemic sclerosis (aka scleroderma).Patients, most of whom are women between ages 45 and 55, describe the connective tissue disorder as “the body turning to stone.” Joints swell, fingers stiffen, and the face becomes masklike. The hardening may spread to the lungs, esophagus, and blood vessels.Several clues point to fetal cells inappropriately stimulating the maternal immune response in the disease:• Systemic sclerosis is much more common among women.• Symptoms resemble those of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), in which a transplant attacks the recipient’s body. A fetus is like grafted foreign tissue.• The cell surfaces of mothers who have systemic sclerosis and their sons are more alike than those of unaffected mothers and their sons. Did fetal cells similar to those of their mothers-to-be lie beneath the radar of her immune surveillance, persisting silently in the skin until some unknown event uncloaked them?The discovery of fetal cells in maternal skin revealed a novel way to develop an autoimmune condition, and that’s why the PLoS One paper didn’t seem like news to me. But I can understand why finding male DNA in female brains made headlines.It would be nice, though, if, in the haste to disseminate or package news, reporters could look to the past. They’d find that nearly all medical “breakthroughs” – from transplants to chemotherapy to monoclonal antibodies to gene and stem cell therapies and even to yesterday’s news about tinkering with the mitochondrial DNA in human eggs -– took years, even decades, and the efforts of many scientists, not one or two groups. (I think I’m a little more sensitive to news not being new because I write textbooks.)Tracing the backstory can be just as intriguing as reporting the news.Post navigation",2012/10/25,snopes,0

For myself, I really love albino pythons. They can get to be massive though, so you really need the funds and space to keep them happy and healthy.A good place to look for an albino snake for sale is in the classifieds. I have found some great deals on snakes from owners who aren't capable of looking after their pets any longer.Also, you can check out the local animal shelter and see if they have any albino snakes on hand. You would be surprise at how often snakes get confiscated from people.wanderPost 1There are so many kinds of snakes to choose from when you are looking at snakes for sale. I have wanted a snake as a pet for years, but my roommates have always been squeamish about me keeping a snake in the house. Now that I am heading out on my own I think it is time I got my own albino snake.I have found that when an albino corn snake for sale advertisement pops up, they usually go for under $50, which makes them a really cheap pet in comparison to things like cats and dogs. Plus, the food for them is pretty inexpensive considering that a few mice can keep a snake going for 5-15 days depending on its size.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Hello, everybody. Great to be back in New York with all of our friends and some great friends outside the building, I must tell you. I want to thank all of our distinguished guests who are with us today, including the members of our cabinet: Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin and OMB Director Mick Mulvaney and the Transportation Secretary who is doing a fabulous job, Elaine Chao. Thank you all for doing a really incredible and creative job on what we're going to be discussing today, which is infrastructure. We've just had a great set of briefings upstairs on our infrastructure agenda. My administration is working every day to deliver the world class infrastructure that our people deserve and frankly our country deserves. That’s why I just signed a new Executive Order to dramatically reform the nation's badly broken infrastructure permitting process. Just blocks away is the Empire State Building. It took 11 months to build the Empire State Building. But today it can take as long as a decade and much more than that. Many, many stories where it takes 20 and 25 years just to get approvals to start construction of a fairly routine highway. Highway builders must get up to 16 different approvals involving nine different federal agencies governed by 29 different statutes. One agency alone can stall a project for many, many years and even decades. Not only does this cost our economy billions of dollars, but it also denies our citizens the safe and modern infrastructure they deserve. This overregulated permitting process is a massive, self-inflicted wound on our country. It’s disgraceful. Denying our people much needed investments in their community, and I just want to show you this, because it was just shown to me. I think I'm going to show it to the media – both real and fake media by the way. This is what it takes to get something approved today. Elaine, you see that? So this is what it takes, permitting process flow chart. That's a flow chart. So that can go out to about 20 years, this shows about ten. But that can go out to about 20 years to get something approved. This is for a highway. I have seen a highway recently in a certain state – I won’t mention it’s name, it is 17 years. I could have built it for $4 million, $5 million without the permitting process. It costs hundreds of millions of dollars, but it took 17 years to get it approved and many, many, many, many pages of environmental impact studies. This is what we will bring it down to. This is less than two years. This is going to happen quickly, that's what I'm signing today. This will be less than two years for a highway, so it's going to be quick, it's going to be a very streamlined process, and by the way, if it doesn't meet environmental safeguards, we are not going to approve it – very simple. We’re not going to approve it. So this is – maybe this one will say, let's throw the other one away. Would anybody like it from the media? Would anybody like that long, beautiful chart, you can have it. The most reliable politics newsletter. Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning — in your inbox.

So my Executive Order also requires agencies to work together efficiently by requiring one lead agency for each major infrastructure project. It also holds agencies accountable if they fail to streamline their review process, so each agency is accountable. We're going to get infrastructure built quickly, inexpensively, relatively speaking and the permitting process will go very, very quickly. No longer will we tolerate one job killing delay after another. No longer will we accept a broken system that benefits consultants and lobbyists at the expense of hard working Americans. Now, I knew the process very well – probably better than anybody. I had to get permits for this building and many of the buildings I built. All of the buildings I built in Manhattan and many other places, and I will tell you that the consultants are rich people. They go around making it very difficult. They lobby congress, they lobby state government, city governments to make it very difficult so that you have to hire consultants and that you have to take years and pay them a fortune, so we’re streamlining the process, and we won't be having so much of that anymore. No longer will we allow the infrastructure of our magnificent country to crumble and decay, while protecting the environment we will build gleaming new roads, bridges, railways, waterways, tunnels and highways. We will rebuild our country with American workers, American iron, American aluminum, American steel. We will create millions of new jobs and make millions of American dreams come true. Our infrastructure will again be the best in the world. We used to have the greatest infrastructure anywhere in the world, and today, we are like a third-world country. We are literally like a third-world country. Our infrastructure will again be the best, and we will restore the pride in our communities, our nation. And all over the United States, we will be proud again, so I want to thank everybody for being here. God bless you, God bless the United States. If you have any questions, Mick, you could come up here, please. Come on up. Mick Mulvaney. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. REPORTER: Why are the CEOs leaving your manufacturing council? TRUMP: Because they are not taking their job seriously as it pertains to this country. We want jobs, manufacturing in this country. If you look at some of those people that you are talking about, they are outside of the country. They are having a lot of their product made outside. If you look at Merck as an example, take a look where – excuse me, excuse me – take a look at where their product is made. It is made outside of our country. We want products made in the country, now I have to tell you, some of the folks that will leave, they’re leaving out of embarrassment, because they made their products outside, and I have been lecturing them, including the gentleman that you are referring to, about you have to bring it back to this country. You can't do it necessarily in Ireland and all of these other places. You have to bring this work back to this country. That's what I want. I want manufacturing to be back into the United States so that American workers can benefit. REPORTER: Why did you wait so long to denounce neo-Nazis? TRUMP: I didn't wait long. I didn’t wait long. I didn’t wait long. I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct, not make a quick statement. The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement, but you don't make statements that direct unless you know the fact. And it takes a little while to get the facts. You still don't know the facts. And it is a very, very important process to me. It is a very important statement. So I don't want to go quickly and just make a statement for the sake of making a political statement. I want to know the facts. If you go back to my statement, in fact I brought it. I brought it. As I said on remember this, Saturday, we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence. It has no place in America. And then I went on from there. Now here is the thing. Excuse me, excuse me. Take it nice and easy. Here is the thing, when I make a statement, I like to be correct. I want the facts. This event just happened. A lot of the event didn't happen yet as we were speaking. This event just happened. Before I make a statement, I need the facts, so I don't want to rush into a statement. So making the statement when I made it was excellent. In fact, the young woman who I hear is a fantastic young woman and it was on NBC, her mother wrote me and said through I guess Twitter, social media, the nicest things, and I very much appreciated that. I hear she was a fine, really actually an incredible young woman, but her mother on Twitter, thanked me for what I said. Honestly, if the press were not fake and if it was honest, the press would have said what I said was very nice. – excuse me – unlike you and unlike the media, before I make a statement, I like to know the facts. TRUMP: They didn’t, they didn’t. They don’t. TRUMP: How about, how about, how about a couple of infrastructure questions. REPORTER: The CEO of Walmart said you missed a critical opportunity to help bring the country together. Did you? TRUMP: Not at all. I think the country -- look, you take a look. I've created over a million jobs since I have been president. The country is booming, the stock market is setting record, we have the highest employment numbers we’ve ever had in the history of our country. We are doing record business. We have the highest levels of enthusiasm, so the head of Walmart, who I know, who’s a very nice guy, was making a political statement. I mean, I would do it the same way, you know why? Because I want to make sure when I make a statement that the statement is correct. And there was no way – no way – of making a correct statement that early. I had to see the facts, unlike a lot of reporters, unlike a lot of reporter. I didn't know David Duke was there. I wanted to see the facts. And the facts, as they started coming out, were very well-stated. In fact, everybody said his statement was beautiful. If he would have made it sooner, that would have been good. I couldn't have made it sooner, because I didn't know all of the facts. Frankly, people still don't know all of the facts. It was very important – excuse me, excuse me. It was very important to me to get the facts out and correctly. Because if I would have made a fast statement and the first statement was made without knowing much other than what we were seeing. The second statement was made after it with knowledge, with great knowledge. There are still things – excuse me. There are still things that people don't know. I want to make a statement with knowledge, I wanted to know the facts, okay. REPORTER: Two questions: was this terrorism? And can you tell us how you are feeling about your Chief Strategist Steve Bannon? TRUMP: I think the driver of the car is a disgrace to himself, his family and this country. And that is – you can call it terrorism, you can call it murder. You can call it whatever you want. I would just call it as the fastest one to come up with a good verdict. That’s what I’d call it. And there is a question. Is it murder? Is it terrorism? Then you get into legal semantics. The driver of the car is a murderer, and what he did was a horrible, horrible, inexcusable thing. REPORTER: Can you tell us how you are feeling about your chief strategist, Mr. Bannon? Can you talk about that? TRUMP: I never spoke to Mr. Bannon about it. REPORTER: Can you tell us broadly about – do you still have confidence in Steve? TRUMP: Well, we’ll see. And look, look, I like Mr. Bannon. He is a friend of mine, but Mr. Bannon came on very late. You know that. I went through 17 senators, governors and I won all the primaries. Mr. Bannon came on very much later than that, and I like him. He is a good man. He is not a racist – I can tell you that. He is a good person, he actually gets very unfair press in that regard. We'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon. He’s a good person, and I think the press treats him frankly very unfairly. REPORTER: They have called on you to defend your national security adviser H.R. McMaster against these attacks. TRUMP: I did that before. Senator McCain? Senator McCain. You mean the one that voted against Obamacare? Who is Senator McCain? You mean senator McCain who voted against us getting good health care? REPORTER: Senator McCain said that the alt-right is behind these attacks, and he linked that same group to those that perpetrated the attack in Charlottesville. TRUMP: Well, I don't know. I can't tell you. I'm sure Senator McCain must know what he is talking about, but when you say the alt-right, define alt-right to me. You define it. Go ahead. Define it for me, come on, let's go. REPORTER: Senator McCain defined them as the same group. TRUMP: Okay, what about the alt-left that came charging at [indiscernible] – excuse me – what about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, the alt right? Do they have any semblance of guilt? TRUMP: What about this? What about the fact that they came charging – they came charging with clubs in their hands swinging clubs? Do they have any problem? I think they do. TRUMP: As far as I’m concerned, that was a horrible, horrible day. Wait a minute, I'm not finished. I'm not finished, fake news. That was a horrible day. TRUMP: I will tell you something. I watched those very closely, much more closely than you people watched it. And you had, you had a group on one side that was bad. And you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. And nobody wants to say that, but I'll say it right now. You had a group – you had a group on the other side that came charging in without a permit, and they were very, very violent. REPORTER: Do you think what you call the alt left is the same as neo-Nazis? TRUMP: Those people – all of those people, excuse me – I've condemned neo-Nazis. I've condemned many different groups, but not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch. TRUMP: Those people were also there, because they wanted to protest the taking down of a statue Robert E. Lee. So – excuse me – and you take a look at some of the groups and you see, and you’d know it if you were honest reporters, which in many cases you’re not. Many of those people were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee. So this week, it’s Robert E. Lee, I noticed that Stonewall Jackson’s coming down. I wonder, is it George Washington next week? And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after. You know, you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop? TRUMP: But, they were there to protest – excuse me – you take a look the night before, they were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee. Infrastructure question. Go ahead. REPORTER: Does the statue of Robert E. Lee stay up? TRUMP: I would say that’s up to a local town, community or the federal government, depending on where it is located. REPORTER: Are you against the Confederacy? REPORTER: On race relations in America, do you think things have gotten worse or better since you took office with regard to race relationships? TRUMP: I think they’ve gotten better or the same – look – they have been frayed for a long time, and you can ask President Obama about that, because he’d make speeches about it. I believe that the fact that I brought in, it will be soon, millions of jobs, you see where companies are moving back into our country. I think that's going to have a tremendous positive impact on race relations. We have companies coming back into our country. We have two car companies that just announced. We have Foxconn in Wisconsin just announced. We have many companies, I’d say, pouring back into the country. I think that's going to have a huge, positive impact on race relations. You know why? It is jobs. What people want now, they want jobs. They want great jobs with good pay. And when they have that, you watch how race relations will be. And I’ll tell you, we’re spending a lot of money on the inner cities – we are fixing the inner cities – we are doing far more than anybody has done with respect to the inner cities. It is a priority for me, and it’s very important. REPORTER: Mr. President, are you putting what you’re calling the alt-left and white supremacists on the same moral plane? TRUMP: I am not putting anybody on a moral plane, what I’m saying is this: you had a group on one side and a group on the other, and they came at each other with clubs and it was vicious and horrible and it was a horrible thing to watch, but there is another side. There was a group on this side, you can call them the left. You’ve just called them the left, that came violently attacking the other group. So you can say what you want, but that's the way it is. REPORTER: You said there was hatred and violence on both sides? TRUMP: I do think there is blame – yes, I think there is blame on both sides. You look at, you look at both sides. I think there’s blame on both sides, and I have no doubt about it, and you don't have any doubt about it either. And, and, and, and if you reported it accurately, you would say. REPORTER: The neo-Nazis started this thing. They showed up in Charlottesville. TRUMP: Excuse me, they didn't put themselves down as neo-Nazis, and you had some very bad people in that group. But you also had people that were very fine people on both sides. You had people in that group – excuse me, excuse me. I saw the same pictures as you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down, of to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name. REPORTER: George Washington and Robert E. Lee are not the same. TRUMP: Oh no, George Washington was a slave owner. Was George Washington a slave owner? So will George Washington now lose his status? Are we going to take down – excuse me. Are we going to take down, are we going to take down statues to George Washington? How about Thomas Jefferson? What do you think of Thomas Jefferson? You like him? Okay, good. Are we going to take down his statue? He was a major slave owner. Are we going to take down his statue? You know what? It’s fine, you’re changing history, you’re changing culture, and you had people – and I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally – but you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists, okay? And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly. Now, in the other group also, you had some fine people, but you also had troublemakers and you see them come with the black outfits and with the helmets and with the baseball bats – you had a lot of bad people in the other group too. REPORTER: I just didn’t understand what you were saying. You were saying the press has treated white nationalists unfairly? TRUMP: No, no. There were people in that rally, and I looked the night before. If you look, they were people protesting very quietly, the taking down the statue of Robert E. Lee. I’m sure in that group there were some bad ones. The following day, it looked like they had some rough, bad people, neo-Nazis, white nationalists, whatever you want to call ‘em. But you had a lot of people in that group that were there to innocently protest and very legally protest, because you know, I don't know if you know, but they had a permit. The other group didn't have a permit. So I only tell you this: there are two sides to a story. I thought what took place was a horrible moment for our country, a horrible moment. But there are two sides to the country. Does anybody have a final – does anybody have a final question? You have an infrastructure question. REPORTER: What makes you think you can get an infrastructure bill? TRUMP: Well, let me tell you. We came very close with health care. Unfortunately, John McCain decided to vote against it at the last minute. You’ll have to ask him why he did that. We came very close to health care. We will end up getting health care. But we’ll get the infrastructure, and actually, infrastructure’s something I think we'll have bipartisan support on. I actually think – I actually think Democrats will go along with the infrastructure. REPORTER: Mr. President, have you spoken to the family of the victim of the car attack? TRUMP: No. I will be reaching out, I’ll be reaching out. REPORTER: When will you be reaching out? TRUMP: I thought that the statement put out, the mother's statement I thought was a beautiful statement. I’ll tell you – it was something that I really appreciated. I thought it was terrific. And really under the kind of stress that she’s under and the heartache she’s under, I thought putting out that statement to me was really something I won't forget. Thank you all very much. Thank you. REPORTER: Do you plan to go to Charlottesville, Mr. President? TRUMP: Did you know I own a house? It’s in Charlottesville, oh boy. It’s in Charlottesville, you’ll see. REPORTER: Is that the winery or something? TRUMP: It’s a, it’s a, it is the winery. TRUMP: I mean, I know a lot about Charlottesville. Charlottesville is a great place that's been very badly hurt over the last couple of days. I own – I own actually one of the largest wineries in the United States. It’s in charlottesville. REPORTER: What do you think needs to overcome the racial divides? TRUMP: Well, I really think jobs are going to have a big impact. If we continue to create jobs – over a million – substantially more than a million, and you see just the other day, the car companies come in with Foxconn, I think if we continue to create jobs at levels that I'm creating jobs, I think that's going to have a tremendous impact – positive impact – on race relations. REPORTER: And what you said today, how do you think that will impact? TRUMP: Because the people are going to be working and making a lot of money, much more than they ever thought possible. That's going to happen. And the other thing, very important, I believe wages will start going up. They haven't gone up for a long time. I believe wages now, because the economy is doing so well, with respect to employment and unemployment, I believe wages will start to go up. I think that’ll have a tremendously positive impact on race relations. Thank you. Missing out on the latest scoops?

I had to be carried up the stairs and put into a wheelchair for the rest of my stay.Anna Pesce suffered from back pain and hunchback posture (left) until yoga back-care specialist Rachel Jesien began treating her (right) in late 2014.Kevin Kelley Photography: www.kphotok.com (inset); Stephen YangFor the past few decades, Pesce suffered from hunchbacklike posture the result of a herniated disc, scoliosis and osteoporosis, which weakens the bones and can lead to curvature of the spine.I tried everything: acupuncture, a physical therapist and seeing a chiropractor, Pesce adds. You feel good temporarily, but [Id be] in pain again soon after.Three months after her South Carolina visit, she began working with certified yoga instructor Rachel Jesien, 28, who also suffers from scoliosis a curvature in the spine that usually develops during puberty and specializes in back care. Pesces granddaughter, also a yoga teacher, introduced the two.Jesien visited Pesce in her home once a week, teaching her restorative poses and stretches such as childs pose and chair savasana, in which Pesce would rest her lower legs on a chair while lying on the floor with her knees slightly bent and a strap around her thighs. After one month of sessions, Pesce was able to walk again.Anna Pesce (left) uses props such as bolsters and slings to practice yoga with Rachel Jesien.Stephen YangAfter two months, another big milestone was that [Pesce] knew what poses to do whenever the usual pains would come up for her, Jesien says. For example, if she was having hip pain, shed sit on a chair and do an ankle-to-knee pose.By her fourth month, Pesce could do a modified headstand, with her back against the wall and her feet parallel to her head in an inverted V-shape.[Pesce] was timid at first, because just moving caused her so much pain, says Jesien, who received her yoga and back-care certification from the Yoga Union center in Chelsea in 2011. Luckily, the 86-year-old was a quick learner, and they still continue to do weekly sessions after nearly two years.Jesien says that yoga, done with the guidance of a back-care specialist, can strengthen bone density and muscles and alleviate back pain caused by osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and other conditions that affect the elderly.She discovered back-care yoga in 2010 upon the recommendation of a massage therapist. I had to wear a back brace for five years and went to physical therapy every week, but this was the only thing that worked, says Jesien.Dr. Houman Danesh, director of integrative pain management at Mount Sinai Hospital, agrees that doing yoga poses can help some people manage painful back conditions.Doing weight-bearing exercises like squats and lunges can definitely increase bone density, says Danesh. Yoga poses can be easily extrapolated to have the same effect. Physical therapists have been incorporating yoga stretches into their sessions as well.I feel wonderful now because I can drive by myself and do the things I wasnt able to do before, Pesce says.Stephen YangWhile Danesh recommends that people go to a physical therapist first for a proper diagnosis, he stresses that one-on-one care with a specialist is key.I would rather patients see a great physical therapist over a great yoga instructor, Danesh says. But whats important is that people get individual care and attention.While older people may feel intimidated by yoga, Jesien says its worth seeking out a certified back-care instructor, and Pesce agrees.I feel wonderful now because I can drive by myself and do the things I wasnt able to do before, Pesce says. I would recommend this to other people.Pesces daughter, Rosemary Pitruzzella, says shes definitely seen a change in her moms demeanor.My mom is a lot more independent, and even how she carries herself she just seems a lot happier and brighter now, says Pitruzzella, 57.Every day, Pesce practices a series of poses, from pranayama breathing exercises to a supported downward dog achieved with the help of a sling.Shes a tough cookie, Jesien says. Before we were working together, [Pesce] was so down about her condition, but now she has such a different outlook and feels so much better about her life.Stephen YangStephen YangStephen YangStephen YangStephen YangStephen YangStephen YangAdUp NextThe saddest moment for Missy Franklin in mysterious fall Missy Franklin was a swimming star at the 2012 Olympics.... 7View SlideshowBackContinueShare this:FacebookTwitterGoogleFacebook MessengerWhatsAppEmailCopy Advertisement August 8, 2016 Share this:FacebookTwitterGoogleFacebook MessengerWhatsAppEmailCopy",2016/08/09,snopes,1

When I hear such sorrowful pleas, I want to cry from remorse, but I’m afraid the ensuing suds would cake the lenses of my glasses.Yes, the story of this infamous satirist/Jewish grandmother pulling a tray of burnt “Jew cookies” out of an oven has been making its way around the Internet–stirring up all sorts of bizarre accusations towards her and completely ignoring the very particular context in which the image was created. So, for all of you coming to this website who haven’t yet seen the issue–or are unfamiliar with what we do in our magazine–allow me to explain.Heeb is a satirical Jewish culture magazine that interrogates stereotypes and ideas (hopefully in creative ways) that many hold sacred in order to represent the complex and nuanced perspectives that many Jews have about their identities. When we depicted Sarah Silverman behind a hole in a sheet or Jonah Hill dressed as Moses holding two kegs as if they were tablets, we weren’t trying to be shocking–we were trying to communicate something truthful about contemporary Jewishness. Yes, that may sound impossibly high-fallutin, but it’s the truth and while we kind of don’t give a shit whether the magazine wreaks havoc on smug and sanctimonious visions of Jewish life, we do care when our intentions (or those of our collaborators) are distorted.Virtually every pitch we received leading up to the publishing of our Germany Issue circled back to the Nazis and the Holocaust and almost all of them were humorous in nature. Naturally, our editors couldn’t help but wonder whether something new was happening in the culture— whether the taboo against joking about the Holocaust and the Nazis exerted as much power as it used to. Certainly Jews have been joking about the Holocaust since the Holocaust (I believe it was the Warsaw Ghetto where the Jewish inhabitants referred to Hitler regularly as “Horowitz”), but these jokes have largely been uttered in private or underground. In recent years, they have been ï¬nding themselves in the most public of conversations.Seinfeld‘s “Soup Nazi” is as much a part of American culture (and Jewish culture, speciï¬cally) as Fiddler on the Roof, and Curb Your Enthusiasm‘s “Survivor” episode is about as controversial as a Christmas Day screening of Annie Hall. And the trend seems to only gather momentum.Just this month, BrÃ¼no (at one point, America’s number one box office draw) introduced the concept of “bleaching one’s Auschwitz” and the climax of theThe Hangover (which has now grossed over $247 million) revolved around a stripper (played by Heather Graham) returning the ring of the grandmother of one of the leads (played by Ed Helms). “I didn’t know that they gave out rings in the Holocaust,” jokes the character played by Zach Galifianakis .And what better way to capture this moment in popular culture than by having the original “domestic goddess” don the Fuhrer’s famous mustache? For better or worse, hasn’t the Holocaust itself been domesticated?What do you think?",2009/07/30,snopes,3

With cow bells jangling and Masai women thumping up and down, doing a dance they usually do in drought times to praise God, the festivities were an unusual way to mark the fifth anniversary of the attacks. But then again, it was an unusual demonstration of sympathy in the first place. It all began when Kimeli Naiyomah, a star pupil from Enoosaen studying at Stanford University, returned to his village in spring 2002 and told people about Sept. 11. News travels slowly over the bumpy roads of rural Kenya. Even months later, many Masai, who are among Kenya’s most traditional people, had not understood the attack’s magnitude.

The elders settled on 14 head of cattle, which, with a total value of around $3,000, is a huge sum in a village of thatched huts. American diplomats flirted with the idea of shipping the animals to the Central Park Zoo. That proved too complicated. Then someone suggested selling them and using the proceeds to buy Masai jewelry for New Yorkers. But that seemed a little heartless. The indecision went on and on, and by Year 3, some of the Masai were feeling spurned. The cattle were growing fat — and going nowhere. In Masai culture, it is disrespectful to dillydally over such a gift. American diplomats eventually decided that the education plan made the most sense. On Sunday, Ambassador Ranneberger, with his 15-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, toured two of Enoosaen’s high schools — low-slung buildings with tin roofs — before checking out the cattle. There are 21 of them now, and they mooed when they saw the ambassador. “How many cows do you think my daughter would fetch?” he asked Mr. ole Yiamboi as he inspected the animals. “All of them, Daddy!” Elizabeth cut in. Mr. ole Yiamboi laughed — and then cast a quick glance at the ambassador’s daughter. “Six or eight cows would do,” he said.

The remembrance poppy is an artificial flower that has been used since 1921 to commemorate military personnel who have died in war, and represents a common or field poppy, Papaver rhoeas. Inspired by the World War I poem ""In Flanders Fields"", and promoted by Moina Michael, they were first adopted by the American Legion to commemorate American soldiers killed in that war (1914–1918). They were then adopted by military veterans' groups in parts of the British Empire. Today, they are mostly used in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, to commemorate their servicemen and women killed in all conflicts. There, small artificial poppies are often worn on clothing leading up to Remembrance Day/Armistice Day, and poppy wreaths are often laid at war memorials. In Australia and New Zealand, they are also worn on Anzac Day. The Royal British Legion's Poppy Appeal has caused some controversy, with some—including British Army veterans—arguing that it has become excessive, is being used to marshal support behind British military campaigns, and that public figures are pressured to wear poppies. Moina Michael on a 1948 U.S. The remembrance poppy was inspired by the World War I poem ""In Flanders Fields"". Its opening lines refer to the many poppies that were the first flowers to grow in the churned-up earth of soldiers' graves in Flanders, a region of Belgium. It is written from the point of view of the dead soldiers and, in the last verse, they call on the living to continue the conflict. The poem was written by Canadian physician, Lieutenant Colonel John McCrae, on 3 May 1915 after witnessing the death of his friend, a fellow soldier, the day before. The poem was first published on 8 December 1915 in the London-based magazine Punch. In 1918, Moina Michael, who had taken leave from her professorship at the University of Georgia to be a volunteer worker for the American YMCA, was inspired by the poem and published a poem of her own called ""We Shall Keep the Faith"". In tribute to McCrae's poem, she vowed to always wear a red poppy as a symbol of remembrance for those who fought and helped in the war. At a November 1918 YMCA Overseas War Secretaries' conference, she appeared with a silk poppy pinned to her coat and distributed 25 more to those attending. She then campaigned to have the poppy adopted as a national symbol of remembrance. At a conference in 1920, the National American Legion adopted it as their official symbol of remembrance. At this conference, Frenchwoman Anna E. Guérin was inspired to introduce the artificial poppies commonly used today. In 1921 she sent her poppy sellers to London, where the symbol was adopted by Field Marshal Douglas Haig, a founder of the Royal British Legion. It was also adopted by veterans' groups in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. James Fox notes that all of the countries who adopted the remembrance poppy were the ""victors"" of World War I. Today, remembrance poppies are mostly used in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand—countries which were formerly part of the British Empire—to commemorate their servicemen and women killed in all conflicts. They are used to a lesser extent in the United States. In Canada, the poppy is the official symbol of remembrance worn during the two weeks before 11 November, having been adopted in 1921. The Royal Canadian Legion, which has trademarked the image, suggests that poppies be worn on the left lapel, or as near the heart as possible. Until 1996, poppies were made by disabled veterans in Canada, but they have since been made by a private contractor. The Canadian poppies consist of two pieces of moulded plastic covered with flocking with a pin to fasten them to clothing. At first the poppies were made with a black centre. From 1980 to 2002, the centres were changed to green. Current designs are black only; this change caused confusion and controversy to those unfamiliar with the original design. In 2007, sticker versions of the poppy were made for children, the elderly, and healthcare and food industry workers. Canada also issues a cast metal ""Canada Remembers"" pin featuring a gold maple leaf and two poppies, one representing the fallen and the other representing those who remained on the home front. Following the installation of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the National War Memorial in Ottawa in 2000, where the national Remembrance service is held, a new tradition formed spontaneously as attendees laid their poppies on the tomb at the end of the service. This tradition, while not part of the official program, has become widely practised elsewhere in the country, with others leaving cut flowers, photographs, or letters to the deceased. Since joining Canada in 1949, the remembrance poppy and Armistice Day commemorations have largely displaced Newfoundland's own commemorative floral emblem, the forget-me-not, and its own Memorial Day held on 1 July. Although in recent years the forget-me-not has had somewhat of a resurgence in Newfoundland's military commemorations, the remembrance poppy is more common. In Australia, remembrance poppies have been used since 1921 to commemorate Australian soldiers who died in war. On Remembrance Day (11 November) and Anzac Day (25 April) they are laid at war memorials, and are sold by the Returned and Services League of Australia (RSL) in return for donations. In New Zealand, remembrance poppies are most often worn on Anzac Day (25 April) to commemorate New Zealand soldiers who died in war. They are also worn on Remembrance Day, and are sold by the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services' Association (RSA) in return for donations. The RSA planned to hold its first Poppy Day appeal around the time of Armistice Day 1921, as other countries were doing. However, the ship carrying the poppies from France arrived in New Zealand too late, and so the association waited until Anzac Day 1922. This first Poppy Day appeal was a success. Most of the money raised went to needy soldiers and their families, while the rest went to the French Children's League to help relieve suffering in war-ravaged areas of northern France. The popularity of Poppy Day grew and there were record collections during the Second World War. By 1945, 750,000 poppies were being distributed nationwide, which equated to half the population. In the United Kingdom, remembrance poppies are sold by The Royal British Legion (RBL). This is a charity providing financial, social, political and emotional support to those who have served or who are currently serving in the British Armed Forces, and their dependants. They are sold on the streets by volunteers in the weeks before Remembrance Day. The remembrance poppy is the trademark of The Royal British Legion. The RBL state, ""The red poppy is our registered mark and its only lawful use is to raise funds for the Poppy Appeal""; its yearly fundraising drive in the weeks before Remembrance Day. The RBL says these poppies are ""worn to commemorate the sacrifices of our Armed Forces and to show support to those still serving today"". Other poppy merchandise is sold throughout the year as part of the ongoing fundraising. In England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the poppies typically have two red paper petals mounted on a green plastic stem with a single green paper leaf and a prominent black plastic central boss. The stem has an additional branch used to anchor the poppy via a pin in the lapel or buttonhole. In Scotland, the poppies are curled and have four petals with no leaf. The yearly selling of poppies is a major source of income for the RBL in the UK. The poppy has no fixed price; it is sold for a donation or the price may be suggested by the seller. The black plastic center of the poppy was marked ""Haig Fund"" until 1994 but is now marked ""Poppy Appeal"". A team of about 50 people—most of them disabled former British military personnel—work all year round to make millions of poppies at the Poppy Factory in Richmond. Scottish poppies are made in the Lady Haig's Poppy Factory in Edinburgh. For many years after World War I, poppies were worn only on Remembrance Day itself. However, today the RBL's ""Poppy Appeal"" has a higher profile than any other charity appeal in the UK. The poppies are widespread from late October until mid-November every year and are worn by the general public, politicians, the Royal Family and other public figures. It has become common to see large poppies on buses, tube trains and aeroplanes as well as on lampposts, billboards, public buildings and landmarks. Many newspapers and magazines show a poppy on their cover page, and some social network users add poppies to their avatars. Each year, an official Poppy Appeal single has been released. Celebrities have begun wearing expensive crystal-clad poppy brooches, or 'bling poppies', which are sold by the RBL. There are thousands of poppy sellers on the streets and numerous fundraising events; such as concerts, fairs, marathons and competitions. There are also many other events to raise awareness. For example, in 2011, a Second World War plane dropped 6,000 poppies over the town of Yeovil in Somerset. In 2014, the dry moat of the Tower of London was covered with 888,246 ceramic poppies – one for each soldier of the British Empire killed in World War I. In recent years, there has been growing controversy over the Poppy Appeal. Some—including British Army veterans—have argued that the Poppy Appeal has become excessive and garish, that it is being used to marshal support behind British military campaigns, and that poppy wearing has become compulsory for public figures.Channel 4 newsreader Jon Snow described it as ""poppy fascism"". Columnist Dan O'Neill wrote that ""presenters and politicians seem to compete in a race to be first – poppies start sprouting in mid-October while the absence of a poppy is interpreted as absence of concern for the war dead, almost as an unpatriotic act of treachery"". Likewise, Jonathan Bartley of the religious think-tank Ekklesia said ""public figures in Britain are urged, indeed in many cases, required, to wear ... the red poppy, almost as an article of faith. There is a political correctness about the red poppy"". Journalist Robert Fisk complained that the poppy has become a seasonal ""fashion accessory"" and that people were ""ostentatiously wearing a poppy for social or work-related reasons, to look patriotic when it suited them"".Some far-right groups have used the poppy as a symbol of militant British nationalism, while some Muslims have begun to reject it as a symbol of Western imperialism. In 1997 and again in 2000 the Royal British Legion registered the Poppy under Intellectual Property Rights (1997 Case EU000557058) and Trade Mark (2000 Trade Mark 2239583). The Royal British Legion also holds a yearly poppy appeal in Northern Ireland and in 2009 raised more than £1m. However, the wearing of poppies in Northern Ireland is controversial. It is seen by many as a political symbol and a symbol of Britishness, representing support for the British Army. The poppy has long been the preserve of the unionist/loyalist community. Loyalist paramilitaries (such as the UVF and UDA) have also used poppies to commemorate their own members who were killed in The Troubles. Most Irish nationalists/republicans, and Irish Catholics, choose not to wear poppies; they regard the Poppy Appeal as supporting soldiers who killed Irish civilians (for example on Bloody Sunday) and who colluded with illegal loyalist paramilitaries (for example the Glenanne gang) during The Troubles. Irish nationalist groups, and victims' groups, have urged the BBC to end its policy that all presenters must wear poppies. They argue that it breaches impartiality and point out that political symbols are banned in workplaces in Northern Ireland. They also say that the BBC, as a publicly funded body, should broadly reflect the whole community. Likewise, the director of Relatives for Justice has condemned the wearing of poppies by police officers in Catholic neighbourhoods, calling it ""repugnant and offensive to the vast majority of people within our community, given the role of the British Army"". In the Irish Independent, it was claimed that ""substantial amounts"" of money raised from selling poppies are used ""to build monuments to insane or inane generals or build old boys' clubs for the war elite"". However, on Remembrance Day 2010 the SDLP’s Margaret Ritchie was the first leader of a nationalist party to wear one. During World War I, all of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom and about 200,000 Irishmen fought in the British Army (see Ireland and World War I). Although the British Army is banned from actively recruiting in the Republic of Ireland, a small number of its citizens still enlist. The RBL thus has a branch in the Republic and holds a yearly Poppy Appeal there. The RBL also holds a wreath-laying ceremony at St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, which the President of Ireland has attended. The Republic has its own National Day of Commemoration in July for all Irish people who died in war. However, as in other non-Commonwealth countries, poppies are not often worn and are not part of the main commemorations. This is partly due to the British Army's role in fighting against Irish independence, its activities during the War of Independence (for example the Burning of Cork) and the British Army's role in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. In the years following the War of Independence, the poppy was particularly controversial, with nationalists seeing it as a provocative symbol of British imperialism. In Dublin, British Legion marchers often had poppies snatched from their lapels, which led to street fights. In response, some poppy-wearers hid razor blades in their poppies. ""As the 1930s progressed, 'Poppy Day' lost much of its violent edge in Dublin, but the wearing of the symbol also became less commonplace in subsequent decades"". In 2017, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar wore a ""shamrock poppy"" in the Dáil, the first leader of Fine Gael to do so. In the United States, the Veterans of Foreign Wars conducted the first nationwide distribution of remembrance poppies before Memorial Day in 1922. Today, the American Legion Auxiliary distributes crepe-paper poppies in exchange for donations around Memorial Day and Veterans Day. In Hong Kong—which was formerly part of the British Empire—the poppy is worn by some participants on Remembrance Sunday each year. It is not generally worn by the public, although The Royal British Legion's Hong Kong and China Branch sells poppies to the public in a few places in Hong Kong only. Since 2014, the Ukrainians have worn the poppy as a symbol of the Victory over Nazism and commemoration of the victims of World War II. It has largely replaced the Ribbon of Saint George, which became associated with pro-Russian separatists and Russian military aggression. A poppy logo was designed by Serhiy Mishakin and contains the text: ""1939-1945 Never Again"". In parts of Pakistan, the 'Great War Company' hold a private ceremony each 11 November where red poppies are worn, by descendants of World War I veterans from the old British Indian Army. In Albania, government representatives, including Prime Minister Edi Rama, wore the Remembrance Poppy during the commemoration ceremonies for the 70th Anniversary of the Liberation of Albania. Some people choose to wear white poppies as a pacifist alternative to the red poppy. The white poppy and white poppy wreaths were introduced by Britain's Co-operative Women's Guild in 1933. Today, white poppies are sold by Peace Pledge Union or may be home-made. The white poppy may be worn alone or alongside the red poppy. According to the Peace Pledge Union, it symbolizes remembrance of all casualties of war including civilian casualties, and non-British casualties, to stand for peace, and not to glamorize war. However, some people were very offended with the use of the white poppy, and while it was never meant to be disrespectful, some lost their jobs for wearing them on Remembrance Day. To commemorate animal victims of war, Animal Aid in Britain has issued a purple poppy, which can be worn alongside the traditional red one, as a reminder that both humans and animals have been – and continue to be – victims of war. Recently, the purple poppy was replaced by a purple paw symbol that can be worn all year round. This was because people saw the poppy as implying animals had given their lives as heroes in the service of human beings. Animal Aid regards animals of having their lives taken by the abuse of humans in war, not given by the animals as could be the case with people who have the capacity to decide for themselves. On 11 April 2017 a UK based animal charity Sasha Animal Foundation announced that it was to introduce its own Purple Poppy with a different design, stating: ""We will be adhering to the stance that animals are victims of war and not heroes."" In 1993, The Royal British Legion complained that Cannon Fodder, a video game with an anti-war message, had planned to use a poppy on its cover. The Legion, along with some politicians, called it ""offensive to millions"" and ""monstrous"". The publisher was forced to change the cover before the game was released. In 2010 a group of British Army veterans issued an open letter complaining that the Poppy Appeal had become excessive and garish, that it was being used to marshal support behind British military campaigns, and that people were being pressured into wearing poppies. In 2014, the group protested by holding an alternative remembrance service: they walked to The Cenotaph under the banner ""Never Again"" with a wreath of white poppies to acknowledge civilians killed in war. Their tops bore the message ""War is Organised Murder"", a quote from Harry Patch, the last survivor of World War I. A 2010 Remembrance Day ceremony in London was disrupted by members of the radical Islamist Muslims Against Crusades group, who were protesting against British Army actions in Afghanistan and Iraq. They burnt large poppies and chanted ""British soldiers burn in hell"" during the two-minute silence. Two of the men were arrested and charged for threatening behaviour. One was convicted and fined £50. The same group planned to hold another protest in 2011, but was banned by the Home Secretary the day before the planned protest. In 2014, a campaign was begun to encourage Muslim women to wear poppy hijabs. Some criticized it as a ""shrouded loyalty test"" which implied that Muslims needed to prove their loyalty to Britain. In recent years, other people have been arrested in the UK for burning remembrance poppies. In November 2011 a number of people were arrested in Northern Ireland after a picture of two youths burning a poppy was posted on Facebook. The picture was reported to police by a member of the RBL. The following year, a young Canterbury man was arrested for allegedly posting a picture of a burning poppy on Facebook, on suspicion of an offence under the Malicious Communications Act. British Prime Minister David Cameron rejected a request from Chinese officials to remove his poppy during his visit to Beijing on Remembrance Day 2010. The poppy was deemed offensive because it was mistakenly assumed to be connected with the Anglo-Chinese Opium Wars of the 19th century, after which the Qing Dynasty was forced to tolerate the British opium trade in China and to cede Hong Kong to the UK. However, Cameron wore a poppy in 2015 when he met Chinese President Xi Jinping in London. In 2011 it was revealed that Kleshna, one of two businesses selling its own poppies on the RBL website, gives only 10% of its sales to charity. Kleshna sells crystal-clad poppy jewellery which has been worn by celebrities on television. In 2012 there was controversy when The Northern Whig public house in Belfast refused entry to a man wearing a remembrance poppy. Although the owners apologised, the customer took the matter to court, supported by the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland (ECNI). The case was significant for the decision supporting the view of the ECNI that ""The poppy, although not directly linked to a specific religious belief or political opinion, would historically have been associated to a greater extent with the Protestant or unionist community in Northern Ireland"". In the British media, public figures have been attacked for not wearing poppies. British journalist and newsreader Charlene White has faced racist and sexist abuse for not wearing a poppy on-screen. She explained ""I prefer to be neutral and impartial on screen so that one of those charities doesn't feel less favoured than another"". Newsreader Jon Snow does not wear a poppy on-screen for similar reasons. He too was criticised and he condemned what he saw as ""poppy fascism"". Well-known war-time journalist Robert Fisk published in November 2011 a personal account about the shifting nature of wearing a poppy, titled ""Do those who flaunt the poppy on their lapels know that they mock the war dead?"". While all newsreaders in the UK are expected to wear the remembrance poppy, those on the BBC's international news service are told not to. The BBC say this is because the symbol is not widely recognized overseas. The Royal British Legion condemned this, insisting that the poppy is the ""international symbol of remembrance"". In 1947, Portsmouth F.C. changed their traditional black socks to red socks, the same colour as the remembrance poppy. The idea was first proposed by Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery of Alamein, who had been stationed near Portsmouth during World War II and was often seen at the club's Fratton Park football stadium. Montgomery was also honorary club president of Portsmouth F.C. between 1944 to 1961. The tradition of wearing red socks in the home kit still continues at Portsmouth F.C. to present day, without controversy. Football clubs commonly wear jerseys with a poppy emblazoned on, as Celtic controversially did in 2010. In the run-up to Remembrance Day, however, it has become common for UK football teams to play with artificial poppies sewn to their shirts, at the request of the Royal British Legion. This has occasionally provoked negative reactions. At a Celtic v Aberdeen match in November 2010, a group of extreme Celtic supporters, called the Green Brigade, unfurled a large banner in protest at the team wearing poppies. In a statement, it said: ""Our group and many within the Celtic support do not recognise the British Armed Forces as heroes, nor their role in many conflicts as one worthy of our remembrance"". It gave Operation Banner (Northern Ireland), the Afghanistan War and the Iraq War as examples. Northern Irish-born footballer James McClean, who has played for a number of English teams, has received death threats and abuse since 2012 for refusing to wear a poppy on his shirt during matches. McClean said he does not wear one because the Poppy Appeal supports British soldiers who served in Northern Ireland, and believes it would disrespect those killed in his hometown on Bloody Sunday. In November 2011, it was proposed that the England football team should wear poppies on their shirts in a match against Spain. However, FIFA turned down the proposal, saying it would ""open the door to similar initiatives"" across the world, ""jeopardising the neutrality of football"". FIFA's decision was attacked by Prince William and Prime Minister David Cameron, who said he would back any player who ignored the ban. Members of the English Defence League (EDL) held a protest on the roof of FIFA's headquarters in Zürich. Instead, The Football Association came up with other ways to mark Remembrance Day; for example, the England players would wear poppies before kickoff and black armbands during the match, there would be a minute's silence, a poppy wreath would be set on the pitch during the national anthems, poppies would be sold in the stadium and would be shown on the scoreboards and advertising boards. FIFA subsequently allowed the English, Scottish and Welsh teams to wear poppies on black armbands. During the 2018 FIFA World Cup Qualifiers, the England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland football teams were fined for displaying the poppy during matches. FIFA rules forbid the display of ""political or religious symbols"". The decision was strongly criticised by Prime Minister Theresa May, and the Welsh and English football associations appealed against the fine, with the English Football Association threatening to bring the matter to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

Bleuet de France – the cornflower of France, the French equivalent of the remembrance poppy. Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red – a work of installation art placed in the moat of the Tower of London.

Long known for his youthful looks and acrobatic moves which spanned decades of action movies, Li â also known as Li Lianjie â has in recent years battled hyperthyroidism, a condition thatÂ can cause fatigue and weight loss. The condition has previouslyÂ ignited rumors of Liâs declining health. But Liâs manager refuted the rumors, and offered what he said was a recent photo of the star. And Li himself has weighed in: On Wednesday, a message appeared on his Facebook page thanking people for their concern about his health. âIâm doing great and feeling great!â the message said. I would like to thank all my fans who expressed concerns about my health. I'm doing great and feeling great! The South China Morning Post reported Saturday that Liâs fans were âpraying for his healthâ after the emergence of the photo, which the SCMP said was taken at a temple in Tibet and has been widely shared. Others speculated that the man they believe is Li looked older because of bad lighting or the angle. Is that Jet Li? Is that Jet Li? Liâs manager, Steven Chasman, said it was just a bad photo of someone who is 55 years old. âHe has hyperthyroidism that heâs been dealing with for almost 10 years. Itâs nothing life-threatening and heâs dealing with it,â Chasman told The Washington Post on Monday. âHeâs all well and good,â Chasman added,Â sayingÂ he had just spoken with Liâs assistant. For years Li was one of the most electrifying martial arts actors in the world.Â AÂ national wushu champion,Â he broke out in film after portraying the legendary folk hero Wong Fei-hung in the âOnce Upon a Time in ChinaâÂ series. His fights, though choreographed and sometimes employing wire tricks, evinced a fierce athleticism and fluidity of movement. Diagnosed withÂ an overactive thyroid in 2010, LiÂ said in 2013 that heÂ was uncertain if he could continue working but was determined to, according to the Associated Press. âIâm in pain, but Iâm not suffering. Iâm happy,â he said, adding that he took medication. The SCMP reported heÂ has also spoken aboutÂ leg and spinal problems from decades of stunts and injuries from his films. Last year, the Beijing-born actorÂ said during aÂ dinner for his charity, One Foundation, that his illness kept returning, according to the SCMP. AboutÂ one out of 100Â people in the United States have hyperthyroidism, the agency says. Speculation about Liâs health has bubbled up before. In 2016, heÂ dispelledÂ rumors that his illness was worsening and that he needed a wheelchair,Â telling Singaporean journalists that âeven my friends are concerned and are asking how I am,â according to the Straits Times. âThere is nothing to worry about my health,â he said, joking that, âIâm not sure which wheelchair company is putting out such news to sell more wheelchairs. I am a fan of Jet Li. He is battling a thyroid disorder according to @tmz. I am a fan of Jet Li. He is battling a thyroid disorder according to @tmz. The actor, who has not taken on many roles in the past three years, most recently appeared in a short film withÂ Jack Ma, the founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group. He is also reportedly in talks to appear as the emperor of China in Disneyâs live-action production of âMulan,â which isÂ currently scheduled to arrive in theatersÂ in 2020. âIâm not Wong Fei-hung, Iâm not Huo Yuanjia. Iâm not a hero,â he said,Â naming characters he had played. In aÂ videoÂ posted to Liâs official Instagram in December, the actor wished fans a happy new year. On Monday, Chasman called coverage of the photo âsensationalismâ and shared a picture of Li that he says was takenÂ on May 12 in Chengdu. âIt would be nice if people wouldnât make something out of nothing,â the actorâs manager said.",2018/05/21,snopes,0

California, Washington, Oregon, Indiana and Connecticut have statutes that can be used to temporarily take guns away from people a judge deems a threat to themselves or others. Lawmakers in 18 other states — including Florida — plus the District of Columbia have proposed similar measures. At the federal level, Rep. Salud Carbajal (D-Calif.) and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) introduced legislation last May that would encourage states to adopt the approach. Mental illness, escalating threats, substance abuse and domestic violence are among the circumstances in which a judge can order weapon restrictions under the statutes. “This morning I heard the sheriff [in Parkland] lament the fact that he did not have the tools to remove the firearms from the shooter,” Joshua Horwitz, executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, said Thursday. The nation’s patchwork of federal and state gun laws mainly involves background checks and actions to prevent people who pose a threat from buying firearms. The approach of the red flag laws is to seize guns from people who have them and to restrict their access until they are no longer deemed dangerous. “We think of this as a new frontier,” said Jonas Oransky, deputy legal director of Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group founded in 2014. “We don’t have a perfect system in this country, and we can’t stop every act of gun violence. The laws allow family members or law enforcement officers to ask a judge for a “gun violence restraining order” or an “extreme risk protection order” against someone who behaves the way 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, the alleged Florida gunman, did in recent years. According to news reports, Cruz killed squirrels with a pellet gun, trained his dogs to attack a neighbor’s piglets, posted on Insta­gram about guns and killing animals and eventually threatened at least one teen. He showed signs of depression and had been treated at a mental health clinic. Authorities say Cruz used an AR-15 assault-style rifle to kill 17 people and wound at least 15 others at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Wednesday. Cruz has been charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder. In an Everytown study of mass shootings from 2009 to 2016, 42 percent of the attackers had shown warning signs of violent behavior. In most situations, however, the danger is suicide, not homicide. When Duke University researchers looked at the application of Connecticut’s red flag law between 1999 and 2013, they found that police served 762 so-called “risk warrants” during that period and estimated that a gun suicide was prevented for every 10 to 20 seizures. The police found guns in 99 percent of the cases in which they served the warrants, seizing an average of seven firearms from each person. Twenty-one people went on to commit suicide anyway, six by firearms. Overall, suicides account for about 60 percent of gun deaths in the United States. The National Alliance on Mental Illness has no formal position on red flag laws, according to Ron Honberg, a senior policy adviser for the organization, but hopes to see more states adopt them. “It creates some mechanism to intervene at a particular point in time when a person may be in bad shape,” Honberg said. “Is it going to be 100 percent effective? In the three Western states with such laws, all adopted since 2014, a family member or law enforcement officer must petition a court about someone who appears to be a threat. Relatives often go to the police and ask them to do so, experts said. A judge can quickly order the weapons surrendered if convinced of the threat. Within a few weeks, a full hearing is held on longer-term restrictions, which can last a year. Judges must allow people who want their weapons back to revisit the ruling. In Connecticut, only law enforcement agents can ask for a risk warrant. And in Indiana, law enforcement can confiscate weapons without a judge’s order. The gun owner must ask the court to get the weapons returned. States have long prohibited some convicted felons and people committed involuntarily from having firearms. At least seven states last year passed laws restricting access to guns for people convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes, and three require that offenders turn their guns in. Horwitz and Oransky said the National Rifle Association and other members of the gun lobby have not put up much opposition to the statutes. “We would be happy if they came to the table and were supportive of those laws,” Oransky said.",2018/02/16,snopes,1

Valizadeh has instructed his followers to go to a public location at each meeting area and identify themselves by asking, “Do you know where I can find a pet shop?” From there, group members will be taken to a secret meeting location.Women and the LGBT community have been banned from attending the meetings.Valizadeh argued on his blog last year that rape should be legal on private property.“By attempting to teach men not to rape, what we have actually done is teach women not to care about being raped, not to protect themselves from easily preventable acts, and not to take responsibility for their actions,” he wrote at the time. “I thought about this problem and am sure I have the solution: make rape legal if done on private property.”“I propose that we make the violent taking of a woman not punishable by law when done off public grounds,” Valizadeh said.However, the planned meetings are already receiving opposition in some countries.“Sex without consent is rape. There are no excuses. If someone is drunk or drugged they cannot give consent,” a spokesperson for Police Scotland told The National. “We must do all we can to prevent rape and sexual assaults amongst offering all the necessary support and protection to those who are victims.”Australian Greens Party candidate Jill Thomsen lashed out at Valizadeh’s group on Twitter.“The creeps from @ReturnOfKings are meeting in Sydney,” she wrote . “Their masculinity is so fragile they will use ‘codewords’ to find each other in public.”Don't let Silicon Valley control what you see.

It is intended as a resource to inform and assist clinicians who care for cancer patients. It does not provide formal guidelines or recommendations for making health care decisions.This summary is reviewed regularly and updated as necessary by the PDQ Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies Editorial Board, which is editorially independent of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The summary reflects an independent review of the literature and does not represent a policy statement of NCI or the National Institutes of Health (NIH).OverviewThis cancer information summary provides an overview of the use of laetrile as a treatment for people with cancer . The summary includes a history of laetrile research, a review of laboratory studies , the results of clinical trials , and possible side effects of laetrile use.This summary contains the following key information:Laetrile is another name for the natural product amygdalin , which is a chemical constituent found in the pits of many fruits and in numerous plants.Hydrogen cyanide is thought to be the main anticancer compound formed from laetrile via in situ release.Laetrile was first used as a cancer treatment in Russia in 1845, and in the United States in the 1920s.Laetrile has shown little anticancer activity in animal studies and no anticancer activity in human clinical trials .The side effects associated with laetrile toxicity mirror the symptoms of cyanide poisoning, including liver damage, difficulty walking (caused by damaged nerves ), fever , coma , and death.Laetrile is not approved for use in the United States.Inappropriate advertisement of laetrile as a cancer treatment has resulted in a U.S. Food and Drug Administration investigation that culminated in charges and conviction of one distributor.Many of the medical and scientific terms used in this summary are hypertext linked (at first use in each section) to the NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms , which is oriented toward nonexperts. When a linked term is clicked, a definition will appear in a separate window.Reference citations in some PDQ cancer information summaries may include links to external websites that are operated by individuals or organizations for the purpose of marketing or advocating the use of specific treatments or products. These reference citations are included for informational purposes only. Their inclusion should not be viewed as an endorsement of the content of the websites, or of any treatment or product, by the PDQ Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies Editorial Board or the National Cancer Institute .General InformationThe term laetrile is derived from the terms laevorotatory and mandelonitrile and is used to describe a purified form of the chemical amygdalin , a cyanogenic glucoside (a plant compound that contains sugar and produces hydrogen cyanide ) found in the pits of many fruits and raw nuts and in other plants, such as lima beans, clover, and sorghum.[ 1 - 6 ] In body fluids and at physiological pH , hydrogen cyanide dissolves to form the cyanide anion. The term vitamin B-17 was given to laetrile by E.T. Krebs Jr, but it is not an approved designation by the Committee on Nomenclature of the American Institute of Nutrition Vitamins . In the 1970s, laetrile gained popularity as an anticancer agent . By 1978, more than 70,000 individuals in the United States were reported to have been treated with it.[ 2 , 7 , 8 ] Laetrile has been used for cancer treatment both as a single agent and in combination with a metabolic therapy program that consists of a specialized diet, high-dose vitamin supplements, and pancreatic enzymes .[ 9 , 10 ]In the United States, researchers must file an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to conduct drug research in human subjects. In 1970, an IND application to study laetrile was filed by the McNaughton Foundation (San Ysidro, California). This request was initially approved but later rejected because preclinical evidence in animals showed that laetrile was not likely to be effective as an anticancer agent ,[ 3 , 11 , 12 ] and because there were questions about how the proposed study was to be conducted.[ 13 ] Laetrile supporters viewed this reversal as an attempt by the U.S. government to block access to new and promising cancer therapies , and pressure mounted to make laetrile available to the public. Court cases in Oklahoma, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and California challenged the FDA’s role in determining which drugs should be available to cancer patients. Consequently, laetrile was legalized in more than 20 states during the 1970s. In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court acted to uphold a federal ban on interstate shipment of laetrile.[ 2 , 14 ] As a result, the use of laetrile has greatly diminished, but the compound continues to be manufactured and administered as an anticancer therapy , primarily in Mexico, and in some clinics in the United States.Although the names laetrile, Laetrile, vitamin B-17, and amygdalin are often used interchangeably, they are not the same product. The chemical composition of U.S.-patented Laetrile (mandelonitrile-beta-glucuronide), a semisynthetic derivative of amygdalin, is different from the laetrile/amygdalin produced in Mexico (mandelonitrile beta-D-gentiobioside), which is made from crushed apricot pits.[ 15 , 16 ] Mandelonitrile, which contains a cyanide group, is a structural component of both products.[ 15 ] It has been proposed that released (hydrogen) cyanide is the active cancer -killing ingredient in laetrile, but two other breakdown products of amygdalin—prunasin (which is similar in structure to Laetrile) and benzaldehyde —may also be cancer cell inhibitors .[ 17 - 20 ] The studies discussed in this summary used either Mexican laetrile/amygdalin or the patented form. In most instances, the generic term laetrile will be used in this summary; however, a distinction will be made between the products when necessary.Laetrile can be administered orally as a pill, or it can be given by injection ( intravenous or intramuscular ). It is commonly given intravenously for a period of time followed by oral maintenance therapy . The incidence of cyanide poisoning is much higher when laetrile is taken orally [ 21 - 23 ] because intestinal bacteria and some commonly eaten plants contain enzymes (beta-glucosidases) that activate the release of cyanide after laetrile has been ingested .[ 17 , 22 ] Relatively little breakdown occurs to yield the (hydrogen) cyanide when laetrile is injected.[ 7 , 22 ] Administration schedules and the length of treatment in animal models and humans vary widely.ReferencesHoward-Ruben J, Miller NJ: Unproven methods of cancer management.

Am J Pharm 107 (Oct): 397-450, 1935.HistoryAmygdalin was first isolated in 1830 by two French chemists.[ 1 , 2 ] It was used as an anticancer agent in Russia as early as 1845, and positive results were reported for the first patient treated.[ 3 , 4 ] The first recorded use of amygdalin in the United States as a treatment for cancer occurred in the early 1920s.[ 5 ] At that time, amygdalin was taken in pill form; however, the formulation was judged too toxic , and the work was abandoned. In the 1950s, a purportedly nontoxic intravenous form of amygdalin was patented as Laetrile .[ 1 , 6 , 7 ]Laetrile has been tested on cultured animal cells ( cells grown in specialized containers in the laboratory), in whole animals, in xenograft models ( tumor cells from one species transplanted onto another species), and in humans to determine whether it has specific anticancer properties (an ability to kill cancer cells more readily than normal cells). As noted previously ( General Information ), hydrogen cyanide is believed to be the main cancer-killing ingredient in laetrile.[ 8 , 9 ] When amygdalin interacts with the enzyme beta-glucosidase or undergoes hydrolysis (breakdown in a reaction with water) in the absence of enzymes , hydrogen cyanide, benzaldehyde , and glucose ( sugar ) are produced.[ 1 , 7 , 8 , 10 , 11 ] Hydrogen cyanide can also be produced from prunasin, which is a less-than-complete breakdown product of amygdalin.[ 1 , 8 ]Proponents of laetrile have proposed four different theories to explain its purported anticancer activity. The first of these incorporates elements of the trophoblastic theory of cancer , a theory that is not widely accepted as an explanation for cancer formation. According to the trophoblastic theory, all cancers arise from primordial germ cells ( cells that, under normal circumstances, would give rise to eggs or sperm ), some of which become dispersed throughout the body during embryonic development and, therefore, are not confined to the testes or ovaries . [ 12 - 17 ] The rationale for laetrile use is the suggestion that malignant cells have higher than normal levels of an enzyme called beta-glucuronidase (which is different from the aforementioned enzyme beta-glucosidase) and that they are deficient in another enzyme called rhodanese (thiosulfate sulfurtransferase). Another suggestion is that laetrile is modified in the liver , and that beta-glucuronidase breaks down the modified compound , ultimately producing cyanide. Rhodanese can convert cyanide into the relatively harmless compound thiocyanate. Thus, it has been proposed that cancer cells are more susceptible to the toxic effects of laetrile than normal cells because of an imbalance in these two enzymes .[ 10 , 13 , 18 - 20 ] Some experimental evidence does support the idea that normal tissues and malignant tissues differ substantially in their concentrations of beta-glucuronidase [ 21 ] and rhodanese.[ 22 , 23 ]The second theory states that cancer cells contain more beta-glucosidase activity than normal cells and, as in the first theory, that they are deficient in rhodanese.[ 1 , 5 , 13 , 15 , 18 , 24 , 25 ] Again, elevated beta-glucosidase activity in the interstitial regions of some malignancies has been experimentally demonstrated.[ 26 , 27 ]The third theory states that cancer is the result of a metabolic disorder caused by a vitamin deficiency . It states further that laetrile, or amygdalin/ vitamin B-17, is the missing vitamin needed by the body to restore health.[ 18 , 28 - 30 ] Experimental evidence indicates that the level of intake of individual vitamins and/or the vitamin status of an organism can influence the development of cancer, but there is no evidence that laetrile is needed for normal metabolism or that it can function as a vitamin in animals or humans.[ 31 , 32 ]The fourth theory suggests that the cyanide released by laetrile has a toxic effect beyond its interference with oxygen utilization by cells . According to this theory, cyanide increases the acid content of tumors and leads to the destruction of lysosomes (compartments inside cells that contain enzymes capable of breaking down other cellular molecules ). The injured lysosomes release their contents, thereby killing the cancer cells and arresting tumor growth.[ 15 ] According to this theory, another consequence of lysosome disruption is stimulation of the immune system .ReferencesDorr RT, Paxinos J: The current status of laetrile.

Nutr Today 12 (5): 12-17, 1977.Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical StudiesPreclinical investigations of the potential anticancer activity of laetrile have used numerous cultured cell lines and tumor models , and they explored the following issues:Whether laetrile, given alone or in combination with other substances, exhibits anticancer activity of any kind.The toxic effects associated with laetrile treatment .The location of laetrile breakdown in the body, and how this breakdown occurs.The route(s) of excretion for laetrile and its broken-down products.Animal studies of laetrile have used rodents,[ 1 - 10 ] dogs,[ 11 - 13 ] rabbits,[ 13 ] and a cat.[ 11 ] Early work led to the hypothesis that enzymes were necessary to release hydrogen cyanide from amygdalin . When high levels of these enzymes were present, symptoms of cyanide poisoning were more pronounced.[ 1 , 13 ] In two studies sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and published in 1975, various rodent cancers ( osteogenic sarcoma , melanoma , carcinosarcoma , lung carcinoma , and leukemia ) were transplanted into rats and mice.[ 2 , 3 ] In both studies, the animals were treated with intraperitoneal injections of amygdalin, with or without the enzyme beta-glucosidase. None of the solid tumors or leukemias that were investigated responded to amygdalin at any dose that was tested. No statistically significant increase in animal survival was observed in any of the treatment groups. Similar results were obtained in another study using human breast cancer and colon cancer cells implanted into mice ( xenograft models).[ 10 ] Amygdalin at every dose level tested produced no response either as a single agent or in combination with beta-glucosidase. It was discovered that animals experienced more side effects when beta-glucosidase was given concurrently with amygdalin than when amygdalin was given alone.[ 2 , 3 ]Additional cell culture and animal studies involving more than a dozen other tumor models have been published.[ 1 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 9 , 14 , 15 ] In one study, preliminary findings by one of the principal investigators that amygdalin inhibited the growth of primary tumors and the incidence of lung metastases in mice bearing spontaneous (not treatment -induced) mammary adenocarcinomas could not be confirmed.[ 4 ] However, positive results were obtained in another study.[ 9 ] A summary of study results is provided in Tables 1 and 2 below.",2013/09/27,snopes,0

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson“If I debated him, we would have such high ratings,” the New York developer and reality television star said. “I think I should ... take that money and give it to some worthy charity.”Sanders appeared to agree in a post on Twitter on Thursday.“Game on,” he tweeted. “I look forward to debating Donald Trump in California before the June 7 primary.”Trump and Sanders have gone through a series of debates against rivals within their parties but Republican and Democratic presidential candidates usually do not debate each other until the parties have selected a nominee.Slideshow (2 Images)The hashtag #BernieTrumpDebate began trending in the United States with news of the possible debate.Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in an email to Reuters on Thursday there were no formal plans yet for such an event. Representatives for the Sanders campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Kimmel said he asked Trump about the debate at the suggestion of Sanders, who is scheduled to appear on the show Thursday night.Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist who was elected to Congress as an independent and has made economic equality a keystone of his campaign, had first challenged Clinton to a California debate. He said he was disappointed when the former secretary of state declined. The Clinton campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment to a possible Trump-Sanders debate.Clinton has tried to woo Sanders supporters as she works to secure the party’s nomination for the Nov. 8 election. But some worry his supporters - who are largely young, working-class and disillusioned with party establishment - will turn instead to political neophyte Trump, who has championed a populist agenda.Sanders has said he will do everything he can to ensure that Trump does not win the White House.Reporting by Megan Cassella; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Bill Trott",2016/05/26,snopes,1

Gaps remain in understanding risks associated with antidepressant discontinuation in the context of the drug regimen. We assessed the effects of antidepressant discontinuation on the risk of suicide attempt.METHOD:We report a nested case-control study of suicide attempt with at least 12 months of prior observation. A retrospective cohort of 2.4 million patients with depression (ICD-9 codes 296.2, 296.3, 300.4, and 311), aged 5-89 years, was created using standard Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) criteria; from this cohort, cases (n = 10,456) and controls (n = 41,815) were selected for study. Data were from a large, national, longitudinal, integrated claims database of managed care enrollees in the United States from calendar years 1999 through 2006.RESULTS:Compared to controls, cases were more likely to have used antidepressants, to have had multiple antidepressants, and to have had prior depressive episodes and inpatient stays that involved depression. After adjusting for confounding due to depression severity, comorbidities, and other medications, antidepressant use showed a protective effect for suicide attempt (OR = 0.62, P < .001). Compared to prior therapy, antidepressant discontinuation had a significant risk for suicide attempt (OR = 1.61, P < .05). Antidepressant initiation had the highest risk for suicide attempt (OR = 3.42, P < .05), followed by titration (titration up, OR = 2.62; down, OR = 2.19; P < .05).CONCLUSIONS:Substantial confounding exists in examining the link between antidepressant use and suicide attempt, specifically regarding those factors associated with characteristics of depression. Antidepressant discontinuation showed a significant risk for suicide attempt, as did the period of an abbreviated trial, that is, stopping before a therapeutic regimen of 56 days had been reached. The highest risk was associated with initiation, a finding consistent with other studies, closely followed by periods of dosing changes and discontinuation. Patients should be closely monitored during these periods.©Copyright 2009 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.PMID:",2013/06/15,snopes,0

Horace Greeley:DEAR SIR: I have just read yours of the 19th, addressed to myself through the New-York Tribune. If there be in it any statements or assumptions of fact which I may know to be erroneous, I do not now and here controvert them. If there be in it any inferences which I may believe to be falsely drawn, I do not now and here argue against them.

I would save it the shortest way under the Constitution. The sooner the national authority can be restored the nearer the Union will be ""the Union as it was."" If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the same time save Slavery, I do not agree with them. If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the same time destroy Slavery, I do not agree with them. My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or destroy Slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves, I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that. What I do about Slavery and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save this Union, and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union. I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the cause, and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will help the cause. I shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors; and I shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views.

The bomb killed 70,000-80,000 people and injured another 70,000.But during the daily White House press briefing Monday, Earnest was asked about Abe’s decision to visit Pearl Harbor — which will come shortly after the 75th anniversary of the attack — and how veterans should feel about it, namely because Japan has refused to apologize for the attack.“If I were a World War II veteran who was drafted by the United States military to go and fight for our country overseas in the aftermath of the Pearl Harbor attack, I might feel quite embittered,” Earnest said. “And I think it would be a perfectly natural and understandable human reaction to not be particularly satisfied with the words of the Japanese Prime Minister.”But, Earnest said those people who feel “personal bitterness” should set aside their feelings for the greater good of the U.S.“And so, yes, there may be some who feel personally embittered,” he added. “But I’m confident that many will set aside their own personal bitterness, not because they’re personally satisfied by the words of the Prime Minister, but because they recognize how important this moment is for the United States.”For what it’s worth, Abe said that he would “mourn the souls of the victims” of Japan’s surprise attack with Obama during his visit later this month.",2016/12/06,snopes,1

The episode airs in the US later this week.""I get to play a really mean person,"" teased Kudrow, ""so that's really fun.""During a break from filming the episode last November, the duo - who are pals in real life, as evidenced by their unabashed banter - chatted about working opposite each other again. (Last year, Cox guest starred on Kudrow's wry online improv series Web Therapy as a psychic looking to get her sixth sense back from Kudrow's matter-of-fact therapist.)Kudrow insisted she would have taken just about any role offered on Cougar Town, as long as it didn't require any nudity, something that apparently hasn't been an issue for the 45-year-old star of the show, who has taken it off in the name of laughs on more than one occasion since Cougar Town debuted on ABC last September to over 11 million viewers.""I've turned a corner,"" Cox said jokingly. ""Now that I'm this age, I've decided to go as nude as possible.""""You look great,"" Kudrow extolled.""No, Lisa, I'm lit well,"" Cox retorted.""Well, I could be on the surface of the sun, and it wouldn't look good,"" Kudrow quipped.Cox said there was an open invitation for all her Friends co-stars - Kudrow, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, Matt LeBlanc and Jennifer Aniston - to stop by Cougar Town, but she was most anxious for a visit from Kudrow, a Groundlings improv vet who starred in such films as Romy and Michele's High School Reunion and Wonderland during her Friends tenure.""I really wanted Lisa to be on the show, if she would,"" said Cox.""First of all, she's so unbelievably talented. I knew she'd go out there and play a really fun character, so it just kind of worked out perfectly for her to play a dermatologist that is very judgemental and not nice. She takes those risks. ... It was great.""After Friends ended in 2004, both actresses returned to TV in leading roles on their own series.The 46-year-old Kudrow starred for one season as faded sitcom star Valerine Cherish on the HBO faux-reality series The Comeback, while Cox spent two seasons as cut-throat editor Lucy Spiller on the FX tabloid drama Dirt.Friends fans should not anticipate a full-blown reunion of the Central Perk denizens - either on Cougar Town or the big screen.Kudrow and Cox insisted Friends co-creators David Crane and Marta Kauffman have never pitched the pair an idea for Friends: The Movie despite the success of Sex and the City at strutting from cable channel HBO into multiplexes in 2008.""Sex and the City was already filmic,"" said Kudrow. ""It was a single-camera show that was like a half-hour movie every week, anyway. Our show was multi-camera in front of an audience.

Federal agents found they were unable to prosecute him, since eating at a Christian-owned restaurant wasn’t “technically” defined as a hate crime under United States law.“It’s 2018. It’s time to put intolerance behind us by making any association with Christians in the public sphere simply intolerable,” Pelosi concluded.Get the Bee delivered straight to your inbox:",2018/06/12,snopes,1

Trump had been ordered to leave Bavaria for failing to complete mandatory military service and to register his initial emigration to the United States twenty years earlier. Prince Luitpold rejected Trump’s request for repatriation; the family later settled in New York. Translated from the German by Austen Hinkley.Most Serene, Most Powerful Prince Regent! Most Gracious Regent and Lord!I was born in Kallstadt on March 14, 1869. My parents were honest, plain, pious vineyard workers. They strictly held me to everything good — to diligence and piety, to regular attendance in school and church, to absolute obedience toward the high authority.After my confirmation, in 1882, I apprenticed to become a barber. I emigrated in 1885, in my sixteenth year. In America I carried on my business with diligence, discretion, and prudence. God’s blessing was with me, and I became rich. I obtained American citizenship in 1892. In 1902 I met my current wife. Sadly, she could not tolerate the climate in New York, and I went with my dear family back to Kallstadt.The town was glad to have received a capable and productive citizen. My old mother was happy to see her son, her dear daughter-in-law, and her granddaughter around her; she knows now that I will take care of her in her old age.But we were confronted all at once, as if by a lightning strike from fair skies, with the news that the High Royal State Ministry had decided that we must leave our residence in the Kingdom of Bavaria. We were paralyzed with fright; our happy family life was tarnished. My wife has been overcome by anxiety, and my lovely child has become sick.Why should we be deported? This is very, very hard for a family. What will our fellow citizens think if honest subjects are faced with such a decree — not to mention the great material losses it would incur. I would like to become a Bavarian citizen again.In this urgent situation I have no other recourse than to turn to our adored, noble, wise, and just sovereign lord, our exalted ruler His Royal Highness, highest of all, who has already dried so many tears, who has ruled so beneficially and justly and wisely and softly and is warmly and deeply loved, with the most humble request that the highest of all will himself in mercy deign to allow the applicant to stay in the most gracious Kingdom of Bavaria.Your most humble and obedient,Friedrich Trump",2017/02/18,snopes,1

So how come he left the rave reviews till last?Bryan AppleyardJust over 20 years ago, in his mid-forties, Patrick Stewart was doing pretty well as an actor. He didn’t have any savings, but he had a nice house in Chiswick and could afford to send his two children to private schools. “My career,” he says, “had been chugging along in an okay way.” Then he appeared in Peter Shaffer’s Yonadab at the National Theatre. It was Shaffer’s only flop, and Stewart found himself playing to an almost empty house. Next came Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? with Billie Whitelaw at the Young Vic. It was a hit and ready to transfer to the West End, but Whitelaw didn’t want to go. The money man said the loss of Whitelaw was a problem. He couldn’t take it into the West End without a star people had heard of. “It really hurt, that remark. All those years of work at the RSC. But I guess it was a pragmatic point of view. I wasn’t bankable, and he couldn’t sell this production on my name.”So, in 1987, he took a television job in Hollywood. Everybody told him to do it – he could make some money, be seen by millions and then come home. It was no big commitment, he was assured, as the series would certainly bomb. “It sounded like a great plan. It was a great deal. That’s why I did it.” The series was certain to fail because it seemed like little more than a desperate attempt to revive an old one. Furthermore, Stewart was to be cast as the most unAmerican hero imaginable, an earl-grey drinking, vaguely aristocratic, vaguely naval type with a French – French! – name, who preferred talking to fighting. On the face of it, the series only made sense as some sort of tax scam. Stewart and the rest of the cast thought nothing of signing up for six years.But, of course, Star Trek: The Next Generation lasted for seven years, and Stewart was Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Starship Enterprise for 178 episodes. Then it turned into a series of films, culminating in Star Trek: Nemesis, in 2002. “It came to a point where I had no idea where Picard began and I ended. We completely overlapped. His voice became my voice, and there were other elements of him that became me.” Stewart was now unbankable in a wholly new way. No director in Hollywood wanted to cast this grand, deep-voiced, bald English guy because everybody knew he was Picard and couldn’t possibly be anybody else. In the event, he effectively reprised the part as Professor Charles Xavier – a grand, deep-voiced, bald English guy – in the X-Men films. “I don’t have a film career,” he says wryly, “I have a franchise career.”In 2004, however, homesick, pining for the stage and with his second marriage coming to an end (he now lives with the actress Lisa Dillon), he came home with, for a Shakespearian star, a gaping hole in his CV. “There comes a point where you have to start ticking off these roles. I’ve missed out on Hamlet and Romeo, probably Richard III, too. I was even uncomfortably aware when I took on Macbeth that people were saying I was a little old for it. I’ve not done Lear, but Ian McKellen has closed that door for a good few years. If I could fit in only one more Shakespeare role, it would be Falstaff. I’ve always thought of him as a middle-aged Hamlet. It’s a great role.” He’s 67 now and so absurdly buff that he could pass for an absurdly buff 50. We meet at the stage door of the Gielgud theatre – or, rather, we fail to meet, because he rushed in with a Huddersfield Town cap pulled over his face. He doesn’t like the hooker-and thug-infested bit of Soho around Rupert Street, and he and the rest of the cast leave by the front entrance in the evening, hence the speed of his entry and the disguise. He’s doing his Macbeth at the Gielgud, and both he and the show are magnificent, mesmerising. The reviews are raves, and it’s just about to go to New York. It was, I say, the play that turned me on to Shakespeare when I was 14. He laughs. “I think you’ll find a lot of people will say that. I got a sniff of it when I was 14. I thought I was going to play it, and somebody said to me, ‘Stewart, you’re going to get a lot of opportunities to play parts like this – we’re giving it to somebody else.’ As it happened, that production didn’t eventually happen.”There seem to be three important things about Stewart’s childhood: his luck, his dad and the Yorkshire countryside. He was lucky because, in spite of abject academic failure – he skived off on the day of his 11-plus – he was spotted by a smart English teacher and was taught outside school by a brilliant drama teacher. It was clear where he was going, and, after a spell on the local paper, he became a full-time actor. “It was a smart move, bunking off the 11-plus. I would never have met Cecil Dormand – a great man – and I would have been a grammar-school failure.”His father had been in the army for 10 years and then enlisted again in 1939. “He was an imposing man, regimental sergeant major in the Parachute Regiment. He had a terrific voice, better than mine. Somebody said when my father walked on the parade ground, the birds stopped singing.” The Macbeth production is set in a modern, military state. Stewart has grown a sergeant-majorish moustache for the part. “When I put my uniform on and look in the mirror, he stares straight back at me.”From the first, he was a workaholic, an affliction that, he admits, made him a bad father, remote like his dad. “I always chose work over the family – I regret that, I really do. I have a great relationship with my children now, terrific, but I didn’t always have it. I missed out so much. And I don’t think I supported their mother as much as I might have done. It would never occur to me to put family first. It’s still a struggle. It wasn’t because I didn’t love them, I just loved the job so much.”He did bits of film and television, but everything else was theatre. He pursued his craft with awesome austerity, a habit that backfired on him when he got on the Star Trek set. At an early shoot, he snapped at the rest of the cast: “We’re not here to have fun, we’re here to work.” He says now: “I came to think there was too much fooling around on set. I was very aware of the clock ticking. I was the oldest person on the set, and we were working until midnight or beyond, and it took more of a toll on me than on them.”The others also concluded he had a poverty mentality, another aspect of his austerity. He was in denial about what he was being paid for playing Picard. For 15 minutes’ overtime, he earned an extra £125, exactly what he had been making in a week at the Young Vic. But he still lived above somebody’s garage.After a year, he did buy a new car: a Honda. The rest of the cast were in Mercedes and Fer-raris. But the point was – and this, I am sure, is why his Star Trek was easily the most successful iteration of the franchise – that he took Picard seriously.“I’m very proud of the series. I think we did really good work. Every now and then we did absolute crap, but it was 178 episodes. We really fought to keep the standards high – the script, the language, the story lines, everything. We also acquired an astonishing number of eminent fans: several secretaries of state, chiefs of staff, chancellors of universities. Frank Sinatra never missed Earth is released on November 16 www.bryanappleyard.com a show, and Tom Hanks knows the name of every episode.”Perhaps the key was that Stewart was such a team player. He speaks warmly of the cast, and they are plainly still friends, especially Jonathan Frakes, who played Riker, Picard’s deputy, and whose shouting of “Red alert!” gave me and my daughter hours of innocent delight. He mentions proudly that Marina Sirtis, the pompous “counsellor” Deanna Troi, had lunch with him in London recently. Best of all, he loves the movie Galaxy Quest, a sublime Star Trek spoof. “Jonathan told me to see it. I said I didn’t want to see the piss taken out of me by Alan Rickman and the rest. He told me to see it in Santa Monica on a Saturday night. I did, and it was perfect, fantastic, one of my all-time favourites. They got it exactly right – that’s how it was, and the ending was right at the heart of the spirit of Star Trek.”He was missing theatre from the beginning. And so, in his room above the garage, he constructed a series of one-man shows that he took to universities and drama schools in California. The best, A Christmas Carol, made it to Broad-way. The first few nights were full of Trekkies, many in uniform.But now, he’s back. His rich voice provides the narration for the movie Earth, made by the BBC Natural History Unit, a feature-length version of Planet Earth. And, best of all, he is immersed, for at least two years, in the theatre and Shakespeare. This makes him very happy. He revels in the ensemble and he wallows in the language. “When Macbeth starts, I have three hours to inhabit this role, this man who’s saying these amazing things. It’s not just a great story, it’s mind-expanding just getting your head round this imagery and this language. It’s like a drug – there’s nothing to match it.”And that third important thing, the countryside? Well, he used to cycle up to the Dales as a boy – “Turning back to go home was a physical pain” – and the landscape infected him for life. In Hollywood, he pined for English hills and valleys. Now he has a house in the south Dales. He reckons he could walk northeastward for three days from there and never see a road. He has also learnt to love southern England. He has just done up a house in Oxfordshire. And he remembers a walk he took over the South Downs. “One evening that I didn’t have a show, I had been rehearsing and I went home. It was midsummer, so it was light, and I started walking. I walked for hours and got to some high point looking down on this valley.” He sighs and his eyes are damp. “And smoke was coming up. I was overwhelmed with feelings I couldn’t articulate. Overwhelmed. It moved me so much.”Great actor, good man. As the Vulcans used to say, live long and prosper, Captain Picard – sorry, Patrick Stewart.I live in Ann Arbor, Michigan and it was a little over a year ago that I saw Patrick Stewart performing here with the Royal Shakespeare Company and I enjoyed the performances immensely. What moved me most I think was the awareness that here's someone who sets the example for one who has found a love in his own work that we should all strive to find in ours.Chris Kaltwasser, Ann Arbor, Michigan USI was a pretty big Star Trek TNG fan when I was a kid.

Wright, Atlanta, Geogia, USAAround the early 80s I bump into Mr. Stewart on a video of Derek Jacobiâs Hamlet in a High School British Literature Class. Needless to say, due to being in high school, I was not that consistently interested in it. I think I sleep through half of it over a four day period of classes. Then as an insatiable curious budding actor studying Shakespeare in an Illinois college library, I came across John Bartonâs Playing Shakespeare Video Series which introduced me again to Mr. Stewart. From then on I was hooked and keep track of what he was doing. And now, in light of where he has taken his career in these last two years, I am inspired. It serves as a model to be constantly evolving and challenging oneself in a life's work. Mr. Stewart...Thank You!George Younts, Charleston, USA/SCI fell in love with Patrick Stewart well before Trek in the sublime camp of the BBC miniseries ""I Claudiu"" as Sejanus. Hot Gladiator! Evil character that gets what he deserves. I can't recomend ""I Claudius"" enough!Andrew Mondt, Chicago, IllinoisJean-Luc Picard is the manager everyone of us would love to work for. I love TNG because of him. But I've really enjoyed seeing him back in Shakespear -- his Prospero was wonderful. Long may he shine as an actor in whatever he wishes to do.Peter, Warwick, WarksI love Patrick Stewart since I first saw him in an episode of Star Trek the Next Generation. I found his character exceptionally intelligent and highly inspirational for anyone leading a group of professionals. But then I learned that he was a classical theatre actor and that he loved to play Shakespeare and Dickens and so on. I had the pleasure to watch him at Washington when he portrayed Othello in a photonegative version and have followed his career in movies and TV programs. I never have enough of him and I am very pleased to know that he is still having new and great accomplishments and success as the great actor he is. God bless him.Ana Leticia Pastrana, Mexico City, MexicoPatrick Stewart is indeed a very fine actor. Being an original trekkie, I must say that Star Trek Next Generation reruns are still a pleasure to watch (I also have been enjoying the recent series Star Trek Enterprise which tells how it all started and is also very well done). Even though we have never met, in my book he is a very intelligent, sexy man with a great sense of humor (yeah Galaxy Quest!).

He served five terms in Congress. He ran a newspaper and helped found a state Republican Party. But first, he had to win his freedom. To do that, he conceived a plan that struck a blow against the Confederacy so significant that he was heralded across the nation. Carrying out his mission required bravery, intelligence and precision timing — attributes that many whites at that time thought blacks didn’t possess. Robert Smalls proved them wrong and changed history in the doing. Smalls was born in Beaufort, S.C., on April 5, 1839, the son of Lydia Polite, a slave who was a housekeeper in the city home of John McKee, owner of the Ashdale Plantation on Lady’s Island, one of the Sea Islands. Though he never knew the identity of his father, it was widely believed that Smalls was the progeny of McKee’s son, Henry. “There was a distinctly fatherly relationship between [Henry McKee] and my great-grandfather,” said Helen Boulware Moore of Lakewood Ranch, Fla., who grew up hearing stories about Smalls from her grandmother, Elizabeth Lydia Smalls Bampfield, his daughter. Growing up at the McKees’ place, Smalls played with both black and white children, ate food cooked in the kitchen where his mother worked and slept in a bed in a small house that was provided for her. Polite had been taken from her family on the island plantation at age 9 to work as a companion to the McKee children in Beaufort. Because of his connection to Henry McKee, Smalls was allowed “to go places and do things others couldn’t do. That could cause problems with blacks . . . and could be a dangerous thing with whites, as well,” said Michael Allen of the National Park Service’s Gullah/Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor, which runs through South Carolina. The town of Beaufort maintained a 7 p.m. daily curfew for blacks, but on many occasions young Smalls ignored the bell and continued to play with white children. Several times, he was taken into custody. Henry McKee paid a fine to retrieve him, Moore said. When he was 10, his mother sent him to the plantation to learn the reality of slave life. He came back defiant, not willing to comply, as she had hoped. “He acted as if he could do what the white children did, and that frightened her,” Moore said. Worried that her son would suffer consequences for his bold behavior, Polite asked McKee to rent out Smalls at age 12 to work in nearby Charleston. Each week, he was given $1 of his wages; the rest went to the McKees. He supplemented his income by purchasing cheap candy and tobacco and reselling them. At age 18, Smalls met Hannah Jones, an enslaved hotel worker who had two daughters. He sought permission to marry and live with her in an apartment in Charleston, Moore said. “He was smart enough to know that at any moment, she and any children they had might be sold, so he asked her enslaver,” who agreed, Moore said. Smalls became skilled at working on ships, eventually advancing to the position of pilot. In 1861, he was hired to work on a steamer called the Planter, which was used to transport cotton to ships headed to Europe. But once the Civil War started, the Confederates seized it for use as an armed transport vessel. Smalls knew how to navigate. He knew that the white crew trusted him. He had his eye on freedom, and all he needed was an opportunity. “They were going to seize the ship,” said Lawrence Guyot, a black-history expert in Washington. “It was dangerous. It was daring. It was unprecedented. And when they accomplished it, it was used to demonstrate that blacks could be brave and strategic in pulling off military maneuvers. Moore, a retired professor, pointed out that “a lot is said about [Smalls’s] patriotism, but it was not simply patriotism that led him to act. Smalls had sought to purchase his wife, his two young children and his wife’s daughters, but the price of $800 was too steep. In the early hours of May 13, 1862, the Planter’s crew took an unapproved furlough into town, leaving Smalls, 23, and several other black crew members aboard. Wearing a captain’s coat and hat and taking care to hide his black face, Smalls steered the ship toward a rendezvous spot to pick up the men’s families. “It was really dangerous because they were flying the Confederate flag,” Moore said. “They made a decision that they wouldn’t be taken alive. . . . Through Charleston Harbor and past several Confederate lookouts, the ship steamed. Smalls signaled at the appropriate points, as he’d seen the captain do. By dawn, the Planter had reached the federal blockade of the harbor. The crew lowered the Confederate flag and hoisted a white sheet that Hannah had brought from the hotel where she worked, Moore said. “One of the most heroic and daring adventures since the war commenced was undertaken and successfully accomplished by a party of negroes in Charleston,” trumpeted the June 14, 1862, edition of Harper’s Weekly. Commodore S.F. DuPont, the commander of the federal fleet barricading Fort Sumter, in Charleston Harbor, wrote to the Department of the Army that Smalls provided information “of the utmost importance” to the Union, such as the location of mines he had helped lay in the harbor while working for the Confederacy, news accounts show. This May marks the 150th anniversary of the seizure of the Planter. A commemoration is scheduled for May 12-13 in Charleston. “Somebody should make a movie about this guy,” said Frank Smith, founding director of the District’s African American Civil War Memorial Museum, which includes an exhibit about Smalls. Smalls became a ship pilot for the Union, serving as a volunteer until he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in Company B of the 33rd Regiment, U.S. Colored Troops. He fought in 17 battles and is credited with recruiting 5,000 blacks. He was later designated a major general in the South Carolina militia. In April 1865, Smalls returned to Beaufort and the McKee house, which he had purchased in a tax sale, using part of a $1,500 appropriation he received for taking the Planter. Back home, he was reunited with his mother — and one of his former owners. “Mrs. McKee, after the war was over, came wandering to the house one day,” Moore said. “Because of her dementia, she didn’t realize the house was no longer hers. . . . Smalls, who had learned to read and write while serving in the military, went into business and then politics. He served in both houses of the South Carolina Legislature and in 1874 was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, beating a white Democrat in a district that was almost 70 percent black. But his later years were plagued by racism as white-supremacist Democrats stepped up efforts to unseat Reconstruction legislators. He was accused of bribery but later cleared, historical accounts show. In his personal life, Smalls lost a son in infancy and Hannah in 1883. Seven years later, at the age of 51, he married Annie Wigg, who bore him a second son, William Robert. Annie died a few years later. Smalls himself died in 1915 at what is now called the the Robert Smalls House, at 511 Prince Street in Beaufort. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is currently for sale for $1.2 million. Other structures and streets have been named for Smalls. The African American Museum in Philadelphia is currently displaying “The Life and Times of Congressman Robert Smalls: A Traveling Exhibition.” The highest honor, though, was the commissioning in 2007 of the Maj. Gen. Robert Smalls, an Army logistics support vessel, in a ceremony at Baltimore’s Inner Harbor attended by several of his descendants. It is the only Army ship named for an African American. Moore said Smalls’s direct descendants number about 75, the youngest of whom is her 3-month-old granddaughter, Maya Helen Jenkins. Moore’s son, Michael, 49, the chairman of Glory Foods, which sells Southern-style dishes, said his great-great-grandfather’s story is an inspiration for his four young sons, as it was for him. As a child, he said, he would search bookstores for books about Smalls. “I didn’t think about Robert Smalls as history,” he said. “I thought of him as family. “The thing that I’m proudest of is his mind-set that he was going to be free, when he had no rational or logical reason to think that he would be. It was all or nothing.",2012/02/23,snopes,1

Marquez ignored them which prompted calls and shouts that he was a racist.Marquez left the establishment after eating, but allegedly sustained a sudden blow to the back of his head outside the McDonald’s, which knocked him unconscious. When he woke up, his pants were ripped and wallet gone, which contained $400 in cash, three credit cards, his VA medical card, school identification, metro card and driver’s license.“I remember this group of teens harassing me while I was eating, they surrounded my table and kept on asking me ‘Do you believe black lives matter,'” Marquez told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “Then they started calling me a racist. I can’t recall if they were saying anything else to me at this moment because the blow to my head really screwed up my memory.”DeAnthony Mason, manager of the McDonald’s, reviewed security footage and told Marquez in a phone call Saturday that when he left the restaurant a teen with a white shirt struck him on the side of the head, knocking him unconscious. The other teens then converged on his incapacitated body, taking his belongings. The head blow Marquez sustained left his memory dazed, but Mason’s review of security footage helped him piece together what occurred.Upon regaining consciousness, Marquez found a cab driver willing to drive him to his apartment across from American University, where he attends school. Workers in the lobby called the police on his behalf, who took him to George Washington Hospital where he was evaluated for several hours. Medical documents obtained by TheDCNF show Marquez was treated for head trauma and an eye contusion.Credit card transactions reviewed by TheDCNF reveal that the assailants charged over $115 on his various credit cards at a liquor store, Five Guys and Walmart. Mason, the McDonald’s store manager told Marquez that police have been looking for the group of teens for a previous incident.“I believe this was a hate crime and I was targeted because of my skin color,” Marquez told TheDCNF. “Too many of these types of attacks have been happening against white people by members of the black community and the majority of the main stream media refuses to report on it.”Marquez served eight years active duty in the Marines between 2003 and 2011 in Iraq and Afghanistan as a Rifleman and Scout Sniper. He received the Bronze Star for valor during his first deployment after he carried the body of his slain team leader from combat following an ambush during the Battle of Fallujah.“When I was in the Marine Corps, I served with people from many different backgrounds, ethnicities, religions, and races,” Marquez told TheDCNF. “Like all Marines, I fought for the freedom of all Americans and not just one particular group.”Marquez was also involved in the infamous fire fight dubbed “Hell House” in Fallujah. He and a fellow Marine, Dane Shaffer, pulled out four Marines who were stuck in a house after an insurgent ambush. A picture taken of them pulling Sgt Maj Brad Kasal out of battle served as the inspiration for a famous war memorial of Iraq located in California, reports The Los Angeles Times. Marquez is pictured on the left side holding Kasal by his right arm.Officer Anthony Hector of the Metropolitan Police Department is currently investigating the alleged assault. TheDCNF reached out to the MPD for comment but no further details could be provided at this time. Marquez described roughly 5 black assailants including one female, ages 16 to 21.Marquez told TheDCNF, “I really think this group of teens is dangerous and will do this type of thing again if they are not caught.”",2016/02/15,snopes,1

The classification is offered to charitable, religious and educational organizations that operate as nonprofits. Under the Obama administration IRS political appointees illegally targeted conservative groups, either making them wait up to seven years for tax-exempt status or denying their application altogether. Judicial Watch uncovered that scandal and has obtained piles of government records showing how the IRS illegally colluded with another federal agency to single out groups with conservative-sounding terms such as patriot and Tea Party in their titles when applying for tax-exempt status.In the meantime, leftist groups like the Satan club got fast tracked. The principle goal of establishing the Satan clubs in public schools throughout Washington State appears to be to counter existing enterprises operated by a Christian-based group. Documents obtained by Judicial Watch include the process of establishing an after-school Satan club at Point Defiance Elementary in Tacoma. The entity behind the club is a nonprofit called Reason Alliance, which is based in Somerville, Massachusetts, and operates in Washington State as the Satanic Temple of Seattle. Its director, Lilith X. Starr, established the Point Defiance Elementary Satanic club, the records show. In its application the club states that its purpose is character development and that adult instructors are vetted by the Satanic Temples Executive Ministry. Children ages 5-12 will develop basic critical reasoning, character qualities, problem solving and creative expression, according to the Satanic Temple filings included in the documents. The club logo is a pencil with devils horns. Records obtained by Judicial Watch from the Treasury Department show that the Satanic cult applied for tax-exempt status on October 21, 2014 and received it on October 31, 2014.The parent permission forms ask for the name of the childs church and pastor, the records show. They also reveal that Starr, the Seattle Satanic Temple director, told Tacoma School District Superintendent Carla Santorno that the clubs are led by caring Satanists and each child receives a membership card. Starr also tells the superintendent that the effort to establish after-school Satan clubs in Tacoma schools is in direct response to the Christian-based Good News Clubs operating in campuses throughout the district. This ignited concern among some Tacoma district officials, the records show. In one electronic mail exchange, Tacoma Schools official Andrea O-Brien-Henley sends colleague Paul Koch a citation from the Satanic Temples website noting that the temple only wants to establish after-school Satan clubs in school districts with Christian Good News Clubs. OBrien-Henley notes that its odd that the Satanic Temple only targets schools that have Good News Clubs, writing to hear colleague: If they really want to get their message out to kids it seems kind of odd that they would only be targeting schools with a Good News Club; one would think that they would want to start clubs anywhere there is an *interest* in them.Heres the citation that OBrien-Henley forwarded to fellow school district official Koch from the Satanic Temples website: How do I start an After School Satan Club in my school district? If there isnt a chapter of The Satanic Temple near you, but youre interested in starting and After School Satan Club in your school district, please contact The Satanic Temple. Please keep in mind that the Satanic Temple is not interested in operating After School Satan Clubs in school districts that are not already hosting the Good News Club. However, The Satanic Temple ultimately intends to have After School Satan Clubs operating in every school district where the Good News Club is represented.In another exchange, the Executive Director of Communications for the Tacoma School District, Dan Voelpel, expresses concern to colleagues that people will confuse the school districts message of tolerance toward the Satan Club with tolerance toward alleged hate-related activities around the country in the wake of the presidential election. In the records the principal of Point Defiance Elementary reveals that, two weeks after the Satan club was launched, no one had signed up for it. The fact remains however, that the IRS fast-tracked a deranged Satanic cult to operate as a nonprofit in taxpayer-funded elementary schools. Toward The Past: Leftist Fight Club at Public Fla.

Pete Sessions in the March 4 Republican primary, acknowledges the mistake. She told police then, and repeated recently, that she was talked into shoplifting by a friend.“Like an idiot, I went along for the ride,” Pierson said in a recent interview.She and the other woman were accused of trying to lift nine pieces of women’s clothing from a J.C. Penney store in Plano. They stuffed the clothes into shoe boxes in a clumsy, failed heist.According to a Plano police report, Pierson said she and the woman with her, Laura Elizabeth Nelson, told police they needed the clothes for jobs they were trying to obtain.Pierson told police she was “scared at first and did not want to go through with it.”Pierson exited the store with four items of clothing in a shoe box inside her shopping bag. They were valued at $168. The report said Pierson had her young son with her when the incident occurred.She was booked into the Plano City Jail. She eventually pleaded no contest to the charges and received deferred adjudication.“That’s what the attorney guy told me to do,” she said. “My defense was as good as I could afford.”Pierson, a tea party leader from Garland, said she knew her background would be open for scrutiny if she decided to take on Sessions, the powerful incumbent.Pierson says the incident helped turn her life around, showing her that mistakes often come with consequences.And the 37-year-old says the shoplifting charge was nothing compared with what could have happened in her life.Pierson says she was born to a 15-year-old mother and grew up exposed to the wrong crowd, folks involved in gangs and other unsavory activities. An early marriage lasted just three months.“I’m surprised I made it out,” Pierson said.Pierson said Sessions’ supporters are mounting a smear campaign, but added that she has nothing to hide.A Sessions spokesman declined to comment on the arrest. Sessions has said he’s never been arrested.Pierson says she’s willing to discuss her shoplifting charge, and other issues, with Sessions, chiding her opponent for refusing to consent to a public debate before the primary.“Why don’t we both meet up in a public forum and talk about it?” she said.Follow Gromer Jeffers Jr. on Twitter at @gromerjeffers.View Comments",2014/02/14,snopes,1

The “ranking member” (sometimes “RkMembs”) is the title given to the senior-most member of the committee not in the majority party.Freshmen/Sophomores: Freshmen and sophomores are Members of Congress whose first term (in the same chamber at the end of the 114th Congress) was the 114th Congress (freshmen) or 113th (sophomores). Members of Congress who took office within the last few months of a Congress are considered freshmen in the next Congress as well.site Menu",2017/06/09,snopes,0

The dip came after Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, announced on Tuesday his plans to resign amid an internal White House struggle over Mr. Trump’s plan to impose large tariffs on steel and aluminum imports .Regardless, Mr. Trump’s trade claims are often overstated and contradicted by his own economic council. Here is a fact-check of recent comments that Mr. Trump has made on trade deficits, the World Trade Organization and tariffs.From Bush 1 to present, our Country has lost more than 55,000 factories, 6,000,000 manufacturing jobs and accumulated Trade Deficits of more than 12 Trillion Dollars. Last year we had a Trade Deficit of almost 800 Billion Dollars. Bad Policies & Leadership. Must WIN again! #MAGA— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 7, 2018“From Bush 1 to present, our Country has lost more than 55,000 factories, 6,000,000 manufacturing jobs and accumulated Trade Deficits of more than 12 Trillion Dollars.” — March 7 post on TwitterThis needs context.From January 1989 to January 2018, the number of manufacturing jobs in the United States has decreased by about 5.5 million . There also were about 77,000 fewer domestic manufacturing factories, workshops and what the Census Bureau terms as “establishments” in 2014 — the latest year with available data — than in 1989.But it’s not accurate to attribute all of these declines to trade, even if globalization clearly did contribute. Economists say technology had a role to play, too. As New York Times reporter Claire Cain Miller has written for the Upshot , multiple studies have found that industries like steel, computers and electronics were hit hard by automation.“Last year we had a Trade Deficit of almost 800 Billion Dollars.” — March 7 post on TwitterThis is exaggerated.Mr. Trump has cited this figure more than 50 times since 2015.A White House spokesman said the $800 billion deficit figure that Mr. Trump has cited refers to the trade balance in goods. The Department of Commerce reported a $810 billion deficit in goods in 2017, but a total trade deficit of $566 billion that includes a trade surplus in services.Mr. Trump’s preoccupation with trade in goods contradicts his own White House economic report , which he signed and was released in February.The United States’ economy has shifted “away from manufacturing and toward service provision industries” in recent decades, according the report. “Focusing only on the trade in goods alone ignores the United States’ comparative advantage in services.”Like most developed countries, the United States is primarily a services economy, said Scott Lincicome, a trade analyst at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. And American service sectors — like accounting, finance, technology, engineering and law — are globally dominant.“By focusing only on goods, you make it seem far weaker than it actually is,” Mr. Lincicome said. Doing so also means “ignoring a large, growing and vibrant part of the economy,” he said.“We have a deficit of approximately $500 billion a year with China.” — March 6 remarksThis is exaggerated.Even if Mr. Trump is referring only to the trade deficit in goods, he is off by more than $100 billion. The Commerce Department reported a deficit of $375 billion in goods with China in 2017. Overall, the United States had a net deficit of $309 billion in 2016.“We have massive trade deficits with Canada and Mexico.” — March 5 post on TwitterPartly true.In fact, the United States had a total trade surplus of $7.7 billion with Canada in 2016, and a surplus of $4.4 billion through the third quarter of 2017.“Massive” is a matter of opinion, but the United States did have a trade deficit of $63 billion with Mexico in 2016, and $52.2 billion through the third quarter of 2017.“If the E.U. wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on U.S. companies doing business there, we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the U.S. They make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there. Big trade imbalance!” — March 3 post on TwitterFalse.The European Union imposes a 10 percent tariff on American-made cars, while the United States’ tariff against imported European cars is just 2.5 percent. But that doesn’t mean American cars are “impossible” to sell in Europe.The United States is the third largest car exporter in the world, sending almost 70,000 cars to Britain, France, Norway and Switzerland in 2014, according to the Commerce Department. The Observatory of Economic Complexity at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology reported that the United States exported $11.8 billion in cars to Europe in 2016.“When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win.” — March 2 post on TwitterThis is exaggerated.Actually, the United States had a trade surplus with five out of 15 major trading partners in 2016, including Brazil ($22 billion), Singapore ($18 billion) and Britain ($14.7 billion).Mr. Trump’s economic report also cautioned against counting trade deficits as losses or as a metric of economic health. It argued that deficits reflect myriad factors, including the strength of the dollar.“The United States has been able to sustain a trade deficit in part because of the role of the U.S. dollar in the global economy,” according to the report. “Foreigners are happy to hold U.S. dollars and dollar-denominated assets, which they obtain by selling more goods and services to Americans than they buy.”And as The New York Times’ economic correspondent Jim Tankersley has reported :“Most economists do not see the trade gap as money ‘lost’ to other countries, nor do they worry about trade deficits to a large degree. That’s because trade imbalances are affected by a host of macroeconomic factors, including the relative growth rates of countries, the value of their currencies, and their saving and investment rates. For instance, America’s trade deficit narrowed dramatically during the Great Recession, when national consumption faltered.”“We put tariffs on washing machines coming into the country. ...Now we have plants being built; put a 30 percent tariff on.” — March 1 listening sessionThis confuses certain tariffs and exaggerates their impact.Mr. Trump slapped steep tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels in January. He appears to have mixed up the rates for the two products.Solar panels face a 30 percent tariff. The first 1.2 million washing machines that are imported in 2018 face a 20 percent tariff; that levy grows to 50 percent against every machine afterward that comes into the United States. Those penalties are gradually phased down in the second and third year of the three-year tariff program.Complaints by Whirlpool Inc. about its Korean competitors prompted the White House action. It has since said it added 200 jobs to a plant in Ohio in anticipation of demand resulting from the tariffs. It has not announced construction of any new plants.Samsung and LG Electronics have said they will accelerate plans to open plants in the United States following the tariff announcement. But Samsung announced its plans to build a factory in South Carolina last June and LG said it would build a new facility in Tennessee in February 2017 .“But the World Trade Organization makes it almost impossible for us to do good business. We lose the cases, we don’t have the judges. We have a minority of judges.” — Feb. 26 speech to governorsThis is misleading.Mr. Trump’s claims of bias are contradicted by his own economic report.The United States has won more cases than the global average. According to the White House report, “the United States has won 85.7 percent of the cases it has initiated before the W.T.O. since 1995, compared with a global average of 84.4 percent. In contrast, China’s success rate is just 66.7 percent.”In cases where the United States is the respondent, “it still wins 25 percent of the time, a rate that is better than the global average rate of 16.6 percent,” the report noted. That rate is far better than the rates of the European Union and Japan (which have never won a case brought against them) and China (which has won only 5.3 percent of the time).Correction: Because of an editing error involving a satirical text-swapping web browser extension, an earlier version of this article misquoted a passage from an article by the Times reporter Jim Tankersley. The sentence referred to America’s narrowing trade deficit during “the Great Recession,” not during “the Time of Shedding and Cold Rocks.” (Pro tip: Disable your “Millennials to Snake People” extension when copying and pasting.)Linda Qiu is a fact-check reporter, based in Washington.

Jordan and Lupita Nyong’o have been added to the watch list, with little justification other than seeming “suspicious.” “It’s an imperfect process,” says one source within the FBI. “But if anything uses the words ‘black’ and ‘panther’ we’re all over it.” Both members of the cast and members of the actual Black Panthers have expressed confusion at the maneuver. “I don’t understand why I’ve been put on a watch list,” said Lupita Nyong’o, who played Nakia. “It has nothing to do with the Black Panther Party. Has anyone at the FBI even seen it?” “I’m an actor, not an actual Black Panther,” said Michael B. Jordan, who has witnessed several unmarked vehicles parked outside of his residence in Sherman Oaks, CA. “With all due respect, the FBI is wildin’. Did they even see the movie?” “As inhumane and biased as the FBI’s actions toward the BPP have been in the past, this is a grave injustice,” added playwright, professor, and former Black Panther Jamal Joseph. “It just seems like they are being watched as a result of our government’s ongoing campaign against anyone who celebrates blackness. Also, has anyone at the FBI seen the film?” But the FBI has remained firm in their stance. “The Bureau will not bend to the will of those who choose to be linked to domestic terrorist organizations,” iterated Michael P.

Clinton's new constituents -- to $5,000 from Mr. and Mrs. Bill Brandt of Winnetka, Ill. Actor-actress couple Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen of Los Angeles spent $4,787 for china, but they didn't quite match the $4,920 that movie director and producer Steven Spielberg and his wife, actress Kate Capshaw, paid for the china they gave the Clintons. Altogether, the Clintons reported receiving $21,819 worth of china. The Clintons will have no problem with silver and flatware for their guests in the future: They received five gifts of flatware worth a total of $17,966, including $4,944 worth of settings from Ghada Irani of Los Angeles and $4,967 worth from Edith Wasserman of Beverly Hills. One of the biggest gifts was from Steve Mittman of New York, who gave the Clintons two sofas, an easy chair and ottoman worth $19,900. That was more than double the value of the china cabinet, travel humidor, chandelier and copy of Abraham Lincoln's Cooper Union speech, together worth $9,683, from Mr. and Mrs. Walter Kaye, of New York. In addition, the Clintons left the White House with $52,021 worth of furniture, $71,650 in artworks and three carpets valued at $12,282. Bill Clinton's 1968 class at Georgetown University gave the former president and new senator a basket by artist Dale Chihuly said to be worth $38,000, and Chihuly gave the couple a $22,000 glass sculpture. In addition to the home furnishings, the most common gift given to the Clintons was golf equipment. Ten people gave drivers, putters and other golf paraphernalia worth $300 to $650. Actor Jack Nicholson gave Clinton a $350 driver. Actor Sylvester Stallone gave the couple boxing gloves. In seven previous years, the most the Clintons had reported receiving in gifts was $23,602 in 1999. Clinton's predecessor in the White House, George Bush, listed $52,853 in gifts in 1992.

Mark Blinch/Reuters When the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were married, in 2011, the Obamas were left off the guest list because of the added security costs of protecting the president. The day of the wedding, thousands of Britons took the day off, and about 1,900 guests attended the ceremony in Westminster Abbey in central London. The Obamas traveled to the U.K. less than a month later for an official state visit. Since Obama is no longer president, he doesnt require as extensive a security detail as he once did.If Trump were to appear at Prince Harrys wedding in spring 2018, it would likely spark protests. When Prime Minister Theresa May offered Trump a state visit early this year, polls showed that 2 million people intended to take part in a protest against him. The risk of embarrassment, were such a protest to occur at a royal wedding, might put the couple off inviting such a controversial figure.Instead of a state visit, Trumps trip to the U.K., scheduled for early 2018, has been cast as a working trip where he will not meet the queen.

Their right-wing nationalist slogan, “Blood and Soil,” romanticizes the notion that people with “white blood” have a special bond with “American soil.” This philosophy originated in Germany (as Blut und Boden) and was popularized by Hitler’s regime. VA uses “For Race and Nation” as an alternative slogan. Along those lines, the VA manifesto (as of April 2018) maintains that “The racial stock of this nation was created for white Christian Anglo/Europeans by white Christian Anglo/Europeans. All other ethnicities, races, religions and demographics are absolutely not compatible with this nation’s original culture. With such being stated, a mass exodus, isolation, apartheid, segregation and/or separation must be implemented to retain the good order and longevity of the country.”Originally, VA (then called American Vanguard), was firmly in the alt-right hemisphere, and focused on white identity. Over time, however, VA has increasingly embraced a neo-Nazi ideology. In one iteration of their manifesto, posted in February 2017, the VA explained that America was built on the foundation of White European culture and that the “glory of the Aryan nation must be recaptured.” VA has also warned against the influence of “the international Jew,” tweeting in July 2017, “Those behind the subversive elements eroding our culture often have something in common. Jewish influence is prevalent, invasive, dangerous.” This theme is echoed in their 2018 manifesto, which states that “Islam, Judaism and all other non-European or foreign religions” should not have the freedom to practice in the United States.Beware the International Jew (Vanguard America website)In 2017, VA broadened their ties to the neo-Nazi movement when they participated in white supremacist rallies in Pikeville, Kentucky (April), and Shelbyville, Tennessee (October). These events were organized by the Nationalist Front (NF), an umbrella organization of neo-Nazis, traditional white supremacists and racist skinheads. VA became a member of the NF following the April rally.Organizational structureDillon Ulysses Hopper (previously known as Dillon Irizarry), a Marine Corps veteran from New Mexico, has been leading the group since early 2016. During an April 2017 speech at a private NF gathering in Kentucky, Irizarry said that VA started in California in 2015. Irizarry also said that the “future is about the youth” and (for that reason) his group base is 18 to 24 years old. At the time, he also claimed approximately 200 members in 20 states.Dillon Hopper speaks during ""White Lives Matter"" rally in Shelbyville, TN.VA has some paramilitary characteristics. In states with open carry laws, members, including Hopper, who uses the title “Commander,” have openly carried firearms during rallies and protests. The standard uniform for members consists of khaki pants and a white polo shirt. At several venues, members have stood and marched in military-style formations, and utilized military facing movements and rest positions.Membership is typically male. However, VA does have a women’s division. In June 2017, VA tweeted, “The woman has her own battlefield. With every child that she brings into the world, she fights her battle for the nation. Strong nations grow from strong families. Vanguard America Women’s Division.”From November 2016 to April 2017, Vanguard America increased its ranks, and counted active members in Arkansas, California, Florida, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Texas and Washington.Diminishing ReturnsThe group’s high point was June 17, 2017, when several dozen VA members participated in a “Texas is Ours” rally at the state capital in Austin. Hopper spoke at the event, and was joined by Thomas Rousseau, the leader of VA’s Texas chapter. After the event Hopper complained that Rousseau led event organizers to believe that Rousseau, not Hopper, was VA’s leader, and that Rousseau’s lengthy speech at the rally further confused people about the group’s leadership.VA members stand in formation during the “Texas is Ours” rally.A few days after the Austin rally, Rousseau began his takeover of the VA’s servers and its website. In an exchange that was posted on Twitter, Hopper detailed Rousseau’s apparent betrayal, writing, “On June 20, Thomas underhandedly and deceitfully exiled me from all Vanguard discord servers that HE controlled due to ‘security reasons.’ I logged off…and when I got back an hour later I was banned from every single server, including the women’s server. It was literally a coup with the guise that I left to handle family matters.”Just a few weeks later, with Hopper conspicuously absent, Rousseau led several dozen Vanguard America Texas members and associates at the August 12th “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Though Rousseau led the Unite the Right contingent, it was Hopper who faced derision in the rally’s aftermath when event images showed James Alex Fields Jr., who is accused of plowing his car into a group of counter-protesters and killing Heather Heyer, at the event standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Vanguard America members, and carrying a shield bearing the group’s fascist symbol. VA has denied that Fields was ever a member of their group.In late August 2017, as Hopper isolated himself from the fallout from Unite the Right, Rousseau seized the moment. Rather than take over the troubled Vanguard America name, he opted to rebrand VA’s “bloodandsoil.org” as the Patriot Front website. The move allowed Rousseau’s followers to distance themselves from both Vanguard America and any association with James Fields. Ironically, many of those who defected to Rousseau’s Patriot Front also attended “Unite the Right” under the Vanguard America umbrella.Following the August split, Patriot Front slowly siphoned away VA members from other parts of the country, and VA membership and activity dropped off dramatically. When Hopper spoke at the October 2017 “White Lives Rally” in Shelbyville he was supported by a crew of just seven VA members.VA members pose with Hopper (center) during the Shelbyville rally.VA was further diminished in January 2018, when more infighting and accusations of ineffective leadership led to the formation of a second splinter group, National Socialist Legion (NSL). NSL is a neo-Nazi group whose strategy (according to a March 2018 4chan post) is to set up homesteading cells around the country “for future white migration and eventual white revolt and secession.”VA members from Texas and Tennessee played a role in NSL’s creation. As of April 2018, the ADL has documented NSL activity (mostly in the form of flier distributions) and identified members in California, Tennessee, Texas, Indiana, Florida, North Carolina and Colorado.NSL’s symbol and one of the group’s fliers (found in Colorado)ActivityVanguard America is best known for posting white supremacist flyers at universities across the country throughout the 2016-2017 school year; ADL counted thirty-two incidents during that time in Arkansas, California, Florida, Indiana, Maryland, New Jersey, Oregon, Texas, Virginia and Washington. The group’s campus fliering continued during the 2017-2018 school year, but to a lesser extent and with a smaller geographical reach: just fourteen incidents in Arizona, Tennessee, Texas, and Massachusetts.In addition to distributing racist and anti-Semitic fliers on campus, Vanguard America has directly targeted Jewish and Hispanic institutions with hateful propaganda. Incidents include:Dallas, Texas, March 3, 2018: Racist, anti-immigration VA fliers were found at the Casa Guanajuato Community Center.Rome, Georgia, October 13, 2017: An anti-Semitic VA flier was posted at a synagogue: “America will bathe in the light of the black sun! The tide of Jewish Globalism wanes.”Houston, Texas, July 16, 2017: Two synagogues reported anti-Semitic VA flyers taped to signs, doors and gates on their property.Lakewood, New Jersey, July 2, 2017: An anti-Semitic VA banner was hung at the Holocaust memorial.Shreveport, Louisiana, March 11, 2017: VA stickers were reported at two synagogues.Vanguard America has also organized small public events and participated in events organized by other white supremacist groups. These events have included events focused on the preservation of Confederate monuments, anti-Muslim protests and events billed as “free speech rallies.” Recent public activity includes:Providence, Rhode Island, January 20, 2018: A VA banner bearing the words, “feminists deserve the rope” was hung over a nearby overpass during the Women’s March.Toledo, Ohio, December 4, 2017: VA posters were placed over a Black Lives Matter banner at Toledo University and on the door of the Lucas County Democratic Party officeShelbyville, Tennessee, October 28, 2017: Approximately seven VA members, led by Hopper, attended a Nationalist Front-organized “White Lives Matter” rally.Charlottesville, Virginia, August 12, 2017: Several dozen VA members, along with other groups associated with the Nationalist Front, participated in the Unite the Right rally.Austin, Texas, July 16, 2017: VA members waved a “For Race and Nation” banner from a highway overpass.Washington D.C., June 25, 2017: VA members participated in a free speech rally with Richard Spencer and Identity Evropa.

Honey has been reported to be effective in a number of human pathologies. Clinical studies have demonstrated that application of honey to severely infected cutaneous wounds rapidly clears infection from the wound and improves tissue healing. A large number of in vitro and limited clinical studies have confirmed the broad-spectrum antimicrobial (antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and antimycobacterial) properties of honey, which may be attributed to the acidity (low pH), osmotic effect, high sugar concentration, presence of bacteriostatic and bactericidal factors (hydrogen peroxide, antioxidants, lysozyme, polyphenols, phenolic acids, flavonoids, methylglyoxal, and bee peptides), and increase in cytokine release, and to immune modulating and anti-inflammatory properties of honey; the antimicrobial action involves several mechanisms.

CERN is a frequent target of Doomsday theories [Image Credit: Ryan F. Mandelbaum]Related PostsRyan F. Mandelbaum • October 1, 2015The world was supposed to end in September 2015.While some people thought NASA forgot to tell them about an asteroid collision, others thought the Large Hadron Collider, the seven-mile-wide atom smasher, would open a portal to hell.NASA dismissed the asteroid theory with a statement widely publicized in the news and on social media. But press officers at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, known as CERN, in Geneva, Switzerland, which runs the Large Hadron Collider, took a different approach. They quietly buried a fact sheet titled “CERN answers queries from social media,” containing no mention of the supposed Sept. 23 apocalypse, on their own press website.Doomsday theorists frequently blame international labs like CERN for putting the world in danger. But while you may think of these theorists as crackpots, their doomsday ideas have a lot in common with government conspiracy theories that often appear on social media today. And there’s a science to handling government conspiracy theories.Conspiracy theories flourish when a government organization is involved in an event that the general public can’t quite comprehend, like the 1969 lunar landing, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy or scientific discoveries at places like CERN.“Any time there is a situation where there is a lack of information,” said Dr. Viren Swami , psychologist at Anglia Ruskin University in the United Kingdom, “people are much more likely to explain that with a conspiracy theory.”Presenting curious minds with a list of facts without trying to proselytize and allowing people to analyze facts on their own may be the best way to dispel conspiracy theories, he said.The most recent apocalyptic scare demonstrated Swami’s theory in action.CERN needed to target the places where the theory was most popular while constructing their response. The September theory “was huge on social media but it was only on social media,” said Arnaud Marsollier, CERN’s press chief . “If we had published something it would have been buzz for sure.”Major news outlets did not cover the doomsday theory involving CERN, so a published press release would only worry CERN’s 1.25 million Twitter followers and 500,000 Facebook followers.The particle physics community has needed to respond to more publicized doomsday theories in the past.In a 2005 paper, a physicist theorized that the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), a device similar to the LHC on Long Island in New York, could create black holes. A New York Times article scared laypeople, who think that black holes eat planets. But RHIC’s black holes were “theoretical, imaginary black holes,” that could never cause any harm to Earth, according to the RHIC website. The New York Times coverage forced RHIC press officers to address the conspiracy theories directly and publicly, but the CERN release shows that conspiracy theorists still believe that particle colliders create black holes today.Swami thought that CERN’s quiet approach to the September social media rumors was the more effective.Although CERN did not promote its news releases on social media, a quick Google search of “Sept. 23 CERN” puts the press release the top of the results. Would-be theorists can analyze the science and purpose of CERN on their own with an easily digestible list of facts, without feeling forced to take a side on whether or not the world will end.That method had worked for Irving Baxter, a longtime doomsday theorist and head minister at the Endtime Ministries in Texas, in the past.“There’s this problem because like charges repel and they can’t tell what keeps the protons at the center of the atom, why atoms don’t blow apart,” said Baxter, explaining CERN’s work. He hadn’t read the Sept. 23 release, but he had previously found online information about the experiment on his own. Baxter praised the work at CERN and did not feel it nor any other particle accelerator had anything to do with his Armageddon theory.Ultimately, Sept. 23 came and went, the world did not end, and scientists continued their work at CERN.But CERN will probably always have to deal with conspiracy theories, Marsollier said. “The end of the world is announced every year.”",2016/01/01,snopes,0

""What's happening is we are having more people coming bringing children with them entering between the ports of entry, between the ports of entry illegally, and they're not, you cannot give them immunity. That's an offense. We believe every person that enters the country illegally like that should be prosecuted.""He argued that most of the detained children are teenagers and therefore more capable of taking care of themselves than infants or toddlers. While Sessions claims that Health and Human Services (HHS) takes care of these separated youths, he remained firm on prosecuting their parents who choose to bring them to the country ""recklessly and improperly and illegally.""When families enter the country illegally , the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) can only keep children for 72 hours. After this, DHS continues to oversee prosecution of the parents, while their children then come under the management of HHS.Essentially, federal law requires the children and adults to be kept in separate facilities, which is further complicated by the parents' prosecution.""If people don't want to be separated from their children, they should not bring them with them,"" Sessions said. ""We've got to get this message out. You're not given immunity. You have to, you will be prosecuted if you bring, if you come illegally. And if you bring children, you'll still be prosecuted.""While Sessions said it's not necessarily the Trump administration's goal to separate children and families, he stated that ""it's legitimate to warn people"" that coming to the United States illegally may result in split families.Hewitt then asked Sessions, as a grandfather, to imagine what it would be like for his own grandchildren to be separated from their parents for a period of 72 hours or more and the impact that may have.""Hugh, you can't, the United States can't be a total guarantor that every parent who comes to the country unlawfully with a child is guaranteed that they won't be, is guaranteed that they will be able to have their hand on that child the entire time. That's just not the way it works,"" he responded.Session said he wishes the United States could afford to keep parents and children together after illegal immigrants are detained, but remained adamant that unlawful border crossers must be federally prosecuted.Hewitt asked the attorney general if these separated children should be granted legal counsel in order to navigate the immigration system. He made the case that while it is not a Constitutional right, as it is for U.S. citizens, that perhaps it's a ""moral right.""Sessions disagreed.""No, I don't think it's a moral right, Hugh. No, no,"" Sessions said. ""If you come to the country, you should come through, first, through the port of entry and make a claim of asylum if you think you have a legitimate asylum claim. You shouldn't try to get across the border at some desert site, some remote site unlawfully and expect not to be promptly deported. We've caught, over the years, millions of people, and they've been promptly deported. They don't get trial in federal court.""© 2018 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.",2018/06/05,snopes,0

It must remain so here in Australia.“Outside of this, all offenses against children must be reported to the authorities, and we are absolutely committed to doing so.”“We understand the significance of religious confession – in particular, the inviolability of the confessional seal to people of some faiths, particularly the Catholic faith”, said the report. “However, we heard evidence of a number of instances where disclosures of child sexual abuse were made in religious confession, by both victims and perpetrators.”We are satisfied that confession is a forum where Catholic children have disclosed their sexual abuse and where clergy have disclosed their abusive behavior in order to deal with their own guilt.”Archbishop Hart, who’s also the President of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, argued that the confessional seal should remain protected from the law, saying in a statement: “It is a fundamental part of the freedom of religion, and it is recognized in the law of Australia and many other countries. It must remain so here in Australia.”Outside of this, all offenses against children must be reported to the authorities, and we are absolutely committed to doing so.”Independent reports: Asked on Tuesday if he would rather go to prison than breach the seal of confession, he told ABC Radio Melbourne:“I’ve said that I would.”I believe that this is an absolutely sacrosanct communication of a higher order.”“I would go to extreme lengths outside of the confessional to make sure that the law was observed. “But there are some matters which are of a higher order, things to do with God.”His stance was backed by other high-profile clerics, including his Brisbane counterpart Mark Coleridge and priest and lawyer Frank Brennan, who he said he would “conscientiously refuse to comply with the law” if it was changed.Writing in the Sydney Morning Herald, Father Brennan suggested requiring clerics to report abuse allegations would make children less safe because it “may take away the one possibility that a sex offender will repent and turn himself in”.But lawyer Vivian Walker, who has represented child sex abuse victims, welcomed the commission’s recommendations. “I think it’s about time the Catholic Church was dragged out of the dark ages,” she said. “We can no longer think about sexual offending against children as some kind of forgivable sin.”In its submission to the commission, the Catholic Church’s Trust Justice and Healing Council argued requiring priests to disclose information heard during confession would undermine freedom of religion.“The whole concept of confession in the Catholic Church is built on repentance, forgiveness, and penance,” said Frances Sullivan, the council’s chief executive.”Part of this forgiveness process, certainly in the case of a child sex-abuser, would normally require they turn themselves in to the police.”But the commission’s report stressed:“The right to practice one’s religious beliefs must accommodate civil society’s obligation to provide for the safety of all and, in particular, children’s safety from sexual abuse.”Reporting information relevant to child sexual abuse to the police is critical to ensuring the safety of children.”Australia’s Parliament will decide whether to enact the changes contained in the report.Archbishop Hart’s predecessor at the Diocese of Melbourne, Cardinal George Pell, is due to face trial on multiple sex charges later this year.236.4k",2017/08/20,snopes,1

The group believes up to one-third of the bombs dropped over Laos did not explode, leaving the land-locked country contaminated with vast quantities of unexploded ordnance that has killed or injured 20,000 Lao people since the bombing ended.“For our part, we have been steadily increasing our commitment to clearing unexploded ordnance in Laos, which has caused significant human suffering and been an impediment to development since the conclusion of the Vietnam War ,” Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes said prior to the president’s trip. “We've been spending additional resources each year as it relates to clearing unexploded ordnance, and we anticipate the president will make this a focus of his visit.”The United States has already spent $118 million cleaning up unexploded ordnance in Laos since 1992.Beyond addressing that dark issue, White House officials say the president will work to promote the 12-country trade deal known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, and spread his message on climate change .On Tuesday, the president will kick off his visit with a bilateral meeting with Bounnhang Vorachith, the President of Laos, to identify areas of cooperation, such as developing education and health infrastructure, and increasing the U.S.-Lao bilateral trade and investment relationship.On Wednesday, Obama takes a day trip to Luang Prabang, Laos – where he’ll visit the Wat Xieng Thong Temple and hold a town hall meeting with Asian youths. He was also expected to hold a bilateral meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines , but that encounter is now highly in doubt after the Filipino president called Obama a “son of a b----” on Monday and warned him not to question his policy of extrajudicial killings, estimated at 2,400 people since he took power in June, in his war on drugs.Obama called Duterte ""a colorful guy"" and signaled that the meeting could be called off if it's determined that a face-to-face gathering won't be productive.""When and if we have a meeting this is something that will be brought up,"" the president guaranteed, telling reporters that he hopes the tensions can be dealt with constructively. Obama emphasized that he would surely address the necessity to approach the drug trafficking war in a ""way that is consistent with international norms.""The president added that he instructed his staff to talk to their Filipino counterparts to gauge whether a bilateral meeting would be fruitful in Laos.Obama’s visit to Vientiane follows a stop in Hangzhou, China, where he attended the G-20 summit of global economic powers.

This study investigated the safety of oral administration of fluralaner in chewable tablets to dogs at the highest recommended treatment dose and at multiples of this dose.MethodsThirty-two (16 male and 16 female) healthy 8-week old Beagle dogs weighing 2.0 - 3.6 kg at first administration were included in the study. Fluralaner was administered on three occasions at 8-week intervals at doses of up to 56, 168, and 280 mg fluralaner/kg body weight, equivalent to 1, 3, and 5 times the highest recommended treatment dose of fluralaner; sham dosed dogs served as controls.During the study, all dogs were clinically observed, and their health was carefully monitored including body weight development, food consumption and measurement of hematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry (including measurement of levels of ACTH and C-reactive protein) and urinalysis. Following euthanasia of the dogs, complete gross post mortem examination, including organ weight determination, and histopathological examination of multiple tissues were conducted.ResultsThere were no clinical findings related to fluralaner treatment. Statistically significant differences between the treated groups and the control group were observed for some clinical pathology parameters and organ weights; none of these findings were considered to be of clinical relevance.ConclusionsOral administration of fluralaner at the highest recommended treatment dose (56 mg/kg) at 8-week intervals is well tolerated and has a safety margin of more than five in healthy dogs eight weeks of age or older and weighing at least 2 kg.Keywords: Fluralaner, Dog, Safety, Bravecto™BackgroundFluralaner is a novel systemically administered insecticidal and acaricidal product that provides long acting efficacy after oral administration to dogs. Fluralaner belongs to a new class of compounds with antiparasitic activity, the isoxazolines. These compounds have activity against γ-aminobutyric acid- (GABA-) and glutamate-gated chloride channels with significant selectivity for insect neurons over mammalian neurons [ 1 ]. A field study has shown that a single fluralaner dose administered orally to dogs provides at least twelve weeks of flea- and tick control [ 2 ]. This long duration of activity offers a more convenient treatment over monthly flea and tick control treatments with a potential compliance advantage.This study was designed to demonstrate the safety of this systemic treatment and to investigate any possible health impact from repeated oral administration to healthy dogs of either the highest recommended dose or multiple overdoses.MethodsThis randomized, parallel-group, blinded study included 32 (16 male and 16 female) healthy 8-week old Beagle dogs. A total of 24 dogs received fluralaner repeatedly and 8 sham dosed dogs served as controls. The study design was based on VICH GL 43 target animal safety requirements for veterinary pharmaceutical products [ 3 ].This study was conducted in Ireland in compliance with the Irish national animal protection legislation framework. The study plan was approved by the ethics committee of Charles River Laboratories Preclinical Services Ireland Ltd. The experimental license number of the investigator was B100/3771.Beagle pups were enrolled in the study on day -14 (start of acclimation) and were found to be healthy on initial physical and clinical pathological evaluation. Dogs received sulfadiazine and trimethoprim during acclimation for prophylaxis of coccidiosis, which might occur in dog colonies. Fecal samples collected from all dogs prior to study start revealed coccidia for several samples; however, all dogs were in good general health and therefore included in the study. Dogs were housed in a climate controlled room (16° - 20°C) with a day length of 10 hours light and 14 hours darkness and fed a standard commercial diet at recommended rates. Dogs were housed individually from day -3 to the end of the study. All dogs were vaccinated once against Bordetella bronchiseptica and canine parainfluenza virus and twice (5 weeks apart) against canine distemper virus, canine adenovirus 2, canine parvovirus, canine parainfluenza virus and Leptospira interrogans with the second vaccine given 22 days after the first fluralaner treatment/sham dosing. All dogs received praziquantel, pyrantel embonate, and febantel before and 22 days after the first fluralaner treatment/sham dosing for intestinal parasite infection. No clinical findings were observed in any dog in association with the vaccination or deworming.Dogs were randomly allocated into groups using a block randomization procedure. Dogs were separated by gender and ranked in descending order of body weight. If two dogs had the same bodyweights, the dogs were sub-ranked by decreasing microchip number. The top four dogs within each gender formed a block that was randomly allocated to each of the four groups, and the process repeated until 4 male and 4 female dogs were allocated to each group. Three groups received fluralaner at different doses and one group served as sham dosed control.The recommended dose range of fluralaner during routine clinical use is between 25 and 56 mg/kg [ 2 , 4 ]. This study evaluated the oral administration of fluralaner, formulated as a chewable tablet, at up to 1, 3, or 5 times the highest recommended treatment dose, i.e. up to 56 (1X group), 168 (3X group), or 280 (5X group) mg fluralaner/kg body weight. The tablet formulation used was the final commercial formulation intended to be marketed as Bravecto™ [MSD Animal Health, 4], produced under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). Dogs were administered fluralaner three times at 8-week (56 days) intervals on days 0, 56 and 112, with the first dose administered at 8 weeks (54–62 days) of age and 2.0 - 3.6 kg of body weight (Table 1 ). The dogs were weighed before each fluralaner treatment to calculate the appropriate dose. A single whole tablet or a combination of whole tablets, containing 112.5 mg or 250 mg fluralaner, were administered to each dog to deliver a dose as close as possible to the calculated dose (Table 2 ). Following tablet administration, a small amount of water was administered to encourage swallowing. Dogs from the control group were not administered fluralaner and were sham dosed with water on days 0, 56 and 112. On treatment days, dogs of all groups received a portion of their normal daily ration of food approximately 10 to 20 minutes prior to treatment and the remaining portion of the daily ration directly after treatment. Dogs were fed around the time of treatment to ensure high systemic fluralaner exposure, since fluralaner bioavailability is higher in fed dogs [ 5 ].Table 1Study dog body weights and ages at the time of first treatmentParameter",2017/02/02,snopes,0

Most commonly, people get or transmit HIV through sexual behaviors and needle or syringe use.Only certain body fluids—blood, semen (cum), pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum), rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk—from a person who has HIV can transmit HIV. These fluids must come in contact with a mucous membrane or damaged tissue or be directly injected into the bloodstream (from a needle or syringe) for transmission to occur. Mucous membranes are found inside the rectum, vagina, penis, and mouth.In the United States, HIV is spread mainly byHaving anal or vaginal sex with someone who has HIV without using a condom or taking medicines to prevent or treat HIV.For the HIV-negative partner, receptive anal sex (bottoming) is the highest-risk sexual behavior, but you can also get HIV from insertive anal sex (topping).Either partner can get HIV through vaginal sex, though it is less risky for getting HIV than receptive anal sex.Sharing needles or syringes, rinse water, or other equipment (works) used to prepare drugs for injection with someone who has HIV. HIV can live in a used needle up to 42 days depending on temperature and other factors.Less commonly, HIV may be spreadFrom mother to child during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding. Although the risk can be high if a mother is living with HIV and not taking medicine, recommendations to test all pregnant women for HIV and start HIV treatment immediately have lowered the number of babies who are born with HIV.By being stuck with an HIV-contaminated needle or other sharp object. This is a risk mainly for health care workers.In extremely rare cases, HIV has been transmitted byOral sex—putting the mouth on the penis (fellatio), vagina (cunnilingus), or anus (rimming). In general, there’s little to no risk of getting HIV from oral sex. But transmission of HIV, though extremely rare, is theoretically possible if an HIV-positive man ejaculates in his partner’s mouth during oral sex. To learn more about how to lower your risk, see Oral Sex and HIV Risk .Receiving blood transfusions, blood products, or organ/tissue transplants that are contaminated with HIV. This was more common in the early years of HIV, but now the risk is extremely small because of rigorous testing of the US blood supply and donated organs and tissues.Eating food that has been pre-chewed by a person with HIV. The contamination occurs when infected blood from a caregiver’s mouth mixes with food while chewing. The only known cases are among infants.Being bitten by a person with HIV. Each of the very small number of documented cases has involved severe trauma with extensive tissue damage and the presence of blood. There is no risk of transmission if the skin is not broken.Contact between broken skin, wounds, or mucous membranes and HIV-infected blood or blood-contaminated body fluids.Deep, open-mouth kissing if both partners have sores or bleeding gums and blood from the HIV-positive partner gets into the bloodstream of the HIV-negative partner. HIV is not spread through saliva.Learn more about how to protect yourself and get information tailored to meet your needs from CDC’s HIV Risk Reduction Tool (BETA).How well does HIV survive outside the body?HIV does not survive long outside the human body (such as on surfaces), and it cannot reproduce outside a human host. It is not spread byMosquitoes, ticks, or other insects.Saliva, tears, or sweat that is not mixed with the blood of an HIV-positive person.Hugging, shaking hands, sharing toilets, sharing dishes, or closed-mouth or “social” kissing with someone who is HIV-positive.Other sexual activities that don’t involve the exchange of body fluids (for example, touching).Learn more about how to protect yourself and get information tailored to meet your needs from CDC’s HIV Risk Reduction Tool (BETA).Can I get HIV from anal sex?Yes. In fact, anal sex is the riskiest type of sex for getting or transmitting HIV.HIV can be found in certain body fluids—blood, semen (cum), pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum), or rectal fluids—of a person who has HIV. Although receptive anal sex (bottoming) is much riskier for getting HIV than insertive anal sex (topping), it’s possible for either partner—the top or the bottom—to get HIV. The bottom’s risk is very high because the lining of the rectum is thin and may allow HIV to enter the body during anal sex. The top is also at risk because HIV can enter the body through the opening at the tip of the penis (or urethra); the foreskin if the penis isn’t circumcised; or small cuts, scratches, or open sores anywhere on the penis. See the Prevention Q&As for information on how to lower your risk of getting HIV from anal sex.Learn more about how to protect yourself and get information tailored to meet your needs from CDC’s HIV Risk Reduction Tool (BETA).Can I get HIV from vaginal sex?Yes. Either partner can get HIV through vaginal sex, though it is less risky for getting HIV than receptive anal sex.When a woman has vaginal sex with a partner who’s HIV-positive, HIV can enter her body through the mucous membranes that line the vagina and cervix. Most women who get HIV get it from vaginal sex.Men can also get HIV from having vaginal sex with a woman who’s HIV-positive. This is because vaginal fluid and blood can carry HIV. Men get HIV through the opening at the tip of the penis (or urethra); the foreskin if they’re not circumcised; or small cuts, scratches, or open sores anywhere on the penis. See the Prevention Q&As for information on how to lower your risk of getting HIV from vaginal sex.Learn more about how to protect yourself and get information tailored to meet your needs from CDC’s HIV Risk Reduction Tool (BETA).Can I get HIV from oral sex?The chance that an HIV-negative person will get HIV from oral sex with an HIV-positive partner is extremely low.Oral sex involves putting the mouth on the penis (fellatio), vagina (cunnilingus), or anus (anilingus). In general, there’s little to no risk of getting or transmitting HIV through oral sex.Factors that may increase the risk of transmitting HIV through oral sex are ejaculation in the mouth with oral ulcers, bleeding gums, genital sores, and the presence of other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), which may or may not be visible.You can get other STDs from oral sex. And, if you get feces in your mouth during anilingus, you can get hepatitis A and B, parasites like Giardia, and bacteria like Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, and E. coli.For information on how to lower your risk of getting HIV or other STDs from oral sex, see Oral Sex and HIV Risk .Learn more about how to protect yourself and get information tailored to meet your needs from CDC’s HIV Risk Reduction Tool (BETA).Is there a connection between HIV and other sexually transmitted infections?Yes. Having another sexually transmitted disease (STD) can increase the risk of getting or transmitting HIV.If you have another STD, you’re more likely to get or transmit HIV to others. Some of the most common STDs include gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, trichomoniasis, human papillomavirus (HPV), genital herpes, and hepatitis. The only way to know for sure if you have an STD is to get tested. If you’re sexually active, you and your partners should get tested for STDs (including HIV if you’re HIV-negative) regularly, even if you don’t have symptoms.If you are HIV-negative but have an STD, you are about 3 times as likely to get HIV if you have unprotected sex with someone who has HIV. There are two ways that having an STD can increase the likelihood of getting HIV. If the STD causes irritation of the skin (for example, from syphilis, herpes, or human papillomavirus), breaks or sores may make it easier for HIV to enter the body during sexual contact. Even STDs that cause no breaks or open sores (for example, chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis) can increase your risk by causing inflammation that increases the number of cells that can serve as targets for HIV.If you are HIV-positive and also infected with another STD, you are about 3 times as likely as other HIV-infected people to spread HIV through sexual contact. This appears to happen because there is an increased concentration of HIV in the semen and genital fluids of HIV-positive people who also are infected with another STD.For more information about the connection between HIV and other STDs, see STDs and HIV . To get tested for HIV or other STDs, find a testing site near you.Learn more about how to protect yourself and get information tailored to meet your needs from CDC’s HIV Risk Reduction Tool (BETA).Does my HIV-positive partner’s viral load affect my risk of getting HIV?Yes. As an HIV-positive person’s viral load goes down, the chance of transmitting HIV can go down dramatically.Viral load is the amount of HIV in the blood of someone who has HIV. Taking HIV medicine (called antiretroviral therapy or ART) as prescribed can make the viral load very low—so low that a test can’t detect it (called an undetectable viral load). People with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed and get and keep an undetectable viral load have effectively no risk of transmitting HIV to an HIV-negative partner through sex.If you’re HIV-positive, getting into care and taking HIV medicine as prescribed will give you the greatest chance to get and keep an undetectable viral load; live a longer, healthier life; and protect your partners.If you’re HIV-negative and have an HIV-positive partner, encourage your partner to get into care and to take HIV medicine as prescribed.Treatment is a powerful tool for preventing sexual transmission of HIV. But it works only as long as the HIV-positive partner gets and keeps an undetectable viral load. Here are some things to consider when deciding whether treatment as prevention is right for you and your partner:Not everyone taking HIV medicine has an undetectable viral load. Up to one-third of people in HIV care don’t keep an undetectable viral load. To stay undetectable, people with HIV must take HIV medicine every day as prescribed.Missing some doses can increase the viral load and the risk of transmitting HIV. People who have trouble taking medicine as prescribed can talk with their health care provider about the challenges they are facing and develop a plan to ensure they take their medicine every day. They should also consider using other prevention strategies like condoms.We don’t know how often people living with HIV need to have their viral load tested if they are using their undetectable viral load status as their only prevention method. But to stay healthy and protect their partners, they need to visit their provider regularly and get a viral load test as recommended.Some people who take HIV medicine daily can get an undetectable viral load very quickly, but it can take some people up to six months. The only way to know if you are undetectable is by getting your viral load tested.People taking HIV medicine sometimes have small increases or “blips” in their viral load. These blips usually go back down by the next viral load test. But people who experience blips may benefit from using other prevention strategies (condoms) until their viral load is undetectable again.HIV medicine does not protect against other STDs.Both partners should learn about all their options for preventing HIV , as well as other STDs, so they can make the decisions that are best for them.Consider other actions to prevent HIV, like using condoms or a negative partner being on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) , especially if the person with HIVHas trouble regularly taking HIV medicine,Has an increased viral load, or a load of 200 copies/ml of blood or greater,Hasn’t had a recent test (last 6 months) that shows the viral load is undetectable,Missed some doses since the last viral load test, orHas stopped taking HIV medicine in the past and may choose to do so again.Important Note: Consider using condoms if either partner is concerned about getting or transmitting other STDs.Can I get HIV from injecting drugs?Yes. Your risk for getting HIV is very high if you use needles or works (such as cookers, cotton, or water) after someone with HIV has used them.People who inject drugs, hormones, steroids, or silicone can get HIV by sharing needles or syringes and other injection equipment. The needles and equipment may have someone else’s blood in them, and blood can transmit HIV. Likewise, you’re at risk for getting hepatitis B and C if you share needles and works because these infections are also transmitted through blood.Another reason people who inject drugs can get HIV (and other sexually transmitted diseases) is that when people are high, they’re more likely to have risky sex.Stopping injection and other drug use can lower your chances of getting HIV a lot. You may need help to stop or cut down using drugs, but many resources are available. To find a substance abuse treatment center near you, check out the locator tools on SAMHSA.gov or HIV.gov , or call 1-800-662-HELP (4357).If you keep injecting drugs, you can lower your risk for getting HIV by using only new, sterile needles and works each time you inject. Never share needles or works. For more information on how to lower your risk, see How can I prevent getting HIV from drug use?Learn more about how to protect yourself, and get information tailored to meet your needs from CDC’s HIV Risk Reduction Tool (BETA).Download Info Sheet (English and Spanish)Can I get HIV from using other kinds of drugs?When you’re drunk or high, you’re more likely to make decisions that put you at risk for HIV, such as having sex without a condom.Drinking alcohol, particularly binge drinking, and using “club drugs” like Ecstasy, ketamine, GHB, and poppers can alter your judgment, lower your inhibitions, and impair your decisions about sex or other drug use. You may be more likely to have unplanned and unprotected sex, have a harder time using a condom the right way every time you have sex, have more sexual partners, or use other drugs, including injection drugs or meth. Those behaviors can increase your risk of exposure to HIV. If you have HIV, they can also increase your risk of spreading HIV to others. Being drunk or high affects your ability to make safe choices.If you’re going to a party or another place where you know you’ll be drinking or using drugs, you can bring a condom so that you can reduce your risk if you have vaginal or anal sex.Therapy, medicines, and other methods are available to help you stop or cut down on drinking or using drugs. Talk with a counselor, doctor, or other health care provider about options that might be right for you.

This is called HIV superinfection.HIV superinfection is when a person with HIV gets infected with another strain of the virus. The new strain of HIV can replace the original strain or remain along with the original strain.The effects of superinfection differ from person to person. Superinfection may cause some people to get sicker faster because they become infected with a new strain of the virus that is resistant to the medicine (antiretroviral therapy or ART) they’re taking to treat their original infection.Research suggests that a hard-to-treat superinfection is rare. Taking medicine to treat HIV (ART) may reduce someone’s chance of getting a superinfection.Learn more about how to protect yourself, and get information tailored to meet your needs from CDC’s HIV Risk Reduction Tool (BETA).Are health care workers at risk of getting HIV on the job?The risk of health care workers being exposed to HIV on the job (occupational exposure) is very low, especially if they use protective practices and personal protective equipment to prevent HIV and other blood-borne infections. For health care workers on the job, the main risk of HIV transmission is from being stuck with an HIV-contaminated needle or other sharp object. However, even this risk is small. Scientists estimate that the risk of HIV infection from being stuck with a needle used on an HIV-infected person is less than 1%.For more information on preventing occupational exposure to HIV, see Occupational HIV Transmission and Prevention Among Health Care Workers .Learn more about how to protect yourself, and get information tailored to meet your needs from CDC’s HIV Risk Reduction Tool (BETA).Can I get HIV from receiving medical care?Although HIV transmission is possible in health care settings, it is extremely rare.Careful practice of infection control, including universal precautions (using protective practices and personal protective equipment to prevent HIV and other blood-borne infections), protects patients as well as health care providers from possible HIV transmission in medical and dental offices and hospitals.The risk of getting HIV from receiving blood transfusions, blood products, or organ/tissue transplants that are contaminated with HIV is extremely small because of rigorous testing of the US blood supply and donated organs and tissues.It is important to know that you cannot get HIV from donating blood. Blood collection procedures are highly regulated and safe.For more information on preventing occupational exposure to HIV, see Occupational HIV Transmission and Prevention Among Health Care Workers .Learn more about how to protect yourself, and get information tailored to meet your needs from CDC’s HIV Risk Reduction Tool (BETA).Can I get HIV from casual contact (“social kissing,” shaking hands, hugging, using a toilet, drinking from the same glass, or the sneezing and coughing of an infected person)?No. HIV isn’t transmittedBy hugging, shaking hands, sharing toilets, sharing dishes, or closed-mouth or “social” kissing with someone who is HIV-positive.Through saliva, tears, or sweat that is not mixed with the blood of an HIV-positive person.By mosquitoes, ticks or other blood-sucking insects.Through the air.Only certain body fluids—blood, semen (cum), pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum), rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk—from an HIV-infected person can transmit HIV. Most commonly, people get or transmit HIV through sexual behaviors and needle or syringe use. Babies can also get HIV from an HIV-positive mother during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding.

However, it is possible to get HIV from a reused or not properly sterilized tattoo or piercing needle or other equipment, or from contaminated ink.It’s possible to get HIV from tattooing or body piercing if the equipment used for these procedures has someone else’s blood in it or if the ink is shared. The risk of getting HIV this way is very low, but the risk increases when the person doing the procedure is unlicensed, because of the potential for unsanitary practices such as sharing needles or ink. If you get a tattoo or a body piercing, be sure that the person doing the procedure is properly licensed and that they use only new or sterilized needles, ink, and other supplies.Learn more about how to protect yourself, and get information tailored to meet your needs from CDC’s HIV Risk Reduction Tool (BETA).Can I get HIV from being spit on or scratched by an HIV-infected person?No. HIV isn’t spread through saliva, and there is no risk of transmission from scratching because no body fluids are transferred between people.Learn more about how to protect yourself, and get information tailored to meet your needs from CDC’s HIV Risk Reduction Tool (BETA).Can I get HIV from mosquitoes?No. HIV is not transmitted by mosquitoes, ticks, or any other insects.Learn more about how to protect yourself, and get information tailored to meet your needs from CDC’s HIV Risk Reduction Tool (BETA).Can I get HIV from food?You can’t get HIV from consuming food handled by an HIV-infected person. Even if the food contained small amounts of HIV-infected blood or semen, exposure to the air, heat from cooking, and stomach acid would destroy the virus.Though it is very rare, HIV can be spread by eating food that has been pre-chewed by an HIV-infected person. The contamination occurs when infected blood from a caregiver’s mouth mixes with food while chewing. The only known cases are among infants.Learn more about how to protect yourself, and get information tailored to meet your needs from CDC’s HIV Risk Reduction Tool (BETA).Are lesbians or other women who have sex with women at risk for HIV?Case reports of female-to-female transmission of HIV are rare. The well-documented risk of female-to-male transmission shows that vaginal fluids and menstrual blood may contain the virus and that exposure to these fluids through mucous membranes (in the vagina or mouth) could potentially lead to HIV infection.Learn more about how to protect yourself, and get information tailored to meet your needs from CDC’s HIV Risk Reduction Tool (BETA).Is the risk of HIV different for different people?Some groups of people in the United States are more likely to get HIV than others because of many factors, including the status of their sex partners, their risk behaviors, and where they live.When you live in a community where many people have HIV infection, the chances of having sex or sharing needles or other injection equipment with someone who has HIV are higher. You can use CDC’s HIV, STD, hepatitis, and tuberculosis atlas to see the percentage of people with HIV (“prevalence”) in different US communities. Within any community, the prevalence of HIV can vary among different populations.Gay and bisexual men have the largest number of new diagnoses in the United States. Blacks/African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos are disproportionately affected by HIV compared to other racial and ethnic groups. Also, transgender women who have sex with men are among the groups at highest risk for HIV infection, and injection drug users remain at significant risk for getting HIV.Risky behaviors, like having anal or vaginal sex without using a condom or taking medicines to prevent or treat HIV, and sharing needles or syringes play a big role in HIV transmission. Anal sex is the highest-risk sexual behavior. If you don’t have HIV, being a receptive partner (or bottom) for anal sex is the highest-risk sexual activity for getting HIV. If you do have HIV, being the insertive partner (or top) for anal sex is the highest-risk sexual activity for transmitting HIV.But there are more tools available today to prevent HIV than ever before. Choosing less risky sexual behaviors, taking medicines to prevent and treat HIV, and using condoms with lubricants are all highly effective ways to reduce the risk of getting or transmitting HIV.

He was a fan of blues and rock and roll, and with his father's encouragement taught himself to play guitar. When Hendrix was 16, his father bought him his first acoustic guitar, and the next year his first electric guitar—a right-handed Supro Ozark that the natural lefty had to flip upside down to play. Shortly thereafter, he began performing with his band, the Rocking Kings. In 1959, he dropped out of high school and worked odd jobs while continuing to follow his musical aspirations.In 1961, Hendrix followed in his father's footsteps by enlisting in the United States Army. While training as a paratrooper, Hendrix still found time for music, forming a band named the King Kasuals. Hendrix served in the army until 1962, when he was honorably discharged after injuring himself during a parachute jump. After leaving the military, Hendrix began working under the name Jimmy James as a session musician, playing backup for such performers as Little Richard , B.B. King , Sam Cooke and the Isley Brothers. In 1965 he also formed a group of his own called Jimmy James and the Blue Flames, which played gigs around New York City's Greenwich Village neighborhood.Jimi Hendrix ExperienceIn mid-1966, Hendrix met Chas Chandler—bass player of British rock group the Animals—who signed an agreement with Hendrix to become his manager. Chandler convinced Hendrix to go to London, where he joined forces with bassist Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell to form the Jimi Hendrix Experience. While performing in England, Hendrix built up quite a following among the country's rock royalty, with the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Who and Eric Clapton all becoming great admirers of his work. One critic for the British music magazine Melody Maker said that he ""had great stage presence"" and looked at times as if he were playing ""with no hands at all.""Jimi Hendrix Hey JoeReleased in 1967, the Jimi Hendrix Experience's first single, ""Hey Joe,"" was an instant smash in Britain and was soon followed by hits such as ""Purple Haze"" and ""The Wind Cries Mary."" On tour to support his first album, Are You Experienced? (1967), Hendrix delighted audiences with his outrageous guitar playing skills and his innovative, experimental sound. In June 1967 he also won over American music fans with his stunning performance at the Monterey Pop Festival, which ended with Hendrix lighting his guitar on fire.Electric LadylandQuickly becoming a rock superstar, later that year Hendrix scored again with his second album, Axis: Bold as Love (1967). His final album as part of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Electric Ladyland (1968), featured the hit ""All Along the Watchtower,"" which was written by Bob Dylan . The band continued to tour until it split up in 1969.Star-Spangled BannerIn 1969, Hendrix performed at another legendary musical event: the Woodstock Festival. Hendrix, the last performer to appear in the three-day-plus festival, opened his set with a rock rendition of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" that amazed the crowds and demonstrated his considerable talents as a musician. Also an accomplished songwriter and producer by this time, Hendrix had his own recording studio, Electric Lady, in which he worked with different performers to try out new songs and sounds.In late 1969, Hendrix put together a new group, forming Band of Gypsys with his army buddy Billy Cox and drummer Buddy Miles. The band never really took off, however, and Hendrix began working on a new album tentatively named First Rays of the New Rising Sun, with Cox and Mitch Mitchell. Sadly, Hendrix would not live to complete the project.How Did Jimi Hendrix Die?Jimi Hendrix died in London from drug-related complications on September 18, 1970, at the age of 27. He left an indelible mark on the world of rock music and remains popular to this day. As one journalist wrote in the Berkeley Tribe, ""Jimi Hendrix could get more out of an electric guitar than anyone else. He was the ultimate guitar player.""Related Videos",2011/10/01,snopes,0

The handbook of the DAW will be the gold standard of anti-witchery, the 1490 classic the Malleus Maleficarum (The Hammer of Witches). The Department of Anti-Witchcraft is yet another sign Mike Pence is large and in charge when it comes to his belief religious liberty is America’s number one domestic and foreign concern. The Vice President plans that DAW will protect vital Judeo-Christian interests wherever they are threatened. Reports state that there were discussions inside the administration whether to publicly say that the DAW will protect vital US Judeo-Christian interests. However, President Trump stepped in and pointed out that Judeo-Christian interests are American ones. The new federal department is planned to interface with all other federal law agencies (FBI, NSA, ATF, and ZZTop). The Director of DWA will be given powers to train all existing and future agents in the skills needed to combat the Devil and his lickspittles. “The Bible is true and the Devil is real,” stated Vice President Pence’s assistant, Andrew Canard. “What we really need to do is break the cycle where women are introduced to really hot and virile devils.

Donald Trump also requested that photographs be delivered to his office. It appears the First Lady is rather proud of the images: the new White House website lists the cover shoot as one of her greatest achievements. Recently it has become a source of controversy as questions are raised over how Melania secured her US visa. Now you know the back story, scroll down to see the article and images that were originally published in the January 2000 issue of British GQ. Want jet-set chic? Then sex, style and 18-carat gold seat belts are essential. Supermodel Melania [now Mrs Donald Trump] is the launch pad for 14 pages of high living. There was a time when the Mile High Club was a stand-up organisation. The price of entry was a stolen moment in the cramped and hardly seductive surroundings of a 747 loo, and the penalties for being caught were harsh. Which is a shame when you consider the undeniable frission travelling at 30,000 feet adds to any assignation. Now airlines have wised-up, with Virgin Atlantic offering double beds to its Upper Class passengers. But if you're going to get that all-important upgrade, then you're going to have to join the jet set. And there are rules. Enter high-spirited Donald Trump to show us how it's done. The billionaire New York property magnate, Reform Party presidential candidate and proud owner of this custom-fitted 727 (even the seat buckles are 18-carat gold) is an expert in the art of in-flight entertainment. And his personal hostess, 26-year-old Slovenian supermodel Melania Knauss, might just end up as the next First Lady. Flight of fancy? Not if The Donald has his way. Heavyweight political commentators may scoff, but the delectable Miss Knauss is relishing the prospect of a future pressing the flesh on state occasions. ""I will put all my effort into it, and I will support my man,"" she said recently. ""She's popular, she's brilliant, she's a wonderful woman,"" says Trump with uncharacteristic understatement. And who are we to disagree? Not only does she manage to keep a man fabled for his erections (the latest is the Trump World Tower on New York's First Avenue) on the right flight path, but she's also fluent in four languages. Very handy for those summit meetings. ""I'm going to do everything I can do see that regular Americans can fly as high as their wings will take them,"" says Trump. He's got our vote.

I am mourning the passing of an old friend by the name of Common Sense. His obituary reads as follows: CommonSense, aka C.S., lived a long life, but died from heart failure at the brink of the millennium. No one really knows how old he was, his birth records were long ago entangled in miles and miles of bureaucratic red tape. Known affectionately to close friends as Horse Sense and Sound Thinking, he selflessly devoted himself to a life of service in homes, schools, hospitals and offices, helping folks get jobs done without a lot of fanfare, whooping and hollering.Rules and regulations and petty, frivolous lawsuits held no power over C.S. A most reliable sage, he was credited with cultivating the ability to know when to come in out of the rain, the discovery that the early bird gets the worm and how to take the bitter with the sweet.C.S. also developed sound financial policies (don’t spend more than you earn), reliable parenting strategies (the adult is in charge, not the kid) and prudent dietary plans (offset eggs and bacon with a little fiber and orange juice).A veteran of the Industrial Revolution, the Great Depression, the Technological Revolution and the Smoking Crusades, C.S. survived sundry cultural and educational trends including disco, the men’s movement, body piercing, whole language and new math. C.S.’s health began declining in the late 1960s when he became infected with the If-It-Feels-Good, Do-It virus.In the following decades, his waning strength proved no match for the ravages of overbearing federal and state rules and regulations and an oppressive tax code. C.S. was sapped of strength and the will to live as the Ten Commandments became contraband, criminals received better treatment than victims and judges stuck their noses in everything from Boy Scouts to professional baseball and golf.His deterioration accelerated as schools implemented zero-tolerance policies. Reports of 6-year-old boys charged with sexual harassment for kissing classmates, a teen suspended for taking a swig of Scope mouthwash after lunch, girls suspended for possessing Midol and an honor student expelled for having a table knife in her school lunch were more than his heart could endure.As the end neared, doctors say C.S. drifted in and out of logic but was kept informed of developments regarding regulations on low-flow toilets and mandatory air bags. Finally, upon hearing about a government plan to ban inhalers from 14 million asthmatics due to a trace of a pollutant that may be harmful to the environment, C.S. breathed his last.Services will be at Whispering Pines Cemetery. C.S. was preceded in death by his wife, Discretion; one daughter, Responsibility; and one son, Reason. He is survived by two step-brothers, Half-Wit and Dim-Wit.Memorial Contributions may be sent to the Institute for Rational Thought. Farewell, Common Sense. May you rest in peace.This essay, along with tongue-in-cheek biographical sketches of the survivors of Common Sense, is available as a small book. It is an ideal gift for those who have a sense of humor and are not PC. It’s also ideal for those you think lack common sense but you’d rather not tell them yourself.

Such a pardon is unlikely as President Trump encouraged the prosecution of Cheney in the waning days of the 2016 Presidential campaign.Cheney had publicly endorsed Trump for president, but it was not enough to avoid a prosecution under President Trump's revolutionary ""fair and balanced"" justice system. ""Just like Fox News,"" the President quipped.""We focused on jailing Cheney in order to attract Bernie Sanders supporters,"" confided Kellyanne Conway, former Trump campaign manager. ""And it worked. Despite all the mud thrown at us, we were able to rig our own rigged election. There was so much rigging going on, you could hang Christmas lights from it.""Indeed, cries of ""Jail Chey-nee, Jail Chey-nee"" thundered through crowds at Trump rallies and events. ""Hillary Clinton had no response because we threatened her, too,"" explained Conway, who is now President Trump's Surgeon General. ""There were those who complained about our threatening to jail government officials"" said Conway, ""but their pleas fell on deaf ears.""""They didn't realize jailing government officials can cut both ways,"" Conway said pointedly. Five others were convicted along with Cheney, and their sentences were upheld as well.Former President George W. Bush was granted immunity in direct negotiations with President Trump. ""I got a great deal,"" Trump bragged, ""We got Bush's testimony against Cheney, plus he got me Salma Hayek's phone number.""Earlier, Trump campaigned on a ""Lock Her Up' pledge that targeted Secretary Clinton. After the election, though, Trump never prosecuted Clinton, a former friend who attended three of President Trump's four weddings.Clinton was not invited to most recent ceremony when Trump wed First Lady Salma Hayek. ""Not being invited was punishment enough for Hillary and Bill,"" President Trump told People Magazine. ""Bill likes to 'kiss' the bride, you know,"" the President said, making tiny air quotes with his miniature hands.The vote on the Supreme Court was 5-3. The five justices who voted to uphold Cheney's sentence were Sonia Sotomayor and Trump appointees Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Chris Christie and Ivanka Trump. Vladimir Putin did not vote even though he has been confirmed by the Senate because his citizenship application is still pending. Lawyers saw no conflict when a court packed with President Trump appointees approved a conviction urged by Candidate Trump. ""Its what kids do for their dad,"" beamed the President.Cheney, 78, contends all the charges against him are politically motivated. ""Things will change if we ever have a Republican president again,"" Cheney wrote on a note secretly smuggled from solitary confinement. ""Sad.""Prison will only be a minor inconvenience for Cheney. As a result of a 2002 deal in which Cheney sold his soul to the devil in exchange for not being impeached over 9/11, Cheney no longer ages.He hopes to be president, as he puts it, ""Eventually.""",2016/10/23,snopes,1

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/target-transgender-bathroom-policy/,target caved to pressure from president obama and lgbt groups and instituted a store-wide policy allowing transgender employees and shoppers to use the bathroom that matched their gender identity. see example( s ),Mixture,"['bathroom bill', ' bathroom controversies', ' hb2', ' policies', ' target', ' transgender']",https://www.washingtonpost.com/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/04/19/north-carolinas-bathroom-bill-looks-to-be-hurting-pat-mccrorys-political-future/,2016/04/20,"A few weeks after Gov. Pat McCrory made North Carolina the first state in the nation to limit transgender bathroom use, his Democratic opponent has his biggest lead yet in the tight race. Here's the latest from Elon University, which polled registered voters April 10-April 15, right as North Carolina was making national news for the bill -- and the wave of backlash to it. The poll shows Attorney General Roy Cooper (D) with a six-point lead. Even before North Carolina became synonymous with bathroom bills, McCrory's reelection campaign to a second term was setting up to be one of the most competitive in the nation. Up until this point, polling has shown the race neck and neck. A February Elon University poll showed Cooper with a two-point lead in a hypothetical matchup, but well within its margin of error. The six-point lead, in fact, is the largest Cooper has registered in any poll since 2013, according to Real Clear Politics. Back then, a Democratic-leaning pollster showed the same six-point difference. Read one way, the poll suggests what we've posited: That the bathroom controversy has the potential to backfire on McCrory and North Carolina Republicans. At a minimum, it's put a dent in the governor's image; he signed it under the belief it wouldn't cost the state jobs and then watched as PayPal pulled out of a deal there a few weeks later and Bruce Springsteen and Peal Jam cancelled concerts there. Cooper's game plan all along had been to slam McCrory on his job-creation record. So the near-universal big-business backlash to this bill, known as House Bill 2, played right into the attorney general's hands. On the day this poll was released, his team sent out a press release that read: ""$5,661,857: NC’s Lost Tourism Revenue Due to House Bill 2."" McCrory has tried to clarify that businesses can still make their own bathroom policy -- including in a much-maligned executive order that didn't change the actual bill but expanded workplace protections to LGBT state workers. So far, though, it looks like he's been shouting into the wind. The Elon poll also shows McCrory has a 37 percent job approval rating and 49 percent disapproval rating among registered voters, which is his lowest in the survey in two years. But read another way, this is still a very tight race. Factor in the nearly four-point margin of error, and suddenly Cooper's lead doesn't look as strong. The Elon poll also shows that a little less than half of North Carolina residents -- 49 percent -- essentially agree with the bill's premise preventing cities from passing ordinances allowing transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender they associate with (39 percent thought cities should be allowed to pass those ordinances). Plus, 30 percent of registered voters said they didn't know or didn't have an opinion on Cooper, which gives the better-known McCrory an opportunity to help them get to know his opponent -- and not in a good way. The main factor that keeps this race tight is this: McCrory didn't sign the bill on October 1, 2016. He still has seven months to fix his image. And, as one Republican watching the controversy closely pointed out, that's a lifetime in politics, especially since throwing out an incumbent governor is one of the hardest things to do -- bathroom bill or not.",2016/04/19,snopes,3

NohSatire Alert!The following is a leaked transcript of Hillary Clinton’s first speech to Goldman Sachs delivered on 6/04/2013. Two other speeches are also rumored to be in circulation awaiting publication. This is the full transcript. Secretary Clinton received $225,000 for this speech. The speech has not been confirmed or authenticated.CLINTON: Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you very much, Lloyd [Blankfein], and thanks to everyone at Goldman Sachs for welcoming me today. I’m delighted to be back among friends, colleagues, collaborators, supporters, kindred spirits…Let me jump right in. You know, over the past few months, there have been popular concerns about an economy that still isn’t delivering for the majority of Americans. It’s not “delivering” the way that they feel it should, that they feel entitled to. Most Americans that you speak to, speak a populist rhetoric that claims it is stacked for those at the top, that those of you here have it too good.(Laughter)But we know the hopes that the little people have for their future — things like school, job, food, clothing on their backs– all of those little things would not be possible without your leadership and innovation. Since the time of the Medicis, even before, and the financing of the first joint stock companies in the transatlantic slave trade, we know that finance and banking is what makes our capitalist economy not just grow but tick…Previous generations of Americans built this economy and a middle class on a collective illusion: that they do productive work, this creates wealth, and that this builds the economy. We all know how misguided that is. We know that it’s really due to your investing, credit, and economic stewardship, that they have been able to work at all, that they are able to put food on their tables. It’s due to you and other banking, trading, investment houses that we have an economy that works at all. You are why we are a truly 21st century economic power.(Applause)You, Lloyd, and your colleagues, have been instrumental in that. People say you are overpaid or even parasitic, parasites on the economic body, and they quote a long line of seemingly “unethical behavior”. They equate with you everything that is wrong and immoral with Capitalism, they charge that you have acted ruthlessly and unethically, “rigging every major market bubble since the Great Depression”.(Hissing)But I—contrary to populist, hysterical demonizing–firmly believe that what you do is essential and critical: you help allocate our investment, direct our economic development, hedge risks, and create power, policies, and alliances in ways that make our country stronger, richer, more powerful, more innovative, competitive, and yes, more “democratic”. You underwrite our elections and our political process—taking on the huge cost of enabling democratic dialogue at its biggest, broadest capacity. Your tireless work adds true value, and without you, we would still be struggling helplessly against industrial powerhouses in Asia and across the world trying to compete with them on the level of industry, technology, innovation, and hard work, at which they would beat us hands down. It’s your financial innovation, your speculative tools, which allow us new ways of creating value without sweat or struggle, that gives us the competitive advantage. It’s this vision, this technological innovation, this financial wizardry, this is what makes America great and powerful.(Applause)For decades, people have argued that if we give more wealth to those at top by cutting taxes and letting you and other corporations write the own rules, it will trickle down, it will trickle down to everyone else. And it has! My speech here is an example!(Cackles, Waves Check) (Laughter).But seriously, I believe that the work of Goldman Sachs is critical for us, and without you, America would be a faint shadow of its current greatness. Your work in innovating finance, in creating new sources of wealth and investment, your tireless efforts stimulating the creation of new financial instruments, in lobbying politicians, in monopolizing the treasury and cabinet, in setting and binding the parameters of financial regulation that allows fluidity and flexibility in investment and speculation, this allows us to create wealth—almost out of thin air. It’s this alchemy, this genius, this Midas touch—which is one of the most under-appreciated and under-acknowledged contributions in modern economic history.(Applause)It’s fair to say that you have transformed the solid, clunky, friction-laiden trading of traditional commodity speculation into responsive, intelligent, liquid flows, that have vaporized every barrier and transformed into an expansive, responsive, endlessly expanding gas that fills every atom of our productive economic space that generates immeasurable value everywhere it goes, and everything it touches. Who cares that it’s a little chaotic or “unethical”? That it seems tied to every financial scandal and crisis and economic catastrophe in history? Not me. “Creative Destruction” is all part of the game, and you are masters of it.(Applause)Some will say that you are simply parasitic on those who labor at menial physical production—these are people who still subscribe to 18 Century notions of value production–and that you skim off profit without doing anything meaningful or of value. Those people are misguided: we know that if money never sleeps, that’s because you keep it awake! You have—if I may use a metaphor–injected money with caffeine, Adderal, crack, meth, with LSD so that it can dance the crazy dance and grow a crazy thousand psychedelic feet tall in a rainbow minute! Money was a lazy b*tch, until you put it to work! And look how it works! Look how it grows! Materializes out of nowhere!(Waves check again, dances, cackles).Some people have said that it was your irresponsible financial engineering, risk-taking, and profit-seeking, that led to the 2008 crash; that you shorted your own toxic mortgages in the most brazen securities fraud in financial history, dynamiting and imploding the global economy; and that the exorbitant bonuses paid from tax payer money, the financial bailouts, the non-prosecutions created moral hazard, rewarded avarice, incompetence, corruption and vice. You and I know it is nothing of the sort. As leaders, innovators, captains of finance, you will always be subject of the jealous resentment, the petty tantrums of the unwashed masses, the insolvent, the irresponsible, the invidious, the losers. They will envy you, your successes, they will despise you, but they secretly want to be like you!(Laughter)As you know, my husband tried very hard to change the culture of this misbegotten underclass, by kicking them off the government teat, by poisoning their milk with harsh, bitter regulation, and by disciplining them with the most arbitrary, racist, punitive, devastating criminal laws in US history, laws which Richard Nixon, the Southern strategists, the slave catchers, could only have dreamed of. He also passed NAFTA, which told them in no uncertain terms that they needed to discipline themselves as workers, and learn to be competitive in the global sweatshop, or face certain extinction. But they have not learned their lesson.(Hissing)The effects prove themself. Under President Clinton — I like the sound of that!— America saw the longest, most prodigious reaming of the undesirable classes in our history, putting them firmly in their places. And they loved it! He felt their pain! And relished it! Because he was inflicting it!(Applause)And I will too!(Applause)Now today — today, another capitalist crisis looms, bigger and more dangerous than 2008, and again we hear sentimental cries for populist reform. I believe we have to stave off these demands to reform the banking and the financial system, and restructure the economy more equitably. You can’t build an economy without the smart people—the Titans and Gods of Finance—like you–to direct the economy, and for the smart people to do their work, you need to be rewarded for your efforts, and you need a free hand to exercise your brilliance.(Applause)Books like “The Spirit Level” and organizations working for equality, certain politicians, spew a ridiculous myth of populism and the benefits of equality. But the fact is, we can’t create profitable businesses without exploitation, and we can’t grow the economy without speculation and inequality, and we certainly can’t boost our economy into the stratosphere without allowing you to exercise your amazing financial intelligence and acumen in fiscal number-crunching, speculation, numbers-running and fraud!(Applause)Just think of this: can you imagine a football game without gambling? It would be dull, mind-numbing—who would watch steroid-addled jocks rut and slam into each other mindlessly without having put down money on the outcome? Who would pay the huge salaries for these vapid idiots? It’s only because you have bet on the outcome that people become excited about the sport: it becomes life-and-death-thrilling! It becomes paint-your-face-get-shit-faced exciting! Act-stupid-exciting! That’s what you do: you add excitement, thrill, value, and enthusiasm to the dull, dirty job of growing the economy, you make the game exciting, sexy, which draws more money into the game, the casino, that expands the excitement, grows the customer base, develops the economy, and that’s priceless! You speculate, stimulate, titillate, dynamize, satyriasize the entire economy! I am such a fan! Go Goldman Sachs!(Does little cheerleading number, complete with hand gestures)Gooold-Maaan-Sachs!(Applause)Let’s tell the truth: America is struggling—despite the endless fabrication about “the recovery”– because we are not yet running the way we should. Banks are still over regulated. It’s over-regulation that creates financial catastrophe! Despite your huge paychecks and squirreled away assets, I know that you are worried: worried that some “socialist” demagogue might come along and confiscate it all and put you all in jail. With president Obama, you were in good hands: he’s one of us. (Good thing you ponied up $981K for his campaign). He took good care of you, had your back, covered your financial rear. But populist sentiment is rising up again, more strongly than before, and the unwashed masses are full of resentment, anger, jealousy. They are angry that they don’t have jobs, that they are in debt, that they can’t scrape a living together, even though they are working, 2,3,4 jobs to put shelter over their heads. That their children are starving. That they cannot see a light at the end of the tunnel. They are angry about the 100 million people driven into the brink of starvation and the global food riots that they claim you caused with your commodity futures speculation. The $5Trillion of value lost from the markets that they claim you collapsed. The millions who lost their homes and are now on the verge of homelessness. The trillions funneled to you in loans, write-offs, bribes to keep the system going. Even when I was working for Barry (Goldwater), I felt that same irrational resentment. Now it’s at an all time high. Irresponsible single mothers, uneducated immigrants, lead-drinking ghetto-strutters, homeless, crying, babies, starving senior citizens, obnoxious, entitled African Americans who object to having bullets pumped into their bodies by police: all these people are angry, entitled, and making noise, and they are endangering our democracy and economy, our greatness.(Hissing)I hear this everywhere I go. A single mother, with three children—wants to go to college, find enjoyable, well-paid work and also enjoy the emotional luxuries of motherhood—all at the same time. Everyone feels entitled to everything. She even wants housing. Now even I couldn’t do all these things, despite my incredible privilege and intelligence. But they want it all, now. Three children?(Booing)A grandmother, playing with children—it makes her happy like a cow, but she still feels entitled to be paid. Because she wants to feed her drug habit, she wants to sell them for more money….she wants it all!(Booing)A student, with an unmarketable degree in women’s studies, specializing in medieval feminist villanelles, wants debt forgiveness, and a high-paid job putting her non-existent skills analyzing romance language texts to use and profit in a rewarding cause. She also wants a pony, a sensitive but dominant lover, a villa on the Riviera, and World Peace!(Cackles).(Laughter)Millions of working sad-sack Americans have similar fantasies. They want more money. More pay. Decent wages for hard work. They think it grows on trees. They think that money will grow and nuzzle up to them in their sleep, when they have no money-appeal. They think they can tax Other People’s Money to get what they want. They don’t realize Money has to be jacked up the ass, stuck in the veins with meth, dragged out and pimped to make more! You have figured out how to make your money work, turned it into a profit-generating prostitute! The future expected earnings of a profit-generating prostitute! That you’ve shorted! These people, idiots, all of them, they expect money to come to them! Without Scheming! Without reaming others! By working hard and being good! Like puppies and ponies! Like flowers after a downpour! Like the lilies of the valley! Like utopian visions of a drug-addled socialist!(Laughter)Wages need to be kept down, and people just need to work harder. Damn harder. At least as hard as Bill worked to keep Haiti down.(Applause)We must lower incomes for low-value working schmucks, so they give up on any notions of a middle-class life. But more than that, we must reduce the slick, unsustainable bigotry of expectation: the profit-sucking cage of entitlement, expectation, and imagination. We must drive income down steadily and siphon that surplus wealth to you, the captains of finance, so that we can build a strong economy that is innovative, powerful, that acknowledges and rewards your acumen…(Applause)And that will be my mission, from the first day I am president to the last. I…(Applause)I will get up every day thinking about you, the hard-working Wizards of Finance, Lords of Capital, Economic Giants of Innovation, Noble Titans that make us strong and powerful!(Applause)I came from a petit-bourgeois family with a drapery business that exploited workers to give me good middle-class life, a first-class education, and my incorrigibly elitist beliefs. It put me on third base, instead of striking out. As I try to steal home, I will be thinking about all the Wall Street bankers that I represented in New York and the “advice” that they gave me, and I will work with them—for you– to give them the maximum freedom to do what’s best for them. Because what’s best for Wall Street is what’s best for the US. What’s best for Goldman Sachs is what’s best for the planet. I promise to take on this challenge against the clamoring, whining, agitating babies demanding for major changes in our economy and the global economy, demanding for equity and justice. These demands are stupid beyond belief.(Laughter)As you know, advances in financial technology and global trade have created new areas of commercial activity and opened new markets for our exports. Too often policy wonks want to resort to protectionist measures because they don’t realize that these treaties are designed to suck wealth out of the third world and suck it into your portfolios. These people suffer from a lack of big-picture thinking. They believe that they are still going to be building widgets in a factory if it were not for the 1 billion Chinese stealing their jobs. They don’t understand that we are sucking the lifeblood out of both of the Chinese and all workers—the vampire squid with the blood funnel—creating value, wealth, growth!(Cackles)Today’s marketplace focuses on the short-term, instantaneous financial trading, and short-term earnings reports, and that’s just how it should be. Those who are struggling need to rent out their living rooms, garages, bathrooms, dog houses, sell trinkets on EBay, sell themselves, their time and their bodies in the gig economy. All of this creates exciting, dynamic extra wealth, which should go to you, the geniuses of the universe, because you are the ones driving this with your investments, speculations, deregulation, policy capture, and of course outright bribes. There’s no problem that a little more liberalization and deregulation can’t make better!(Takes out check and cackles)But all of these trends are temporary, and artificial, and unless we push really hard to make them happen, they won’t continue. The choices we make as a nation matter. The choices we make will set the stage for what American life will be like in this 21st century: will we have a nation of namby-pamby socialistic commies whining and demanding every little privilege while our nation crashes down around our ears, and we are reduced to becoming serfs for the Chinese? Or will we have a powerful country, bristling with guns and weapons, capable of putting everyone in their place? Capable of invading countries on a whim? Of unleashing chaos and violence gratuitously? Of violating a leader’s body orifices with sharp objects with impunity?(Cackles).Of manipulating the world economy on a dime, without sweating any labor?(Applause)As president, I will work with you to turn the tide of populism, to make these currents of change infeasible, impossible. We don’t hide from change; we subvert, hijack it, appropriate it.(Applause)But it will take money. Lots of it. This is a good start.(Waves check again, smiles, coyly).The measure of our success must be how much incomes rise for you, the elite, the 0.0001%, not some just arbitrary growth targets tethered to people’s unwarranted and undeserved notions of “equity”, and “justice”.(Applause)I want to see our economy work for the top, the leaders, the Gods, the Masters of the Universe like you. We’re not going to find all the answers we need in the playbooks of the past, we can’t go back to the policies of social equity that failed completely…Today is not 1968. The sixties are so over. And it’s not 1917. The Bolshies are so over. It’s not 1789. No more liberty, equality, fraternity. No more freedom fries. Non Merci! ça suffit! People need to accept the fact that finance capital is a reality, that the interests of the capital markets drives the world, that it can’t be turned back, and that it’s the final solution for all the challenges we face now, including the unending catastrophes that it’s creating, including the burning, fiery apocalyptic end of the planet.So today, I’m proposing an agenda to give you what you deserve, an agenda for unlimited financial deregulation, growth, wealth accumulation and concentration. It’s the least we can offer you given the undeserved contempt and abuse you’ve suffered over the past years.More concentration means more jobs and more new businesses catering to you. More jobs give people more opportunities to service you, toady up to you, vampire squid and all.(Waves check suggestively).Full employment is completely unnecessary, so 19th Century; the desperation of potential unemployment keeps people working hard to keep their jobs, so their productivity and toadying should be absolutely top notch! No more disrespect!We know that Finance creates most of the wealth in this country, so that has to be THE top priority.Let me tell you straight: I want to be the presidency of, by, for Goldman Sachs, and I mean it. I’ll make sure to line my cabinet with your people, like everyone else. Lloyd, name your position!(Wild Applause)And throughout the upcoming campaign, I’m going to be sending lots of dog-whistle messages about how to empower you with less red tape, less regulation, less taxes, easier access to free, risk-free money, simplification, easy access to me, all the while talking populist claptrap….(Takes out dog whistle and blows to utter silence)(Loud laughter)Don’t be thrown off by the populist rhetoric. You know that’s just how we play the game. You know I’m your gal…a Goldman Sachs gal….(Brushes check wistfully over lips)(Laughter)Just don’t tell anyone what I said….(Laughter)I’ll push for tax incentives to spur speculation, giving you loopholes that you can drive your jumbo private jet or yacht through! Show us how innovative, creative thinking you are!(Wild applause)And I know it’s not always how we think about this, but another engine of strong growth should be the TPP and the TTIP, and the TISA.(Applause)I want you to hear this. Creating a global neo-liberal enclosure of the entire world economy that pretends to be about “free trade” won’t do much for the total economy—perhaps a tiny percentage point of growth—but I guarantee it will line your pockets like nothing else. Think trillions in your coffers. Quadrillions, once we force all the Asian-Pacific economies to suspend their financial uptightness restricting wild casino gambling! Financial liberalization forced on Asia will result in Quadrillions! Bazillions! And remember, the house—that’s us—we write the rules—never loses!(Wild Applause)These are the new policies that will help change the world order. It’s not just about these United states, or even the Asia-Pacific that I’m pushing for in the Pacific Pivot. We need to change the planet, before the planet changes us, gets back at us for abusing it so deeply. It’s the planetary endgame, and we want to have a big blast before our toys are taken away….When I get started, we get our country moving in the direction that we want. Money that can channel more public and private funds to the top leadership—that’s you and me…(Applause)… channel those funds to finance and speculation!(Applause)So let’s built those faster trading algorithms and make sure they work faster, bigger, riskier, and trade sums larger than they have ever before!(Applause)And really, there’s no excuse not to make wilder, greater investments in speculative trading right now.(Wild applause)Our economy obviously runs on finance, and the time is long overdue to make America the ultimate financial superpower. Weapons of financial mass destruction? Bring them on! They are our weapons! Some may worry Finance may destroy millions of jobs, put billions into penury, kill billions of starvation, send the economy into a crazy tailspin, but it will make us—that’s you and me—rich and powerful beyond imagination. Let’s be real here. Isn’t that what matters?(Cackles)(Laughter)Let’s fund the mathematical research that spawns breathtakingly risky trading algorithms and creates entire new areas of fictitious capital, an equation to model every aspect of human greed and fantasy and desire! I can put my support behind that! A mathematical copula that really copulates the unwashed masses!(Laughter)(Wild Applause)I will set ambitious goals in all of these areas in the months ahead.But today, let me emphasize again, that I will institute the key ingredient of strong growth that often goes overlooked… I will break down all global non-tariff barriers so we can do what we did to our economy all over the world. We are equal opportunity crisis-makers!(Applause)Watch what I do, not what I say!(Lifts dog whistle to lips)(Loud laughter)We are in a global competition, as I’m sure you have noticed.I’m starting to repeat myself, but I’m on a roll.We can’t afford to leave finance on the benches. That’s exactly what we’re doing today with Glass-Steagall-type regulation. When we leave money on the bench, we not only shortchange its power, and we lose the game, and we shortchange our country and our future.The movement of hot, speculative money into real estate during the past 20 years was responsible for trillions funneled into your pockets. But that progress is beginning to stall out.Studies show that nearly this decline is happening because we’re trying to stop real fictitious growth, considering valorizing people over profits. What an absurdity!We should be making it easier for speculative finance to make money and innovate. To develop bubbles and create trillion dollar valuations out of thin air! And to short them at will! This is how we pump up our economy like a hydrogen bomb! Speculators who want to speculate without limit should be able to do so without worrying that they may find themselves inside a federal resort working on their abs and pecs.You know, last year –(Applause)You know, all this speculation adds up. And for you, it’s trillions every day. Now I am well aware that for far too long these practices have been challenged by socialistic demagogues.Well, those days are over.(Applause)Free speculation, and free money, no taxes, and no restrictions, here or anywhere else in the world: this is essential to our competitiveness and our growth and my ego! And I can do this in a way that doesn’t alarm or outrage the unwashed masses! As president, I’ll fight to put you first, just like I have my entire career. Just remember the dog whistle!(Lifts to whistle to lips)(Laughter)Just watch!(Applause)The trader who stands on his feet all day, shrieking his heart out, or the quant who is driving his synapses into overdrive trying to make an unforgiving algorithm match the fluctuations in a chaotically fibrillating market, or the hedge fund manager, who has loses sleep over the global economy, these people do not need regulation! They do not need a lecture! They do not need the planet’s animosity. They need more rewards, for the hard, crucial, essential, brilliant, world-changing work they are doing!(Applause)The truth is the current rules for our economy do not reward financial risk-taking enough. r(Applause)Alongside gutting taxes, it’s time to stand up to efforts across our country to restrict the power of finance, which has been proven again and again to destroy an economy, and make you sad….Socialist demagogues like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have made their names stomping and vilifying you….(Hissing)I will fight back against these mean-spirited, misguided attacks. But I will do with subtlety and finesse and subterfuge! Just like when I was a Goldwater girl! Now I’m a Goldman Sach’s girl!(Rubs check suggestively)(Laughter)In the years leading up to the “crash”, financial firms innovated risk away, but regulators in Washington either could not or would understand this. I was alarmed when they took the punchbowl away.The current President Obama gave you and your colleagues 17 Trillion of free money, and endless zero-rate loans, but he still had to pretend to take you and your colleagues to the woodshed. Dodd-Frank. Sarbanes-Oxley. The return of Glass-Steagall. Other annoying, pesky legislation and regulations. Too many of you are bound and wrapped in red tape: shadow banking, money laundering, hedge funds, high-frequency trading, non- bank financing, interest rate manipulation, all done in the shadows, because of vicious, irrational regulations that marginalize and oppress you.(Hissing)Even when you have already pocketed the gains, and gotten away scott-free, there is social approbation, contempt, and this is painful, this is wrong. I feel your pain! On my watch this will all change. Over the course…(Applause)… over the course of my campaign, I will offer plans to unleash your endless creativity and risk-taking. I will make sure that you will not pay the price of those risks: I want to encourage you to take them. Just as limited liability allowed early capitalism to grow, back-stopping your risks will be my charge and duty. We’ll make sure that Wall Street and stock markets explode in growth for you! Profits for you! We will assume the Risks! For you, the financial innovators! Captains! Lords! Titans! Gods of finance!I will appoint you to every regulatory position of power! Too big to fail is too big not to give control over the entire government!(Applause)I will ensure that no one will ever be prosecuted. Those who shout for decriminalization of drugs fail to understand that decriminalizing financial crime will bring it out of the shadows into the mainstream economy, boosting it into the stratosphere!(Applause)Government has to be smarter, smaller, more focused on supporting speculative investments than the convenient politics of justice, and be a better servant of the private sector. Washington has to be a better steward—servant–of your power! The media has to respect you! Please, let’s get back to making decisions that pay due deference to power and money!(Applause)That’s what I’ll do as president. I will seek out and welcome any good idea that is accompanied by a large check!(Brushes check suggestively against cheek)(Laughter)I confess, maybe it’s just the bean counter in me, but I believe that public service is about planting trees for (slave) labor to harvest, and the vision I’ve laid out here today for strong growth for you, your bonuses rising through the stratosphere again, will help finance get ahead and stay ahead forever!And I’m inviting everyone to please join me to do your part.(Waves check).(Laughter).That’s what great countries do. That’s what our country always has done. We follow the money. It’s not about left, right or center; it’s about the money. We take our orders from money. Yes, we do!I’m running for president to build an America for you, for Global Finance. An America built on Financialized Capital, an America where if you do your part, you will reap the rewards, the rich rewards you deserve…even if the planet collapses in total chaos….(Waves check suggestively)Where we take care of our own….(Laughter)And where we get rid of our enemies….(Nervous laughter)Forever…(More Nervous Laughter)Thank you all. Thank you. I just want to leave you with one more thought. I want every banker, financier, trader, hedge fund manager to reach their God-given potential to rule the universe. Please join me in that mission — let’s do it together!(Applause)Thank you all so much.(Applause)",2016/02/26,snopes,1

Sadly, it's not. Ready for it?""Couples are turning extra IVF embryos into jewelry.""A website unironically named KidSpot says ""Couples are Turning Extra IVF Embryos into Jewelry.""After a six-year IVF journey to receive miracles Lachlan, 4, and 21-month-old twins Charlotte and William, Belinda and Shaun Stafford didn’t know what to do with their remaining embryos. Their babies. Donation wasn’t an option, the annual storage fee was an added financial strain, and disposing of them unimaginable.So when the NSW couple heard about Baby Bee Hummingbirds, an Australian company turning embryos into keepsake jewelley, they jumped at the chance. Now Ms Stafford has all of her babies with her every day – including seven embryos in her heart-shaped pendant worn close to her heart, always.The mom said the financial strain would be too much to keep the embryos alive in perpetuity so the couple considered planting the embryos in a garden. But she said they move too much and she couldn't bear to leave them behind. Hence, the necklace.In quotes that sound like a commercial for jewelry made from embryos, the mother said:“My embryos were my babies - frozen in time.“When we completed our family, it wasn’t in my heart to destroy them.“Now they are forever with me in a beautiful keepsake.”Amy McGlade, founder of Baby Bee Hummingbird, said that while they make thousands of keepsakes that include breast milk over placenta, they've made over 50 pieces of jewelry made of embryos in the past few years. “I don’t believe there is any other business in the world that creates jewellery from human embryos, and I firmly believe that we are pioneering the way in this sacred art, and opening the possibilities to families around the world,” she said.Did she just say ""sacred art?"" Make. It. Stop. The more I read the more horrified I became. But wait, it gets worse. According to the group's Facebook page, they're running a sale!The families we craft for are truly aware of the various world wide options for Embryos in storage. They are informed, educated & loving people who have made an educated decision. • • • • • • We are absolute experts & true original leaders in Embryo Ashes • DNA Jewellery. This is an exclusive concept unique Baby Bee Hummingbirds. We are working with a number of local & international fertility clinics to raise awareness of this option for families.The next step in to create educational tools & information packs suitable reflective of this exclusive art. We are therefore offering 15% off all Embryo Ashes Jewellery. We hope this will make the process more affordable & easier on families. It is our wish that we can have these pieces professionally photographed & used for our resources.EMBRYO15 This is the code. It only applies to pieces crafted with Embryos & will help raise much needed awareness.Here's a rule of thumb. Any time someone talks about ""extra"" humans, take a step back. (Yes Bill Nye, you too.)When I consider where we are as a culture and how confused we are, in the end it really is so simple. Do we believe God created each and every human being? Do we believe life is sacred? Not just important. Sacred. Priceless. (And fyi, priceless means you can't run a sale on it.)I understand the sorrow of failed pregnancies. The pain of the family featured in that article is real. I have held in my hands my own stillborn child. My heart breaks for those with failed pregnancies or those unable to have children.I know of a family that after several failed pregnancies opted for IVF and they now have a wonderful baby girl whom they adore. But now the mother is unable to carry children due to complications and they have these ""extra"" embryos frozen. They don't know what to do about them. Unfreeze them? Let them die? Keep them frozen? Heartbreaking decisions. I'm sure those who contact the company selling embryo necklaces are truly seeking solace. But healing comes from Christ, not a keepsake.There are no good solutions in cases like these for what to do with frozen embryos. Even when one of those solutions is on sale.View Comments",2017/05/04,snopes,1

Along the way, certain questions haunted her. “I’ve always wondered what people knew. When did they know it? How did they know it?” said Hoffman, 65. Her mother had been a teenager in Boston during the war but had not paid much attention to the persecution of Jews in Europe at the time, and Hoffman was curious to know how aware her mother and others in the United States would have been. So a couple of months ago, when she saw a newspaper ad about a new project encouraging “citizen historians” to investigate American newspapers’ accounts of Holocaust, she dived in. The project, History Unfolded, is an initiative of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, which is using crowdsourcing to scour newspapers across the country for articles that ran between 1933 and 1945 on the plight of Europe’s Jews. As it turns out, there were a lot of them. Since the project was launched in full in February, the museum has received 1,030 submissions from articles published in 46 states and the District. Although historians have studied the U.S. media’s take on the Holocaust, much of the investigation was done before the Internet and crowdsourcing widened the range of what was possible. “Nobody has done this research, looking at so many papers in the 1930s and ’40s and seeing what the average American citizen would have been reading,” said Elissa Frankle, the museum’s digital projects coordinator. The museum selected 20 events related to the Holocaust in general or in relation to the United States’ involvement — for example, the opening of the Dachau concentration camp in 1933, the failure of a child refugee bill in the U.S. Congress in 1939, and Charles Lindbergh’s 1941 speech accusing President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the British and Jews of pushing the country toward war. An exhibit planned for spring 2018 will incorporate the project’s findings, which will remain available online for researchers. By then the museum hopes to have material from 50 percent of the newspapers that were in circulation in 1940 and engage a fifth of the nation’s high school history classes — around 240,000 students. “It helps teach young people that history is not just memorizing facts and dates,” said Aleisa Fishman, a historian at the museum. Jennifer Goss, a high school history teacher in Staunton, Va., said her students immediately took to the quaint format. “They thought it was so neat to go to the library and use microfilm,” she said. They were also excited to see their community against the backdrop of major historical events. Their local paper, Staunton News Leader, had reported on nearby German POW camps, and the students spoke with people who remembered seeing German officers doing work around town. “They don’t feel like Staunton’s a hub of world affairs, so they thought it was interesting that the government would have chosen to put those camps there,” Goss said. Perhaps because they live in an age of unremitting information, her students overestimated how much material would be available. “Looking at it from a present-day lens, they’re like, ‘Oh, this is so important,’ ” she said. But others were shocked to see how much news had been printed on the Holocaust. “My prevailing notion about this period in time was that a lot of what had happened with the Nazis during the ’30s and ’40s was not that well-known,” said Sandi Auerbach, 62, a retired IBM financial manager in Somers, N.Y., who is a member of the museum and has contributed more than two dozen articles to the project. “I am amazed, quite frankly, at the coverage that there was in a lot of different papers,” Auerbach said. “For example, in 1933 there was a huge rally in Madison Square Garden with 20,000 people in attendance to protest the persecution of Jews in Germany. . . . Tayte Patton, 17, whose English class in Lexington, Ky., is participating, said he was shocked at the United States’ inaction. “I never knew that we didn’t want to let Jews into the country,” he said. The research includes dailies and weeklies, African American newspapers, college papers, and U.S. papers in Yiddish, Spanish and other languages. Holocaust-related news sometimes made the front page, but small publications often printed it inside the paper. However, a local connection might cause a paper to run a story more prominently. For example, when the SS Quanza, carrying hundreds of Jewish refugees from Portugal, was denied entry to Mexico in 1940 and docked in Norfolk for supplies, the Virginian-Pilot covered it. (The stranded travelers were eventually issued U.S. Contributors say they have been struck by detailed accounts of the Nazis’ persecution and slaughter of Jews, along with a wide range of American opinions on whether to act on it. But not all Americans got a chance to read what was in the papers, Frankle said, describing her conversations with people who were alive at the time. “They were saying, ‘Who had the ability to buy a paper? Even circulation figures do not tell the whole story, as family members and neighbors might have passed a single newspaper around. Alex Adams, 72, a retired computer software developer in Marlton, N.J., who volunteers once a month at the museum, has focused on small papers from Montana, where he grew up in a town called Big Timber. “There are dozens that don’t have anything,” he said, noting that front-page stories tended to focus on “wheat prices and fights over right of way on their property and Fourth of July picnics and such.” But in three papers he has found stories on subjects such as boycotts of Jewish businesses and discussions about what to do with the Jews. Even coming up empty-handed is a contribution, showing that readers of certain papers would have had less exposure to what was happening, said David Klevan, the museum’s educational outreach specialist. Deborah Lipstadt, an Emory University history professor and museum board member who wrote “Beyond Belief: The American Press and the Coming of the Holocaust, 1933-1945,” applauded the idea of engaging non-specialists to do history research. “What could be better for a high school student than saying, ‘I’m not just doing a research project; what I’m finding could have implications [for] what’s being presented at the Holocaust Museum,” she said. Several contributors noted a clear connection between the events of the 1930s and ’40s and current affairs. “These things that we’re hearing, with people against immigration and congressmen standing up and speaking against it, it’s exactly the arguments that we’re hearing now, and that’s been astonishing to read,” said Hoffman, who is also a volunteer at the museum and has been focusing on the Free Lance-Star in Fredericksburg, Va. Goss said her students echoed that thought. “Especially since we got to this project right around the time of the Syrian refugee crisis, they drew tremendous connections,” she said.",2016/04/12,snopes,0

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/black-dot-campaign/,victims of domestic violence can effectively send out a secret signal for help by drawing black dots on their palms. see example( s ),Mixture,"['black dot', ' black dot campaign', ' domestic abuse', ' domestic violence', ' victims']",http://www.projectsanctuary.org/,http://www.projectsanctuary.org/about-us/in-the-news/the-black-dot-project-sanctuary-cited-in-internet-domestic-violence-awareness-campaign/,2015/09/14,"Project Sanctuary » About Us » In The News » The Black Dot: Project Sanctuary cited in Internet domestic violence awareness campaignThe Black Dot: Project Sanctuary cited in Internet domestic violence awareness campaignLast week, a well-intentioned Internet campaign swept through Facebook and other social media platforms, going viral in a matter of hours and garnering millions of hits.The “Black Dot” Campaign was founded as a way for victims of domestic abuse to silently signal another person – perhaps a family member or friend –that they are being abused.The signal consisted of drawing a small black dot on their hand and “flashing” the dot to someone who might be able to provide help. Photos of supporters displayed their hands sporting black dots, standing up for domestic violence victims.Though the Internet campaign was shared by millions – even supported by the likes of television personality Dr. Drew Pinsky, not everyone in the domestic violence community was convinced of the merits of this campaign.Like many others who work with domestic violence victims, Dina Polkinghorne, executive director of Project Sanctuary, weighed in on the project. What she didn’t expect was her comments spreading throughout the Internet, posting not only on Facebook, but reaching BuzzFeed – the massive news and entertainment site.Project Sanctuary was one of several agencies that addressed concerns about the campaign, honoring the intentions of the campaign organizers but suggesting that there are other, better, safer ways for domestic violence victims to reach out.In addition to the Ukiah Daily Journal, Polkinghorne was contacted by a London radio station for an interview. “We had no idea that our comments had gone viral until you contacted us,” Polkinghorne noted.Her comments, as well as the comments of other agencies and domestic violence victims sparked a second wave of interest in the campaign.“The Black Dot campaign is a very well-meaning idea, but a bad idea nonetheless. I believe that the woman who started the campaign is a survivor herself. The campaign is spurring conversations but there are better ways to go,” she explains. On its Twitter feed, Project Sanctuary explained that victims could be putting themselves at risk by drawing something on themselves that their abuser could see. “Another issue with the campaign is that not everyone you flash the black dot to is connected to social media,” she continues.“The campaign is getting a lot of attention, so abusers may also be aware of it. They might question why their partner would have the dot on their hand. A well-meaning family member could also see the dot, and inadvertently compound the violence,” she explains.“The Black Dot was a way to silently tell someone that you are in a domestic violence situation, but when would it be appropriate to use it? At the grocery store? At the doctor’s office? Someone who was being completely controlled would be told by the abuser that they want to be in the exam room, so the victim would not be able to tell their doctor that they were in a domestic violence situation.“Most medical professionals are highly trained to look for cues that might suggest someone was being abused. They would ask the alleged abuser to leave the room to have a confidential conversation, and the black dot would not be necessary.”Polkinghorne suggests that there are many ways for concerned friends and family to help a person whom they suspect might be in an abusive relationship.“If you’re a domestic violence victim and you are alone with a friend, you have an opportunity to say something to them,” Polkinghorne explains. “There are many options available.”“If someone suspects that a friend or family member are being abused, they can call Project Sanctuary. Because services are confidential, people sometimes think that they can’t call us and just talk. All staff have signed confidentiality agreements. We don’t even discuss cases among staff in order to protect the confidentiality of our clients. If people are concerned about local confidentiality, they can call any domestic violence agency or hotline.”In these conversations, says Polkinghorne, staff help the caller assess the problem and what friends and family can do to help. “We receive many calls from mothers who are concerned about their daughters or grandchildren. We discuss the red flags with them and suggest ways to help.”There are many “silent pleas for help,” says Polkinghorne, which, if observed can help caring family members provide support.“General warning signs include a person seeming overly afraid or anxious to please their partner, and going along with everything their partner says or does. Do they seem to check in too often with their partner? Do they constantly have to report their whereabouts and what they’re doing?”Other warning signs include receiving frequent, harassing phone calls from a partner, insufficient excuses for bruises and injuries, or missing school, work or social occasions. “If she’s wearing turtlenecks or other inappropriate clothing in the summer or if she wears sunglasses indoors, she could be covering up bruises or other injuries.”Another concern is if the victim seems to be restricted from socializing with family or friends, if the frequency of socialization has changed dramatically or if the victim rarely goes out without their partner. Limited access to money, cars or credit cards can indicate control issues. “More serious signs include the person appearing depressed, anxious or suicidal, or if their self-esteem has plummeted.”Often, those in abusive relationships are the last to see the warning signs for themselves, Polkinghorne explains.“Do you feel anxious around your partner? Do you try to please him or her to avoid being hurt or to ‘keep the peace?’ Are you criticized in front of others? Are you blamed for everything? Are you expected to report your whereabouts at all times? Are you threatened with harm or violence?”Sexual and physical abuse is probably the most blatant form of abuse. “Physical and sexual abusers threaten to kill you or your children. They force partners to have sex, purposefully make sexual activities painful, hit, push, hold partners down or cause others physical harm,” says Polkinghorne.But all abuse isn’t physical. Polkinghorne stresses that emotional abuse is far more insidious than physical abuse. “I can’t tell you the number of emotionally abused victims who say, ‘I wish he would have just hit me, because then it would have been over.’” The scars from emotional abuse are long-lasting and difficult to overcome.Abusive partners frequently switch between kind and hurtful behavior. They control the finances and make the majority of relationship decisions. They make you wait all the time and make you feel like something is wrong with you for being upset. They are jealous for no reason, make you feel powerless and minimize their abusive comments or behavior.”“If you suspect abuse, ask your friend or family member if something is wrong. Express your concern. Listen and offer your personal or professional help. Support your friend’s decisions and get information for yourself so you can be the best possible advocate.”Polkinghorne says creating a safety plan is one way that family and friends can help the abused person to begin an exit strategy. “It’s very scary to think about leaving an abusive relationship. Statistics bear out that the most dangerous time for people in domestic violence situations is when they leave the relationship. People ask us, ‘Why don’t people just leave the relationship?’ When the abuser holds the credit, the money, the keys, when the abuser’s name is on the lease and the victim has no job and their family lives in New York, what are their options? This is why a safety plan is important. Save money and ask a family member or a friend to hold it for you. Keep copies of important documents. Seek professional help and stay in contact with a trusted friend.”October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month. “Though the Black Dot Campaign may not be the perfect answer to help victims of domestic abuse, there is so much people can do to support their loved ones and help them find a way to a better life,” Polkinghorne concludes.For more information, visit Project Sanctuary on Facebook, on Twitter @p_sanctuary and online at http://www.projectsanctuary.org.",2015/10/09,snopes,1

Michael Cohen, the executive vice president of the Trump Organization and special counsel to Donald Trump, made this accusation while answering questions about Trump’s donations to veterans’ groups. He blamed the news media for asking questions about Trump’s donations, yet letting Hillary Clinton’s allegedly squandered hospital promise go unquestioned. Although Cohen made the comment in passing, it was picked up by Diamond and Silk, a pro-Trump duo with a Twitter following of more than 80,600. .@HillaryClinton foundation raised $100 Mill 2 build a hospital N Haiti but D hospital was never built. .@HillaryClinton foundation raised $100 Mill 2 build a hospital N Haiti but D hospital was never built. We reached out to Cohen directly and through the Trump Organization and Trump campaign several times, but he didn’t respond to our request for a source for his claim. So we dug around to see if there were any facts to support it. The Clintons played a major role in recovery efforts in Haiti after the devastating earthquake in 2010. Former president Bill Clinton was the public face of U.S. efforts in Haiti through several recovery roles. He was the United Nations special envoy to Haiti, co-leader of the Clinton-Bush Haiti Fund (with former president George W. Bush) and co-chairman of the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission, a quasi-government planning body that approved hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. government-funded recovery projects. The U.S. Agency for International Development supported the commission’s efforts, and Hillary Clinton led the U.S. response in Haiti as secretary of state. The Clinton Foundation raised more than $30 million for Haiti relief projects. The Clinton family’s charitable work in Haiti has been a mix of success, disappointment and controversy. As our Washington Post colleagues reported, some Clinton-backed projects didn’t come through, such as a $2 million housing expo for thousands of new housing units. The Government Accountability Office found poor planning and unsustainable outcomes for taxpayer-funded projects through USAID, such as a $170 million power plant and port for the Caracol Industrial Park, which the Clinton Foundation promoted. Hillary Clinton’s younger brother had connections to a mining project in Haiti, raising suspicions among Haitians about the Clintons’ motives. Luxury hotel projects paid by the Clinton-Bush Haiti Fund promised construction jobs — but for Haitians, it represented another disconnect between Clinton-backed efforts and the realities of one of the poorest countries struggling to rebuild after one of the worst humanitarian disasters in the Western Hemisphere. There’s real frustration among Haitians over failures in progress promised to them, not just by the Clintons but from the international community at large. In 2015, Haitian activists protested outside the Clinton Foundation in New York, claiming the Clintons mismanaged hundreds of millions in taxpayer money through the Interim Haiti Reconstruction Commission. But there is no evidence that Hillary Clinton, through the Clinton Foundation, raised “hundreds of millions of dollars” for a hospital that was never built. We consulted groups that have been critical of recovery delays in Haiti, but they could not point to a specific Clinton Foundation-funded hospital project, either. “We’ve tried to figure out what he might be citing as well, but we can’t provide you with a source of his claim because one doesn’t exist,” said Craig Minassian, a Clinton Foundation spokesman. “The Clinton Foundation never committed to build a hospital, nor did it accept, raise, or spend funds for that purpose. There are hospital projects that have been delayed, but there’s no evidence that there were “hundreds of millions of dollars” in foundation money promised to those efforts. For example, the USAID inspector general found delays in the $99 million reconstruction of medical facilities and medical supply warehouses through the Health Infrastructure Program. This program included the $82.3 million construction of the country’s key public hospital, the Hospital of the State University of Haiti in Port-au-Prince, one of the first projects that the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission approved. But the project is backed by money from the U.S. government, Haiti and France — not the Clinton Foundation. Another major hospital project was the University Hospital in Mirebalais, run by Partners in Health, a group that has worked on recovery efforts with the Clinton Foundation. This hospital opened in 2013, and Partners in Health confirmed that no donation of “hundreds of millions of dollars” was committed by the Clinton Foundation for the project. The Clinton Foundation helped provide solar panels at Hospital Bernard Mevs in Port-au-Prince, a trauma center. But Minassian said the foundation did not commit hundreds of millions of dollars for construction of a new facility. Perhaps Cohen was referring to the $500 million in “commitments to action” that the Clinton Foundation announced would be used for projects in Haiti. The commitments were secured from private businesses through the Clinton Global Initiative. The commitments are public pledges that companies made at a Clinton Global Initiative conference, promising to do good in the world. The Clinton Global Initiative tracks progress of the commitments but is not responsible for their implementation. There’s a lot of criticism lodged against the Clintons for their involvement with recovery efforts in Haiti. But Cohen’s claim that Hillary Clinton raised hundreds of millions of dollars through the Clinton Foundation for a hospital that was never delivered is not credible. There is, indeed, a major public hospital in Port-au-Prince that has been delayed, even though it was one of the first projects approved by the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission. The commission was co-chaired by Bill Clinton, who became the face of many recovery efforts in Haiti. Cohen can blame Bill Clinton’s leadership on the commission, or the managing of taxpayer money for this project. But that claim is entirely different from the one Cohen made. Perhaps Cohen was referring to the $500 million in “commitments to action” for Haiti initiatives announced by the Clinton Foundation. But not all of the commitments were relating to health care or building a hospital, and the commitments don’t involve Clinton Foundation money. We’ve done our part to check out his claim, but the burden of proof still lies with Cohen. If he wants to respond and point us to a specific source, we’re eager to take a look. In the meantime, he earns Four Pinocchios.",2016/06/13,snopes,0

The style is personal preference, and people who keep their hair long are viewed as hippies, hipsters, or just plain lazy. However, a whole different story emerged during the time of the Vietnam war.A woman, lets call her Sally, was married to a licensed psychologist who happened to work at a VA Medical Hospital. He worked with combat veterans who were suffering from PTSD.Below is Sallys story:I remember clearly an evening when my husband came back to our apartment on Doctors Circle carrying a thick official looking folder in his hands. Inside were hundreds of pages of certain studies commissioned by the government. He was in shock from the contents. What he read in those documents completely changed his life. From that moment on my conservative middle of the road husband grew his hair and beard and never cut them again. What is more, the VA Medical center let him do it, and other very conservative men in the staff followed his example. As I read the documents, I learned why.It seems that during the Vietnam War special forces in the war department had sent undercover experts to comb American Native American Reservations looking for talented scouts, for tough young men trained to move stealthily through rough terrain. They were especially looking for men with outstanding, almost supernatural, tracking abilities. Before being approached, these carefully selected men were extensively documented as experts in tracking and survival.With the usual enticements, the well proven smooth phrases used to enroll new recruits, some of these Native American trackers were then enlisted. Once enlisted, an amazing thing happened. Whatever talents and skills they had possessed on the reservation seemed to disappear mysteriously, as recruit after recruit failed to perform as expected in the field.Serious casualties and failures of performance led the government to contract expensive testing of these recruits, and this is what was found.When questioned about their failure to perform as expected, the older recruits replied consistently that when they received their required military haircuts, they could no longer sense the enemy. They could no longer access a sixth sense, their intuition no longer was reliable, they could not read subtle signs as well or access subtle extrasensory information.So the testing institute recruited more Native American trackers, let them keep their long hair, and tested them in multiple areas. Then they would pair two men together who had received the same scores on all the tests. They would let one man in the pair keep his hair long, and gave the other man a military haircut. Then the two men retook the tests.Time after time the man with long hair kept making high scores. Time after time, the man with the short hair failed the tests in which he had previously scored high scores.Here is a standardized test:The recruit is sleeping out in the woods. An armed enemy approaches the sleeping man. The long haired man is awakened out of his sleep by a strong sense of danger and gets away long before the enemy is close, long before any sounds from the approaching enemy are audible.In another version of this test, the long haired man senses an approach and somehow intuits that the enemy will perform a physical attack. He follows his sixth sense and stays still, pretending to be sleeping, but quickly grabs the attacker and kills him as the attacker reaches down to strangle him.This same man, after having passed these and other tests, then received a military haircut and consistently failed these tests and many other tests that he had previously passed.So, the document recommended that all Native American trackers be exempt from military haircuts. In fact, it required that trackers keep their hair long.How is this possible? It all has to do with how we as humans have evolved. Every part of the body has a purpose, and when we lose touch with ourselves and our bodies, we lose the true power we have.Hair, like skin, is an extension of the nervous system, it may be correctly seen as exteriorized nerves, a type of highly evolved feelers or antennae that transmit vast amounts of important information to the brainstem, the limbic system, and the neocortex.However, many people think hair is dead and does nothing for us as humans. It is just an accessory. I do not know who is right or who is wrong, but I am open to all possibilities.Here is the man you need to hear it from:This article was featured at Rense & WakingTimes by C.

When pressed for specifics, the GOP frontrunner dismissively quipped, “Well, I think we spend way too much on organizations and departments that just ‘save’ stuff. For instance, I’d make a move to get rid of the Library of Congress. ”Trump continued, “Y’know what? Old books, decomposing newspapers, pansy artwork and a bunch of black and white movies about women and illegal immigrants have no business being “protected” with our hard-earned tax dollars. My first act as President would be to dissolve wasteful branches of government like the Library and that Kennedy Center for Peforming Arts stuff, and sell the material to China for huge profits.”The statement caused a surprisingly quick response from Acting Librarian of Congress David S. Mao. Having just been named to the position by retired Congressional Librarian James H. Billington this past October, Mao did not foresee such inflammatory attention being brought to his doorstep so quickly, “The threat of dissolution of the Library of Congress is unprecedented,” Mao stated in a missive sent to AP. “It’s not within the scope of the Presidency to deny such funding.”David S. Mao, Acting Librarian of CongressMao went on to define the depth and breadth, and impact such a cavalier undertaking could mean. “We are the largest library in the world, with over 162 million items. Books, films, photographs, audio recordings, maps and manuscripts, our collection is unprecedented. To lose these vital touchstones to all of civilization would be catastrophic.”When asked to respond, Trump’s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, issued this statement: “The President of the United States appoints the Librarian of Congress and can just as easily “unappoint”him. Mr. Mao should be more concerned with his ancestry, which sounds a little Communistic, if anything.” CNN’s Anderson Cooper attempted to reach Lewandowski live on air following the statement, but was informed the campaign manager is currently focused on his arrest for battery against a female reporter.As expected, the statement caused shockwaves across social media. Martin Scorsese, proponent for film preservation, immediately tweeted: “Inconceivable. Drumpf (referring to Trump’s real name) will destroy the United States of America as he dismantles our heritage.”Casablanca, 1942, starring Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, could be destroyedAt press time, UCLA Film and Television Archives, AFI, The Paley Center for Media and the Hubbard Celebrity Centre International all chimed in with vows to step in and archive as many of the films involved as possible. Dr. Jan-Christopher Horak, UCLA Film and Television Archive Director issued this statement: “Edison Kinetoscopes, Citizen Kane, To Kill a Mockingbird, Lawrence of Arabia, I could go on and on. These are our International life’s blood. And that’s just the films. Only one of three known Gutenberg Bibles are housed in the Library of Congress. Mr. Trump is actually heralding the Apocalypse.”Surprisingly , there were voices of support. When questioned, the Cruz Campaign commented, “We’re not ready to comment, however, the country needs to make some tough decisions, and the Library of Congress does fit the criteria of wasteful spending.”The recently released “Rosa Parks Papers,” could potentially be on the “burn list”Attempting to return to the spotlight, Sarah Palin tweeted: “To Kill a Mockingbird? Isn’t that a racist, Klu Kux Klannigan movie to begin with?”Lou Lumenick , Entertainment Columnist for the New York post responded, “The entire movie industry has successfully transitioned to digital. There really is no reason to store so many prints of film.” He went on to observe, “Batman v Superman was shot, edited and shown without any film footprint at all. And that really is the apogee of moviemaking.”We will continue to update this story as more information reaches us.Over 700,000 rare books, including the recently acquired Thomas Jefferson library, could be sold to China, under Trump’s planShare this:",2016/04/01,snopes,1

So, according to the article, solar panels don’t just capture the Sun’s energy but actually physically drain it of energy. This, according to the article, could cause a man-made disaster unfathomable by most. A quote from the article: “If every home in the world had solar panels on their roofs, global temperatures would drop by as much as thirty degrees over 20 years, and the Sun could die out within three hundred to four hundred years.” Again, National Report is a satirical website.Solar panels are not like a vacuum cleaner- they can’t physically suck out the Sun’s energy. The Sun consistently emits solar radiation, regardless of whether we use it or not. It isn’t a feedback system whereby our actions can alter the amount released. It’s a system that we tap into for our benefit; we have no influence over it.Just to give you an idea of how little energy we use compared to what is produced, the Sun puts out 3.8 x 1026 Watts , or Joules per second. The Earth’s population consumes around 15 terawatts of power (one terawatt is 1012 Watts, so this would be 1.5 x 1013 in total). So that’s 380,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 compared with 15,000,000,000,000. But that is still irrelevant because we don’t physically drain it anyway. The Sun is a finite source of energy; it will burn out one day, but that’s not going to happen for a very, very long time ( 5 or so billion years ). So don’t get your knickers in a twist just yet - we’ll be fine.",2014/05/27,snopes,3

Scottish photographer Alan McFadyen would know: he spent an estimated 6 years, 4,200 hours, and 720,000 exposures trying to nail the perfect symmetrical shot of a kingfisher diving into its reflection.McFadyen spent most of his career as a fisherman before a nasty back injury forced him to pick up a camera instead. He has been doing wildlife photography since 2009.Growing up, McFadyen used to visit a lake with his late grandfather to watch a kingfisher nesting spot. After taking up photography, McFadyen decided to honor his grandfather by capturing the perfect photo of a kingfisher.So, he began visiting a lake a few times a week, taking pictures an average of 100 days a year, waiting for an opportunity to capture a kingfisher mid-dive at the surface of the water — and capturing beautiful photos of many other birds over the years .“Kingfishers dive so fast they are like bullets so taking a good photo requires a lot of luck – and a lot of patience,” McFadyen tells the Daily Mail . He also says that female kingfishers only dive a handful of times per day, so the shot is hard to predict.Finally, last month, everything came together. A bird did a perfect dive, and McFadyen finally managed to capture a shot in which the tip of the kingfisher’s beak is touching the surface of the lake:The countless hours spent outdoors was also a way for McFadyen to test his photography hides for bird photographers. McFadyen is the owner of Scottish Photography Hides , which rents out hides for £80 a day.

During a rally in Huntsville, Alabama on Friday, the president made it clear where he stands on player protests. Trump said he would love to see NFL owners cut any player who protests by kneeling during the national anthem. ""Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now,"" Trump said to a cheering crowd . ""Out. He's fired. He's fired.""As the crowd began to chant ""U-S-A"" to Trump, the president made sure to mention that he's friends with ""many"" NFL owners and he also made sure to mention that the first owner to cut a protesting player would instantly become the most popular person in the country. ""You know, some owner is going to do that, he's going to say, 'That guy that disrespects our flag, he's fired,'"" Trump said. ""And that owner, they don't know it -- they're friends of mine, many of them -- they don't know it, they'll be the most popular person for a week, they'll be the most popular person in this country, because that's a total disrespect of our heritage, that's a total disrespect of everything that we stand for.""Trump does have some support among the NFL ownership. There were at least seven owners who donated a million dollars each to his inauguration fund. That list of owners includes : Robert Kraft (Patriots), Jerry Jones (Cowboys), Woody Johnson (Jets), Stan Kroenke (Rams), Dan Snyder (Redskins), Shahid Khan (Jaguars), and Bob McNair (Texans).As for protesters, Colin Kaepernick became the first player to protest when he sat for the anthem during a preseason game in August 2016. Kaepernick's protest started a movement where players began to kneel as a way to protest racial injustice and police brutality. Colin Kaepenrick started a movement in 2016. USATSIBack in August 2016, Trump said that Kaepernick should find a new country to live in if he didn't want to stand for the national anthem. Thirteen months into the protests, Trump said that the players kneeling is likely the second biggest reason that the NFL's TV ratings are down. Of course, the No. 1 reason why ratings are down is because of Trump, according to Trump. ""I know we have freedoms and we have freedom of choice and many many different freedoms, but you know what, it's still totally disrespectful,"" Trump said. ""And you know, when the NFL ratings are down massively -- massively -- the NFL ratings are down massively, now the No. 1 reason happens to be that they like watching what happens with yours truly. They like what's happening.""During his rally in Alabama, protesting players weren't the only ones who Trump took a shot at. The president also blasted the NFL for becoming too soft. Trump said that all NFL's new rules against big hits is making the game unwatchable. ""Today, if you hit too hard, if they hit too hard, 'Fifteen yards, throw him out of the game,'"" Trump said. ""They had that last week, I watched for a couple of minutes.""Trump's rant also got kind of bizarre when he started to blame some of the NFL's softness on the league's officials. ""Two guys, just a really beautiful tackle, boom, fifteen yards, the referee gets on television, his wife is sitting at home, she's so proud of him,"" Trump said. ""They're ruining the game, right? They're ruining the game.""This is the second time in less than a year that Trump has called the NFL soft. Back in October 2016, then presidential candidate Trump said that the league's concussion rules were making the NFL soft. Trump must've forgotten for a second that he was in the college football capital of the world because he seemed to lose the crowd for a second after bringing up the fact that the sport of football is being ""ruined,"" so he went back to his original topic: Anthem protesters. ""They want to hit, but it is hurting the game, but you know what's hurting the game more than that? When people like yourselves turn on television and you see those people taking the knee when they're playing our great national anthem,"" Trump said. Trump closed the NFL portion of his speech by telling fans that they should leave the stadium if they see a player protest. ""The only thing you could do better is if you see it, even if it's one player, leave the stadium, I guarantee you things will stop,"" Trump said. ""Things will stop. Just pick up and leave.""Trump was in Alabama on Friday to help sway the vote in an upcoming run-off for one of the state's seats in the U.S. Senate. Trump was there to support Sen. Luther Strange (R-Ala.), who was appointed to his spot February after former Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions was named Attorney General. Strange is running against Roy Moore in a special election that will be held on Sept. 26. You can see the entire portion of Trump's NFL speech below. Pres.

It is also versatile and can be used for ""sport shooting, hunting and self-defense situations,"" the NRA said, adding the ability to ""personalize"" so many of the rifle's components ""is one of the things that makes it so unique.""The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence said the AR-15, a civilian model of the military's M-16, also cited the weapon's versatility in evaluating its popularity.""They're accurate and they can basically shoot as quickly as you can pull the trigger,"" according to a campaign statement.""Along those lines, they're very customizable — most average people can figure out how to install accessories like forward trigger grips that let you hold the gun at waist height and spray bullets while stabilizing the gun, laser sights, and you can add high-capacity magazines.""But Dean Hazen, owner of The Gun Experts in Mahomet, Ill., and a master firearms instructor, said the reason mass shooters are turning to the AR-15 is due to a ""copy-cat"" mentality more than any feature of the rifle.""It's really just a perception thing,"" Hazen said. ""There are rifles that are more powerful and more dangerous than that, but they're not being used.""Hazen said the AR-15 has ""gotten a bad rap.""

Other research has found that people with type AB and B blood have a much higher risk of developing pancreatic cancer.People of different blood types react differently to stress.Type A people naturally have higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol in their bodies and produce more in response to stressful situations. On the other hand, people with type O blood, have a 'fight or flight' reaction to stress which results in the overproduction of adrenaline. It takes type O's longer to recover from stress because it is more difficult for them to clear the adrenaline from their bodies.Read More Blood Group Genetics, Exercise and StressYour blood type antigens are not just in your blood!They are everywhere in your body, particularly in the surfaces that interact with the environment. These include your digestive tract, from your mouth to your large intestine, as well as your nasal passages and lungs. Because these blood type antigens are everywhere, they influence how your body reacts to the food you eat through several factors. For example: the lectins in certain foods bind to your blood type antigen and cause your blood to agglutinate (stick together), resulting in feelings of fatigue, headaches, digestive issues, skin problems and a host of other health issues.Gut bacteria is related to blood type.People of different blood types have different gut bacteria, in fact, certain bacteria are 50,000 more likely to turn up in people with one blood type or the other. This originated from our ancestors whose digestive tracts developed to accommodate one type of diet over another. For example, the microbiome of certain people developed to break down carbohydrates much more efficiently (blood type A). People lacking this ability (blood type O) tend to store carbs as fat.A one-size-fits-all approach to nutrition does not work.Food fads come and go, but the facts are clear: everyone does not have the same basic nutritional needs. We all know someone who is a strict vegetarian and thrives on that diet, while others swear by Atkins or similar low-carb plans. I've found that your nutritional needs can be determined by your blood type. Take a look at the food lists in Eat Right 4 Your Type; they are a guide for choosing the foods that will allow you to lose weight, reduce inflammation, increase energy and lead a longer, healthier life.As you've learned, your blood type affects more than just the type of blood you'd need in the event of a transfusion â your blood type is a genetic factor that plays many roles in the human body. Choosing low-lectin, non-agglutinating foods that create a hospitable environment for your good' intestinal flora and selecting foods that combat your disease risks are two good first steps in creating an individualized nutritional program just for you.Parts Excerpted From: mindbodygreen.com One of the hallmarks of alternative medicine is the recognition of the biochemical uniqueness of each individual and the need to tailor treatments and prescriptions to match that individual variability. While a person's genetic code, ultimately, is the basis of this individuality, basing treatments on genetic factors is too broad an approach and not consistent with alternative medicine. According to naturopathic physician Peter J. D'Adamo, N.D., in his book Eat Right 4 Your Type, the missing link might be the four basic blood types: O, A, B, and AB. ""There had to be a reason why there were so many paradoxes in dietary studies and disease survival,"" why some people lose weight and others do not on the same diet or why some people keep their vitality as they age, and others do not, says Dr. D'Adamo. His research into anthropology, medical history, and genetics led him to conclude that blood type is ""the key that unlocks the door to the mysteries of health, disease, longevity, physical vitality, and emotional strength."" Dr. D'Adamo explains that the practical application of the blood type ""key"" is that it enables you to make informed choices about your dietary, exercise, supplement, and even medical treatment plans. With the blood type ""road map,"" these plans can now ""correspond to your exact biological profile"" and ""the dynamic natural forces within your own body."" Read More Blood Groups and the History of PeoplesType O-People with type O blood fare best on intense physical exercise and animal proteins and less well on dairy products and grains, says Dr. D'Adamo. The leading reason for weight gain among Type O's is the gluten found in wheat products and, to a lesser extent, lentils, corn, kidney beans, and cabbage, Dr. D'Adamo explains. Ideal exercises for Type O's include aerobics, martial arts, contact sports, and running. Type A-Those with blood type A, however, are more naturally suited to a vegetarian diet and foods that are fresh, pure, and organic. As Type A's are predisposed to heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, ""I can't emphasize how critical this dietary adjustment can be to the sensitive immune system of Type A,"" says Dr. D'Adamo. Type A's can derive significant benefit from calming, centering exercise, such as yoga and tai chi. Type B-Type B's have a robust immune system and a tolerant digestive system and tend to resist many of the severe chronic degenerative illnesses, or at least survive them better than the other blood types. Type B's do best with moderate physical exercise requiring mental balance, such as hiking, cycling, tennis, and swimming. Type AB-Blood type AB, the most recent, in terms of evolution, of the four groups and an amalgam of types A and B, is the most biologically complex. For this group, a combination of the exercises for types A and B works best, says Dr. D'Adamo. Blood type, with its digestive and immune specificity, is a window on a person's probable susceptibility to or power over disease, according to Dr. D'Adamo. For example, Type O's are the most likely to suffer from asthma, hay fever, and other allergies, while Type B's have a high allergy threshold, and will react allergically only if they eat the wrong foods. Type B's are also especially susceptible to autoimmune disorders, such as chronic fatigue, lupus, and multiple sclerosis. Type AB's tend to have the fewest problems with allergies, while heart disease, cancer, and anemia are medical risks for them. With arthritis, Type O's, again, are the predominant sufferers because their immune systems are ""environmentally intolerant,"" especially to foods such as grains and potatoes which can produce inflammatory reactions in their joints, says Dr. D'Adamo. Types A and B are the most susceptible to diabetes, while types A and AB have an overall higher rate of cancer and poorer survival odds than the other types. Lectins and Blood TypeA chemical reaction occurs between your blood and the foods you eat. This reaction is part of your genetic inheritance. It is amazing but true that today, in the twenty first century, your immune and digestive systems still maintain favoritism for foods that your blood type ancestors ate.We know this because of a factor called lectins. Lectins, abundant and diverse proteins found in foods, have agglutinating properties that affect your blood and the lining of your digestive tract. Lectins are a powerful way for organisms in nature to attach themselves to other organisms in nature. Lots of germs, and even our own immune systems, use this super glue to their benefit. For example, cells in our liver's bile ducts have lectins on their surfaces to help snatch up bacteria and parasites. Bacteria and other microbes have lectins on their surfaces as well, which work rather like suction cups, so that they can attach to the slippery mucosal linings of the body. Often the lectins used by viruses or bacteria can be blood type specific, making them a stickier pest for people of that blood type.So, too, with the lectins in food. Simply put, when you eat a food containing protein lectins that are incompatible with your blood type antigen, the lectins target an organ or bodily system (kidneys, liver, gut, stomach, etc.) and can begin to interact with the tissues in that area.Read More Blood Types and the Lectin ConnectionWhile you cannot change your blood type, you can use knowledge about its nature to implement a dietary plan biologically suited to your makeup, says Dr. D'Adamo, who supplies copious details on eating plans for all four types. ""Most of my patients experience some results [within two weeks of starting the diet plan]-increased energy, weight loss, a lessening of digestive complaints, and improvement of chronic conditions such as asthma, headaches, and heartburn.""Parts Excerpted From: Alternative Medicine Digest, Future Medicine PublishingReviewed and revised on: 05/02/18The statements made on our websites have not been evaluated by the FDA (U.S. Food & Drug Administration).Our products and services are not intended to diagnose, cure or prevent any disease.

Monday also marked an all-time record with $40.151M, beating Force Awakens‘ $40.11M (Dec. 21, 2015).

Tuesday 7:20 AM Update: Industry morning estimates indicate that Disney/Marvel’s Black Panther has cleared $242M, which means that the superhero now owns the second-best 4-day opening of all-time behind Star Wars: The Force Awakens ($288.07M) and slashes the FSSM run of Star Wars: The Last Jedi ($241.6M) last December. It’s still early and Disney has yet to call the record. The 4-day for Black Panther should be around $242.4M. Ticket sales for the Ryan Coogler-directed movie were -34% on Presidents Day Monday for $40M-$40.1M. With those figures, Black Panther could very well own the all-time Monday domestic record as well, beating Force Awakens’ $40.1M. Another big winner for Disney, which now owns eight of the top 10 slots on the all-time domestic openers chart. Black Panther slotted 5th this weekend with $201.8M, and it’s only one of five titles to crack past the two-century mark in a three-day period. UPDATED, Monday AM writethru after 12:05 AM post: Disney has verified this morning what we saw in the middle of the night, that T’Challa recorded the second-best Sunday ever at the domestic box office. Its $60.1 million (higher than the industry’s $59.55M estimate last night) ranks only behind the all-time record held by Disney/Lucasfilm’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens ($60.5M on December 20, 2015). The total now pushes Black Panther to a three-day total of $201.8M, still the fifth-best domestic opening of all time after 2012’s Avengers ($207.4M). Disney does see Black Panther making $235M over four days, which means it will beat the Friday-Monday hauls of of Avengers ($226.3M) and Jurassic World ($234.1M). But there are those in the industry who believe T’Challa has a shot to be the second-highest four-day opener ever with as much as $242M-$245M — behind Star Wars: Force Awakens ($288M) but taking out Star Wars: The Last Jedi ($241.6M). In order for Black Panther to claw his way to that height, it would mean that Monday’s ease from Sunday would range between 30%-32%, or $40.3M, to $41.75M. Disney’s projections this morning figure today will decline 45% from Sunday, in which case Presidents Day would yield $33.2M for a $235M Friday-Saturday-Sunday-Monday. Black Panther has ripped up all previous pre-summer comps, which has made Monday a challenge for many to predict; the film has gotten this high at the B.O. and there’s no question about it going higher. Another factor juicing ticket sales, as we mentioned earlier, is that the ages 18-24 crowd comes out in bulk after 10 PM, and that contributes to the swing factor with these forecasts by the time the sun comes up. No doubt people will continue to flock to the movies today, with ComScore’s school calendar showing 88% K-12 out and 34% of all colleges off. Drilling down on Black Panther‘s performance: Six out of the top 10 locations were in New York, two in Los Angeles (Arclight Hollywood and Burbank), Atlantic Station in Atlanta and DC’s Tysons. Black Panther had 612 runs gross north of $100,000 for the weekend; of those, 119 venues did over $200K, 20 did $300K+, and five minted $400K. AMC Empire NY cleared $500K, while AMC Atlantic Station’s shot past $600K over the three days. One studio analyst this morning projects a $500M final domestic B.O. for Black Panther. UPDATED, Sunday 8:05 AM: Disney is reporting Sunday estimates of $192M over three days for Black Panther and $218M over four. However, Black Panther domination is far from over. Industry estimates believe it’s significantly higher at $195.3M three-day for Marvel’s Black Panther and a $225.7M four-day, and that’s because hourlies are flying off the grid, with some analysts’ four-day projections at $230M. Saturday raked in $65.9M, according to Disney, and their report this morning shows Black Panther as the fifth-highest opening of all-time on the three-day domestic chart after Avengers ($207.4M) and before Avengers: Age of Ultron ($191.3M). The Ryan Coogler-directed superhero movie is also beating Ultron‘s four-day take of $204.4M. Going into the weekend and throughout, we have emphasized what a cultural milestone Black Panther is as a movie directed by an African-American filmmaker and largely starring a Black-ensemble cast. Back in the 1990s, following Demolition Man, Wesley Snipes tried to get his own version of Black Panther up and running. This resulted in visionary differences after talks with such directors as John Singleton and Mario Van Peebles. In addition, one of the commercial concerns at the time was that moviegoers would confuse the Stan Lee-Jack Kirby superhero as a member of the 1960s Civil Rights group. That is obviously not a concern in the modern day era of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In addition, as Ben Fritz’s new book The Big Picture: The Fight for the Future of the Movies reveals, Sony had a shot in the late 1990s to make Black Panther in addition to a number of other Marvel superhero movies in a rights deal valued at $25M. But Sony brass crazily refused at the time, believing that the only moolah and mass appeal was in Spider-Man. Who better than Disney and Marvel now to spread the gospel of inclusion. Says Disney distribution boss Dave Hollis this morning, “Inclusion and representation matter. We’ve seen it time and again and the results speak for themselves, whether it’s a female protagonist in the Star Wars movies, the representation of Polynesian in Moana, or the wonderful story in Coco which was embraced so proudly around the world. We make movies for a global audience of 7 billion who come from all walks of life and reflect the diversity of our world. What makes the projection for Black Panther so wild is the non-stop bulk of people who are still yearning to see the picture. There are lines around the block for the film in New York City. The 18-24 demo per ComScore is huge on this movie at 36%; they’re always the most difficult to get into the theater nowadays. “They’re the audience coming after 10 PM and the growth we had after that time period is bigger than expected,” explains Hollis. It’s that swing that keeps pushing projections up between midnight and 6AM on Black Panther. Disney expects to make $50.3M today on the Ryan Coogler-directed film and another $26.1M on Monday. Industry forecasts are at $52.4M for today and $30.4M for President’s Day. From an admissions-revenue standpoint, yesterday was the second-biggest Saturday in AMC’s history, slightly behind the all-time AMC Saturday record set on Dec. 26, 2015 by Star Wars: The Force Awakens (that includes both AMC and Carmike pre-merger). The largest exhibitor in the world also saw 80 of its theaters repping 10% of its stateside circuit, setting admissions-revenue records for a single title on opening weekend. Fandango is reporting a significantly higher rate of repeat customers for Black Panther than it has seen for other superhero movies on an opening weekend. Group sales are unprecedented for Black Panther in a way that no Disney or exhibition insider has ever seen before. “Whatever you think the box office is, it always does better,” beams Imax CEO Greg Foster about Black Panther‘s momentum. “It’s not like anything we’ve ever experienced before, it has taken on its own life,” added Hollis on Black Panther‘s B.O. Imax’s 404 screens, driven by 77% in 2D, are grossing $20M over FSS and $23M over FSSM. That’s a record February for the large format exhibitor, and the best-ever for any Marvel title and the fourth-best all-time. Per Imax, screen averages were $49k over three-days and $56k over four-days. Audience members watch the beginning of Black Panther during a private screening on Friday in Grand Blanc, Michigan. Elizabeth Frank, Executive VP of Global Programming and Chief Content Officer at AMC exclaims, “Black Panther has taken on a life of its own at movie theatres, playing to huge, broad audiences in AMC markets around the country. We’re delighted with the stories and pictures of fans who are enjoying the magic of the movie theater and turning the experience into a community event. With the opening of Black Panther, ComScore reports that the annual box office for the period of Jan. 1 through Feb. 18 surges ahead of the 2017’s frame by 6.1%, with a running total of $1.575 billion. All titles this weekend grossed $278 million, +85% versus the same weekend a year ago. Screen Engine/ComScore PostTrak reports 37% African-Americans attending, followed by 35% Caucasian, 18% Hispanic, and 5% Asian (they update their exit polls throughout the weekend, as they continually poll). Still, 95% overall positive. Leading demos: Men under 25 (29%), men 25+ (27%), women 25+ (23%) and women under 25 (21%). Overall, it’s a great weekend for the global film business: As Black Panther is breaking records over here and beyond, so is Monster Hunt 2 in China. U.S. distributors took the opportunity to tap into the heat from Chinese New Year on Friday with a trio of releases, with Warner Bros. winning out with Chen Sicheng’s Detective Chinatown 2 ($677K 3-day, $800K 4-day), followed by Lionsgate’s Monster Hunt 2 ($335K 3-day, $390K 4-day), and WellGoUSA’s Monkey King 3 ($91K 3-day, $100K 4-day). Among those Chinese releases that have debuted in the states over the last three years, Detective Chinatown 2 marks the second best debut after Sony’s The Mermaid two years ago, which debuted to $985K. Ten months ago, Warner Bros. took domestic from Wanda on Detective Chinatown 2. This was an opportunity for the Burbank studio to partner with China on original content, appeal to Asian audiences’ needs stateside, and to propel young Chinese filmmakers in the North American marketplace. In addition, next to other distributors, Warner Bros. also has more muscle in its P&A spend to ensure that Detective Chinatown 2 is a success. Detective Chinatown 2. Sunday 12:31AM post:Disney/Marvel’s Black Panther is even more ferocious than ever imagined. Late night estimates (not from Disney) indicate that T’Challa is headed to $194M over three-days after a super Saturday night between $66.8M-$68M which is only 11% down from Friday on the high-end. Also if you back out $25.2M Thursday previews from Friday’s $76.4M, Saturday’s business is still technically +33%. So that means business for Black Panther wasn’t front-loaded. Four-day figures remain a wild forecast for many analysts: They’re certain that Black Panther is expected to clear $220M, but he could fly as high as $230M. Projections at this minute are averaging around $223M. Over three-days, Black Panther now beats Avengers: Age of Ultron‘s 3-day number of $191.2M for the fifth best opening of all-time behind Avengers ($207.4M). On a four-day basis, it will also beat Ultron ($204.4M), but it might kick Avengers 4-day haul as well ($226.3M). It’s summer box office records during the second month of the year. Ryan Coogler went up to his hometown of Oakland on Thursday night to surprise Black Panther fans at previews while Chadwick Boseman, Coogler, Marvel boss Kevin Feige, EP Louis D’Esposito and the Marvel gang surprised fans at the Cinemark LA and other theaters in town on Friday night. Look who dropped by our signing last night- BLACK PANTHER himself @chadwickboseman !!! AND director Ryan Coogler!! AND @Kevfeige @louisde2 Nate Moore, Jonathan Schwartz, @bradwinderbaum David Grant & Stephen Broussard- producers from @MarvelStudios AMAZING night! Sony’s Peter Rabbit still looking to steal second place from Fifty Shades Freed with $17M over 3-days, $22M over 4 with an 11-day total of $53.2M in weekend 2. Universal’s E.L. James threequel taking third with a $17.3M 3-day, but $19.3M 4-day for a running total of $78.4M. We’ll have more updates in the morning. Saturday AM writethru, after Friday, 8:58PM: By the time the four-day President’s Day holiday stretch ends, Black Panther will have surpassed many of Marvel’s mightiest on the all-time domestic B.O. openers chart. Not to mention Disney continues to crowd the list, now taking up eight of the top 10 slots. Black Panther is now looking at the sixth-best opening of all-time on a three-day-basis with an estimated $185.8M per industry projections Saturday AM and a mind-blowing $213M over four days. Note that between Friday night and this morning (roughly a seven-hour time frame), estimates changed. Currently, Saturday should see around $61M which puts us at these figures. Anything significantly greater, and Black Panther breaks even more records. How much do moviegoers love Black Panther? The Ryan Coogler-directed movie earned an A+ CinemaScore, Marvel’s second after 2012’s The Avengers. On Screen Engine/ComScore PostTrak, moviegoers are giving the pic an 88% definite recommend, a 95% overall positive score, while a third plan to see it again in the theater. On the three-day all-time chart, Black Panther is just above Captain America: Civil War ($179.1M). Back in January, Fandango reported that out of the gate in its first 24 hours, Black Panther outstripped the advance tickets sales of Civil War. However, analysts didn’t rush to comp the Wakanda superhero to Marvel’s other titles. They just couldn’t believe at the time how massive this was going to be. PostTrak reports that 55% of the crowd bought their tickets online, indicating it was a major event for many, just like a Star Wars film. While Black Panther is under Avengers: Age of Ultron on the three-day all-time openers list ($191.2M), the pic is beating the sequel’s four-day run ($204.4M). Black Panther has already left Disney’s Beauty and the Beast ($174.7M) and WB/DC’s Batman v. Superman ($166M) in the dust to become the biggest pre-summer opener of all-time. Black Panther is now at $76.4M for Friday. Thursday’s previews of $25.2M rep 33% of Friday’s ticket sales. Similar to a Star Wars title, Black Panther was a big pre-planned event for many this weekend, with Fandango advance ticket sales driving 36% of Thursday’s preview figure or $9M. We hear from PostTrak that African American moviegoers at 40% are driving Black Panther‘s ticket sales. Diverse casts in films like Star Wars: The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi, the Fast and the Furious series, Twilight and Hunger Games have always yielded big business, but Black Panther, with its near-total Black ensemble cast, is a groundbreaking landmark for Hollywood. Disney will continue to break glass ceilings soon after Black Panther: On March 9, the studio will open the feature adaptation of the children’s classic A Wrinkle In Time, which at a $100M-plus budget is the first production of its scope to be directed by a woman of color, Oscar nominee Ava DuVernay (at one point before Coogler, she was in talks to potentially direct Black Panther). The pic is currently tracking for an opening around $35M four weeks out from release, but those estimates are bound to increase. Between Black Panther and Wrinkle, Disney will own the pre-summer space, much like they did with Zootopia and Jungle Book in 2016. In addition, Disney certainly has to be trailoring Wrinkle on Black Panther. In addition, Disney’s 2019 live-action release The Lion King touts a large Black cast that includes Beyonce, Donald Glover, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Keegan-Michael Key, James Earl Jones, Alfre Woodard and Eric Andre, among many others. Black Panther in CinemaScore audience exits shows a 50/50 male-female audience with 25+ repping 66% of the crowd. Close to 70% came because it’s Black Panther, while 15% bought tickets because of Coogler and 28% because they are Michael B. Jordan and Chadwick Boseman fans. Already, the leading exhibitor AMC is reporting that 33 venues have already set admissions-revenue records for a single title on an opening weekend in play at the chain, and Saturday isn’t even over yet. Twenty-one AMC locations held more than 40 showtimes for Black Panther with AMC Southlake 24, in the Atlanta market, recording an astounding 83 showtimes yesterday. Social media is on fire as people leave the theater: RelishMix is reporting that Twitter hashtags for #BlackPanther and @TheBlackPanther have set an all-time movie record since Thursday night, with 559K unique Twitter posts in one day (100K per day is exceptional) — and that’s over twice what the social media monitor saw with #LastJedi which peaked out at 232K in a day back in December. After hiring Boseman back in October 2014 in a five-picture deal, Marvel spurred momentum for Black Panther by introducing him in Captain America: Civil War. Disney literally showed the media the first footage of the casino heist scene back in April during a Marvel press day. That footage became public back in July, when the studio unveiled it at San Diego Comic-Con. Captain America: Civil War. Disney aired the first trailer for Black Panther in June during the NBA Finals Game 4, clocking 89M views in the first 24 hours. In addition, there was another trailer during NBA’s opening night on Oct. 17. Tickets went on sale on Jan. 8. This was announced during the ESPN College Football National Championship. Kendrick Lamar had a halftime performance during that event; he produced an album of songs from and inspired by the film. RelishMix notes, “Panther successfully took a page out of other big social movies like Pitch Perfect 3 and Fifty Shades Freed” in harnessing the social media powers of recording artists Lamar, The Weeknd and SZA. There was a massive synergy program with integrations in ESPN College Football Playoffs and on ABC’s Blackish, Grownish, TGIT (Grey’s Anatomy, Scandal, How to Get Away With Murder), and Bravo’s Real Housewives. In the last week on ESPN, NBA All-Star D’Andre Jordan carpooled to an arena with Kenny Mayne, where they get a rare sighting of the Black Panther in an integrated car chase cameo. RelishMix reports that Black Panther‘s social media universe resides at 901M, which is off the charts for a February release, especially when stacked up against other Marvel titles and their first week SMU’s, i.e. Thor: Ragnarok at 858M and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 at 792M. Black Panther counts 390K daily YouTube views, driving toward a total of 340M, which is immense, and nearly matching those on Facebook (330M). Some of Disney’s social media stunts for the pic included the first-ever video Q&A on Tumblr with Boseman. There was also a Twitter live Q&A event in NYC (Feb. 12) streamed globally and into 10 IMAX theaters around the US – archived for placements in Apple TV, Roku, Amazon (it’s a social marketing stunt that no other studio has attempted on such a mass scale). Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. Black Panther had a presence at New York Fashion Week on Feb. 13, working with such renegade designers as Cushnie Et Ochs, Ikiré Jones, Tome, Sophie Theallet, Fear of God, Chromat, and Laquan Smith, who created custom pieces inspired by the film. Promo partners included Lexus, which ran a spot during Super Bowl LII titled “Long Live the King,” with fresh footage and clips showing the superhero’s sister and bodyguard using the 2018 Lexus LS 500 F Sport performance sedan to collect him. By partnering with Black Panther, The Toyota Motor Corp. auto brand was aiming at a younger demographic, and in the ad world, the younger the demo is, the more culturally diverse. According to RelishMix, the Lexus tie-in spot generated 4.3M views on social following the Super Bowl telecast. Black Panther star Michael B. Jordan worked closely with the movie’s other promo partner, Pepsi’s Brisk Ice Tea. PepsiCo and Unilever launched an arts program in urban areas in partnership with Jordan, providing an opportunity to young film, visual arts and writing visionaries to be mentored by established artists. Jordan directed, produced and starred in a Super Bowl commercial celebrating artists’ creative hustle and spotlighting his process for transforming into his Black Panther character Erik Killmonger. Creators had the chance to win an apprenticeship at Jordan’s production company. In addition, Brisk hosted an event for Black Panther fans during the NBA All-Star weekend in Los Angeles, CA, on Feb. 16-17 with interactive Marvel-inspired installations. The pop-up event showcased the nine new Brisk labels created by emerging artists to kick off and promote the Creators Class program. The labels will debut on all Brisk packaging nationwide later this month. Lancome featured a line of make-up products worn by Black Panther stars Lupita Nyong’o and Letitia Wright on the red carpet. Synchrony Financial teamed with Coogler and Marvel to award the Ghetto Film School Fellows program with a $50K grant. The Ghetto Film School Fellows is a non-profit program that helps aspiring filmmakers from local communities, giving them a better chance at reaching their dreams, free of charge. The students take part in a 30-month process in which they can visit sets, screen their films, and find help to get into college. Coogler stopped by the Ghetto Film School to speak to students. –On Saturday night, Jumanji : Welcome to the Jungle will become Sony’s second-highest movie of all-time at the domestic box office. We’ve been saying this for a while, but it’s really happening this weekend. The Jake Kasdan-directed movie sails by Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man 2 ($373.5M) and is now behind the director’s original Spider-Man movie ($403.7M). –Also tonight, Fox’s The Greatest Showman, also in the same 9th weekend as Jumanji, will fly by Oscar-winner La La Land‘s $151.1M domestic total, the title responsible for reinvigorating the original musical on screen. There’s no such thing as coincidence, and both musicals featured music by the Oscar-winning songwriting team of Benj Pasek and Justin Paul. –Lionsgate/Studio Canal/Aardman’s Early Man is coming in with a lowly estimated $4.7M over four-days, which is just not good for any movie. There’s simply too much family product in the marketplace, with Peter Rabbit, Jumanji and then you have Black Panther pulling in everybody. Lionsgate gets a distribution fee and is on the hook for P&A, with StudioCanal covering it. Early Man gets a B CinemaScore. Twenty percent of the audience was under 18, with 72% being over. The young set gave it a B+ and 74% bought tickets because it was an Aardman Animation title. —China’s megahit Monster Hunt 2 ,which now owns the Middle Kingdom record for the best single day at the B.O. with $97M, is also in play stateside. Pic looks to make an estimated $529K over four days in 70 locations. Industry estimates for the weekend of Feb. Friday, 11:53AM: The first set of estimates are in, and they’re showing that Disney/Marvel’s Black Panther is headed toward a historic weekend with $200M-$205M over four-days, $175M over three. These figures do not come from Disney. The Ryan Coolger-directed, an co-written pic with Joe Robert Cole should post an estimated $72M today, with last night’s $25.2M previews repping 35% of that number. On a three-day and four-day basis, Black Panther‘s estimates are easily the pre-summer records beating Beauty and the Beast ($174.7M 3-day, $188.2M 4-day) and Warner Bros./DC’s Batman v. Superman ($166M 3-day, $181M 4-day). If these figures maintain, then Black Panther will own the 7th best opening of all-time at the domestic box office behind Captain America: Civil War ($179M). The pic is also on track to beat Marvel’s Iron Man 3 ($174.1M 3-day, $185.4M 4-day). Beyond amazing, especially for this time of year, but this holiday always works in the majors’ favor: ComScore reports that 23% K-12 and 9% colleges are off today, figures which will respectively spike to 88% out and 34% out by Monday. Over four-days, Coogler’s Black Panther beats the first four days of F. Gary Gray’s Fate of the Furious’ debut by 86% (or $107.3M). Gray owned the previous opening record for a movie directed by an African American. Universal’s Fifty Shades Freed is estimated to take $5.5M today, -70% with a 4-day between $15M-$20M in second place. On the high end, this sends the threequel’s cume to $79M-plus. Lionsgate/StudioCanal/Aardman’s family title Early Man is eyeing $1.1M today, $6.1M over four-days in its opening. PureFlix’s sword and sandal movie Samson is looking at $750K for Friday, $2.6M over the four-day holiday. A huge shoutout for this weekend: Never bet against Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron singing together. 20th Century Fox’s original musical The Greatest Showman which was slow out of the gate will out-sing Lionsgate’s Oscar-winning La La Land ($151.1M) at the domestic box office on Saturday. Benj Pasek and Justin Paul won last year’s original song Oscar for “City of Stars” from the Damien Chazelle feature musical, and the songwriting duo are up again this year for “This Is Me” from The Greatest Showman. The original musical about P.T. Barnum will earn $5M-$6M over four days. The Greatest Showman. Friday, 8:24AM: Black Panther‘s previews are exactly where we told you we would see them and Disney is reporting $25.2M this morning. This is the second best Thursday ever for a Marvel movie after Avengers: Age of Ultron ($27.6M) and some nickels above Captain America: Civil War ($25M). Among pre-summer releases and their preview nights, Black Panther ranks second behind Batman v. Superman ($27.7M). Already, according to Fandango, 61% are considering seeing Black Panther a second time. Imax auditoriums grossed roughly $3M last night, which is tied with the large format exhibitor’s results for Ultron and Civil War. Black Panther Imax figures also blew away the preview results of Deadpool which made $2.265m on 372 screens two years ago. Black Panther is in play on 404 Imax screens. A bulk of advance tickets have been purchased by churches, youth groups, fraternities, sororities, and student groups as they celebrate the first major Black ensemble blockbuster on screen. There is a viral crowd-sourcing effort that has taken place called the #BlackPantherChallenge — which allows kids to see the movie for free. Frederick Joseph, a New York-based philanthropist, launched the crowd-funding initiative last month to raise $40K and help children in Harlem see the movie. The challenge fueled 400 GoFundMe drives that have raised over $400K. Donations have arrived from J.J. Abrams, Chelsea Clinton, Viola Davis, and Ellen DeGeneres (who pledged $10K to the Boys and Girls Club of Harlem). Thanks to you, the #BlackPantherChallenge became the largest GoFundMe in history for an entertainment event. Then you raised $300k, enough to buy tickets for over 23k children. NOW…you’ve raised over $400k around the world, enough to send over 30k children to see the film! In Sacramento, Cyrus Mulitalo, a Sacramento State football hall of famer took advantage of the challenge and is sending 200 kids to see the movie on Saturday. We’ve already reported below that Oscar winner Octavia Spencer bought out two theaters in Mississippi so children would get the chance to see Black Panther. Here is Davis’ rally for the challenge. PREVIOUS EXCLUSIVE: Writethru with demos, 11:20pm: We have a read on Thursday night estimates for Disney/Marvel’s Black Panther — and they look fantastic. Earlier tonight sources were spotting the movie between $22M-$24M, and now the thinking is that the Ryan Coogler-directed movie about Marvel’s Black superhero T’Challa will clear $25M. Black Panther will either beat or tie with Captain America: Civil War ($25M) as the second best Marvel preview ever behind Avengers: Age of Ultron ($27.6M). This is also easily the second biggest pre-summer preview night ever behind Batman V. Superman which made $27.7M. On the high end, it’s nearly double the $12.7M what Deadpool posted prior to its record February four-day weekend of $152.1M. These early estimates for Black Panther are exclusively from Deadline, so if you see them reported by a rival trade, they got them from us. Other records being broken: Advance ticket sales continue to go wild over at Fandango with Black Panther now their fourth-biggest pre-seller of all-time behind Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Star Wars: The Last Jedi and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. A few weeks ago, Fandango reported that Black Panther is their biggest superhero ticket-seller. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. Note there is a margin of error when shooting from the hip this early. Tonight’s numbers could be much higher by morning. If Black Panther continues on this pace, it’s looking approximately at $65M for Friday (including Thursday), $161M over three and $180M-plus for four. Again, none of this comes from Disney. Already in its first two days abroad, Black Panther, with $23.3M, is beating the opening figures of MCU deeper universe character Doctor Strange. It’s a special night and weekend for many people. Black Panther is a cultural milestone, becoming the highest-grossing title to star a Black ensemble cast. It will also be a record-breaking opening for an African-American director. Already, in ComScore/Screen Engine PostTrak audience reactions Black Panther is flying off the charts with an enormous 91% definite recommend (Typically anything in the 70% range is pretty good) and an overall 96% positive score and five-star rating. Those over 25 at 61% are the biggest crowd turning out with M25+ (34%), F25+ (27%), M25- (21%) an F25- (18%). Regal cinemas and 270 RealD locations are showing exclusive content from Black Panther in over 270 locations at 6PM tonight, preceding the film. Octavia Spencer has bought out two Feb. 17 screenings of Black Panther in Mississippi for those “families who are low on funds,” just as she promised in her Jan. 31 Instagram Tweet. On January 31, she posted that she was planning on buying out some screenings “in an under-served community there to ensure that all our brown children can see themselves as a superhero. I will let you know where and when Mississippi. Stay tuned.",2018/02/16,snopes,0
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/rhinos-elephants-getting-pink-horns-prevent-poaching/,photograph shows a rhino that was given a pink horn to prevent poaching.,Mixture,['poaching'],http://www.pri.org/,http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-03-22/poisoning-rhino-horns-doesnt-hurt-rhinos-it-may-keep-poachers-away,2015/05/22,"Rhinos with poison-infused horns are roaming the bush in South Africa, frightening away poachers who don’t want sell a toxic product to their clients in Asia. At least that’s what Lorina Hern hopes. Hern, the co-founder of the Rhino Rescue Project, has spent the last four years “devaluing” the horns of rhinos by infusing them with ectoparasiticides — or anti-parasite drugs — and pink dye. The dye isn't visble on the outside, and the ectoparasiticides are harmless to the rhinos when injected into their horns. But humans who handle or consume the horns may not be so lucky. “At a minimum it would start with diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, severe headaches, all the way up to nervous symptoms, which could be permanent,” Hern says. “Some ectoparasiticides also precipitate the development of cancers later on in life.” Lorinda Hern is the co-founder of the Rhino Rescue Project. Credit: Bobby Bascomb Rhino Rescue does its work on behalf of wildlife parks and game reserves looking to protect their rhinos from poachers. Wildlife tourism brings billions of dollars into the South African economy each year, and tourists expect to see rhinos on their safari tours. That makes rhinos expensive: One animal can cost an owner more than $20,000. But the demand for rhino horns in Asia, where they are believed to have medicinal and aphrodisiac qualities, has made a single rhino horn worth 10 times that on the black market, making the animals tempting targets for poachers. To protect their investments, more and more parks are buying insurance for their high-risk animals. The biggest wild life insurance company in South Africa, One Financial Services, charges $700 a year to insure a rhino against poaching. “The poaching risk is so horrendous that it is close to being uninsurable,” says Peter Darroll, a development manager for One Financial Services. The rhino insurance business doesn't make the company much money, he says, but it helps them attract business for more profitable policies on animals like buffaloes. Profitable or not, One Financial Services still requires that rhinos undergo the horn posioning procedure before they can be covered under the company’s policy. It starts with Hern and her team tranquilizing the animals by darting them from a helicopter. As the rhinos begin to lose consciousness, they are laid on their side. Technicians drill three holes into the horn an inject the poison and the dye under high pressure. The procedure has its risks. In 2012, a white male rhino named Spencer died while under anesthesia, but a veterinarian who was an independent observer believed he had an underlying medical condition. Horns also grow relatively quickly, so the toxins and dye are only effective for four years before the process has to be repeated. This video from photographer Joey Skibel gives you an idea of what the process looks like in action: A day in the Life of the Rhino Rescue Project with the founder Lorinda Hern by Joey Skibel The South African National Park Service has not been supportive of Rhino Rescue’s work. The government organization has co-authored a report critical of the horn-poisoning method and its effectiveness. ""This strategy will never help in quelling rhino poaching in the park because we have so many rhino such that we can't even manage to capture them,” park spokesperson William Mabasa told government news agency SANews. But it's not a full condemnation. “I do think it will be a good thing for the individuals who own few rhinos,"" he added. Hern maintains the government is biased against the horn poisoning technique because officials want to eventually legalize and regulate the trade; Rhino Rescue vigorously contests the government report’s findings on its website. And the goal of the horn poisoning isn’t to poison every rhino’s horn, or even stop poaching all together: It’s meant to sow doubt in the minds of poachers and horn buyers. That's why a key step in the process has nothing to do with the rhinos themselves, but with community outreach. A local takes a photo of Rhino after it has been treated by Rhino Rescue. Credit: Courtsey of Rhino Rescue. Hern estimates that up to 90 percent of poachers plan their attacks based on inside information from park workers or locals. So when a rhino's horn is poisoned, everyone is invited to watch in what Hern calls a “bush telegraph,” or the South African version of the “grapevine.”“The staff are invited to come out, local schools are invited to come out, community leaders, the chiefs of certain clans,” Hern says. “Everyone in South Africa has a cell phone, so they actively are encouraged to take as many pictures as they want on these treatment sites and to distribute the word.”No matter the method, Hern sees defending the rhino as her life’s mission. “I can much easier live with myself knowing that if rhinos still go extinct, it happened despite me and not because of me,"" she says. ""I would hate to look future generations in the eye and have them ask me, ‘Well what were you doing while rhinos went extinct?’ And to have to answer, ‘Well, nothing.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/salinger-write-nude/,a photograph shows author j.d. salinger writing at a nudist retreat.,False,"['j.d. salinger', ' miscaptioned', ' nudity']",http://www.biography.com/,http://www.biography.com/people/jd-salinger-9470070,2017/05/15,"Thanks for watching!Visit WebsiteDespite his apparent intellect, Salinger—or Sonny as he was known as child—wasn't much of a student. After flunking out of the McBurney School near his home in New York's Upper West Side, he was shipped off by his parents to Valley Forge Military Academy in Wayne, Pennsylvania.Aspiring WriterAfter graduating Valley Forge, Salinger returned to his hometown for one year to attend New York University before heading off to Europe, flush with some cash and encouragement from his father to learn another language and learn more about the import business. But Salinger, who spent the bulk of his five months overseas in Vienna, paid closer attention to language than business.Upon returning home, he made another attempt at college, this time at Ursinus College in Pennsylvania, before coming back to New York and taking night classes at Columbia University. There, Salinger met a Professor Whit Burnett, who would change his life.Burnett wasn't just a good teacher, he was also the editor of Story magazine, an influential publication that showcased short stories. Burnett, sensing Salinger's talent as a writer, pushed him to create more often and soon Salinger's work was appearing not just in Story, but in other big-name publications such as Collier's and the Saturday Evening Post.Military ServiceHis career had started to take off, but then, like so many young American men around this time, World War II interrupted his life. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Salinger was drafted into the army, serving from 1942-'44. His short military career saw him land at Utah Beach in France during the Normandy Invasion and be a part of the action at the Battle of the Bulge. During this time, however, Salinger continued to write, assembling chapters for a new novel whose main character was a deeply unsatisfied young man named Holden Caulfield.Salinger did not escape the war without some trauma, and when it ended he was hospitalized after suffering a nervous breakdown. The details about Salinger's stay at the hospital are shrouded in mystery, but it is clear that while undergoing care he met a woman named Sylvia, a German and possibly a former Nazi. The two married but their union was a short one, just eight months long. He married a second time in 1955 to Claire Douglas, the daughter of high profile British art critic Robert Langdon Douglas. The couple was together for a little more than a decade and had two children together, Margaret and Matthew.'The Catcher In the Rye'When Salinger returned to New York in 1946, he quickly set about resuming his life as a writer and soon found his work published in his favorite magazine, The New Yorker. He also continued to push on with the work on his novel. Finally, in 1951, The Catcher in the Rye was published.The book earned its share of positive reviews, but some critics weren't so kind. A few saw the main character of Caulfield and his quest for something pure in an otherwise ""phony"" world as promoting immoral views. But over time the American reading public ate the book up and The Catcher in the Rye became an integral part of academic literature curriculum. To date the book has sold more than 65 million copies.Along the way Caulfield has become as entrenched in the American psyche as much as any fictional character. Mark David Chapman, the man who assassinated John Lennon was found with a copy of the book at the time of his arrest and later explained that reason for the shooting could be found in the book's pages.Not surprisingly, Catcher vaulted Salinger to a level of unrivaled literary fame. For the young writer, who had fiercely boasted in college about his talents, the success he had seemingly craved early in life became something he ran away from once it came.Reclusive LifestyleIn 1953, two years after the publication of Catcher, Salinger pulled up stakes in New York City and retreated to a secluded, 90-acre place in Cornish, New Hampshire. There, Salinger did his best to cut-off contact with the public and significantly slowed his literary output.Two collections of his work, Franny and Zooey and Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters—all of which had appeared previously in The New Yorker—were published in book form in the early 1960s. In the June 19, 1965, edition of The New Yorker nearly the entire issue was dedicated to a new short story, the 25,000-word ""Hapworth 16, 1924."" To the dismay of many anxious readers, ""Hapworth"" was the last Salinger piece ever to be published while he was still alive.Personal Life and LegacyDespite Salinger's best efforts, not all of his life remained private. In 1966, Claire Douglas sued for divorce, reporting that if the relationship continued it ""would seriously injure her health and endanger her reason.""Six years later Salinger found himself in another relationship, this time with a college freshman named Joyce Maynard, whose story, ""An 18-Year-Old Looks Back on Life"" had appeared in The New York Times Magazine and caught the interest of the older writer.The two lived together in Cornish for 10 months before Salinger kicked her out. In 1998 Maynard wrote about her time with Salinger in a salacious memoir that painted a controlling and obsessive portrait of her former lover. A year later, Maynard auctioned off a series of letters Salinger had written her while they were still together. The letters fetched $156,500. The buyer, a computer programmer, later returned them to Salinger as a gift.In 2000, Salinger's daughter Margaret wrote an equally negative account of her father that like Maynard's earlier book was met with mixed reviews. For Salinger other relationships followed his affair with Maynard. For some time he dated the actress Ellen Joyce. Later he married a young nurse named Colleen O'Neill. The two were married up until his death on January 27, 2010, at his home in Cornish.Despite the lack of published work over the last four decades of his life, Salinger continued to write. Those who knew him said he worked every day and speculation swirled about the amount of work that he may have finished. One estimate claims that there may be as many as 10 finished novels locked away in his house.In 2013, new light was shed on Salinger's life and work. Shane Salerno and David Shields published a biography of the famed writer entitled Salinger. One of its revelations was that there were about five unpublished works by Salinger that are scheduled to be released over the next few years. Salerno also created a film documentary on Salinger, which debuted around the same time as his book with Shields.Fact CheckWe strive for accuracy and fairness.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/do-vegetarians-live-longer-than-meat-eaters/,vegetarians live longer than meat eaters.,Unproven,"['death', ' diet', ' health', ' meat', ' veganism', ' vegetarians']",http://ajcn.nutrition.org/,http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/103/1/218.full,2017/12/12,"Background: Vegetarians and others who do not eat meat have been observed to have lower incidence rates than meat eaters of some chronic diseases, but it is unclear whether this translates into lower mortality. Objective: The purpose of this study was to describe mortality in vegetarians and comparable nonvegetarians in a large United Kingdom cohort. Design: The study involved a pooled analysis of data from 2 prospective studies that included 60,310 persons living in the United Kingdom, comprising 18,431 regular meat eaters (who ate meat ≥5 times/wk on average), 13,039 low (less-frequent) meat eaters, 8516 fish eaters (who ate fish but not meat), and 20,324 vegetarians (including 2228 vegans who did not eat any animal foods). Mortality by diet group for each of 18 common causes of death was estimated with the use of Cox proportional hazards models. Results: There were 5294 deaths before age 90 in >1 million y of follow-up. There was no significant difference in overall (all-cause) mortality between the diet groups: HRs in low meat eaters, fish eaters, and vegetarians compared with regular meat eaters were 0.93 (95% CI: 0.86, 1.00), 0.96 (95% CI: 0.86, 1.06), and 1.02 (95% CI: 0.94, 1.10), respectively; P-heterogeneity of risks = 0.082. There were significant differences in risk compared with regular meat eaters for deaths from circulatory disease [higher in fish eaters (HR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.46)]; malignant cancer [lower in fish eaters (HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.70, 0.97)], including pancreatic cancer [lower in low meat eaters and vegetarians (HR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.36, 0.86 and HR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.28, 0.82, respectively)] and cancers of the lymphatic/hematopoietic tissue [lower in vegetarians (HR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.32, 0.79)]; respiratory disease [lower in low meat eaters (HR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.53, 0.92)]; and all other causes [lower in low meat eaters (HR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.99)]. Further adjustment for body mass index left these associations largely unchanged. Conclusions: United Kingdom–based vegetarians and comparable nonvegetarians have similar all-cause mortality. Differences found for specific causes of death merit further investigation. See corresponding editorial on page 3. Vegetarians are defined as people who do not eat any meat, poultry, or fish. They may be subclassified as lacto-ovo-vegetarians, who eat dairy products and/or eggs, and vegans, who do not eat any animal products. Others choose to limit their consumption of meat and fish, perhaps eating fish but not meat (often described as pesco-vegetarians) or eating meat infrequently (sometimes described as semivegetarians). Vegetarianism is uncommon in most countries, with <10% of the population following a vegetarian diet (1). For example, vegetarians and vegans have been estimated to constitute 5% and 2%, respectively, of the US population (2). In India, the proportion of the population consuming a vegetarian diet is much higher at almost 30% (3). These figures indicate that vegetarians and others who eat little or no meat represent a sizeable minority of the global population, and with calls for a reduction in the average worldwide consumption of animal products (4), their long-term health is a matter of considerable interest. Previous studies of mortality in vegetarians have not consistently shown a difference in overall mortality between vegetarians and comparable nonvegetarians (by which we mean persons from a similar background to vegetarians, including ethnicity and socioeconomic status, who eat meat and/or fish). For example, in a pooled analysis of 5 prospective studies, the death rate ratio in vegetarians compared with nonvegetarians, based on a total of 8330 deaths, was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.82, 1.11), albeit with significant heterogeneity of risks between studies (5). Further analyses of mortality data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)4–Oxford study (6) and Adventist Health Study 2 (AHS-2) (7), based on 1513 and 2570 deaths, respectively, produced inconsistent results (8, 9). In the EPIC-Oxford study, there was no difference in all-cause mortality between vegetarians and nonvegetarians (HR: 1.05; 95% CI: 0.93, 1.19), although the overall death rate was only one-half that of the United Kingdom population as a whole (8). In contrast, all-cause mortality in the AHS-2 was 12% (95% CI: 3, 20) lower in all vegetarians combined than in nonvegetarians (9). However, heterogeneity of risks between studies (5) and small numbers of deaths from specific causes have limited the ability of researchers to study relative mortality for many common causes of death. To provide more information on mortality in vegetarians and vegans, persons who eat fish but not meat, and infrequent meat eaters, we report here HRs for each of 18 common causes of death, including all causes combined. The analysis used pooled mortality data from 2 prospective studies in the United Kingdom, the Oxford Vegetarian Study (OVS) (10) and the EPIC-Oxford cohort (6), and included more than 5000 deaths before age 90. Thus, the present analysis mirrors a recent study of cancer incidence by diet group that used pooled data from the same 2 cohorts (11), while updating and extending the results from previous analyses of comparative mortality in United Kingdom-based vegetarians and nonvegetarians (8, 12). Participants in the OVS were recruited throughout the United Kingdom between 1980 and 1984 (10). Vegetarian participants were recruited through advertisements, the news media, and word of mouth. Nonvegetarian participants were recruited as friends and relatives of the vegetarian participants. In total, 11,140 subjects were recruited. At recruitment, participants completed a questionnaire on their diet and other lifestyle factors, including 4 questions on whether or not they consumed meat, fish, dairy products, and eggs, and 2 questions on the frequency of meat consumption. The EPIC-Oxford cohort was recruited throughout the United Kingdom between 1993 and 1999 (6). A multicenter research ethics committee (Scotland A Research Ethics Committee) approved the protocol. Two methods of recruitment were used: general practice (GP) recruitment and postal recruitment, as described elsewhere (6). In total, 7,421 participants were recruited by the GP method and 57,990 participants by the postal method. The recruitment questionnaire, which can be viewed online at http://www.epic-oxford.org, included 4 questions on whether or not participants consumed meat, fish, dairy products, and eggs, and questions on the frequency of meat consumption. Surviving participants were sent follow-up questionnaires approximately 5, 10, and 15 y after recruitment, including the same 4 questions on current intake of meat, fish, dairy products, and eggs and ≥1 questions on the frequency of meat consumption, enabling us to classify them according to diet group at each time point. The 5 y, 10 y, and 15 y follow-up questionnaires can also be viewed online at http://www.epic-oxford.org. For both studies, answers to the 4 questions on the consumption of meat, fish, dairy products, and eggs were used to assign participants to 1 of 4 diet groups at each time point [OVS recruitment, EPIC-Oxford recruitment, EPIC-Oxford follow-up questionnaire 1 (FU1), EPIC-Oxford follow-up questionnaire 2 (FU2), and EPIC-Oxford follow-up questionnaire 3 (FU3), as applicable]: meat eaters (participants who ate meat, irrespective of whether they ate fish, dairy products, or eggs), fish eaters (participants who did not eat meat but did eat fish), vegetarians (participants who did not eat meat or fish, but did eat either or both dairy products and eggs), and vegans (participants who did not eat meat, fish, eggs, or dairy products). Combining this information with data on the frequency of meat consumption enabled us to divide the meat eaters into regular meat eaters (who reported eating meat on ≥5 occasions per week on average) and low meat eaters (who ate meat <5 times/wk). Participants in both studies were followed until the censoring date of 31 March 2014 by record linkage with the United Kingdom’s National Health Service Central Register, which provides information on deaths and their causes. Person-years were calculated from the beginning of recruitment until the date of death, emigration, or loss to follow-up, the participant’s 90th birthday, or the censoring date, whichever occurred first. Participants in the OVS who subsequently joined the EPIC-Oxford study contributed person-years in the OVS until the date when they joined the EPIC-Oxford study. For EPIC-Oxford participants, the person-years were split into 1 to 4 phases depending on which, if any, of the follow-up questionnaires they completed. Diet group and categories of each of the adjustment and stratification variables were reset as appropriate at the beginning of each phase. For example, a participant who joined the OVS as a regular meat eater and had become a low meat eater at recruitment to the EPIC-Oxford study and a fish eater at FU1 completion would contribute person-years to each of these diet groups. The 18 common underlying causes of death for which HRs were calculated were as follows: malignant cancer [International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes C00–97 and equivalent ICD-9 codes], including colorectal cancer (ICD-10 C18–20), pancreatic cancer (C25), lung cancer (C34), female breast cancer (C50), ovarian cancer (C56), and cancers of the lymphatic/hematopoietic tissue (C81–96); mental and behavioral disorders (F00–99); diseases of the nervous system (G00–99); circulatory disease (I00–99), including ischemic heart disease (IHD) (I20–25), cerebrovascular disease (I60–69), and other circulatory disease (I00–15, I26–52, and I70–99); diseases of the respiratory system (J00–99); diseases of the digestive system (K00–93); injury, poisoning and external causes (S00–T98 and V01–Y98); all other causes (ICD-10 codes beginning with A, B, D, E, H, and L–R); and all causes combined. Participants were excluded from the analysis if they were aged <20 or >89 y at recruitment, or had a previous (registered or self-reported) malignant neoplasm before recruitment; a previous self-reported stroke, heart attack, or angina; uncertain follow-up; or had no information for ≥1 of the factors age, sex, smoking, and diet group at recruitment. EPIC-Oxford participants who did not complete the main questionnaire were also excluded because data on several important factors were thereby unavailable. After these exclusions, there were 60,310 participants (14,916 men and 45,394 women), including 10,359 OVS participants and 52,659 EPIC-Oxford participants; 2,708 participants contributed follow-up data from both studies. HRs (95% CIs) for 18 common causes of death, including all causes combined, were calculated by Cox proportional hazards regression with age as the underlying time variable, with the use of a clustered sandwich variance estimator to allow for intraparticipant correlation among individuals contributing person-years to >1 of the 5 possible phases of follow-up, including OVS recruitment to the earlier of EPIC-Oxford recruitment (if applicable) or death/censoring, EPIC-Oxford recruitment to the earliest of FU1/FU2/FU3 completion (if applicable) or death/censoring, FU1 completion (if applicable) to the earliest of FU2/FU3 completion (if applicable) or death/censoring, FU2 completion (if applicable) to the earlier of FU3 completion (if applicable) or death/censoring, and FU3 completion (if applicable) to death/censoring. For the small number of participants whose diet group was unknown at FU1, FU2, or FU3 completion (∼30 participants at each stage), diet group was deemed to be the same as at EPIC-Oxford recruitment or at the most-recently completed follow-up questionnaire, as appropriate. The analyses were stratified by study protocol (OVS participants, EPIC-Oxford GP-recruited participants, or EPIC-Oxford postal recruited participants), a 28-category variable combining sex; parity; oral contraceptive and hormone therapy use in women (men, plus the 27 combinations of nulliparous, parous, and unknown parity; never user, past or current user, and unknown user of oral contraceptives; and never user, past or current user, and unknown user of hormone therapy); self-reported prior diabetes (yes, no, or unknown); self-reported prior high blood pressure (yes, no, or unknown); and self-reported long-term medical treatment (yes, no, or unknown). HRs also were adjusted for smoking (never smoker; former smoker; current smoker of 1–9, 10–19, or ≥20 cigarettes/d; other current smoker, including pipe and cigar smokers; or unknown); alcohol consumption (<1, 1–7, 8–15, or ≥16 g ethanol/d or unknown); physical activity [low, high, or unknown; for OVS, high means sport/keep fit and/or running/cycling ≥2 times/wk, and low means neither of these (where known); for EPIC-Oxford, low means an average of <3.5 h/wk cycling or other physical exercise, and high means more than this (where known)]; marital status (married or cohabiting, not married or cohabiting, or unknown); and regular use of nutritional supplements (yes, no, or unknown), with optional further adjustment for BMI (in kg/m2; <18, 18–19.9, 20–21.9, 22–23.9, 24–25.9, 26–27.9, 28–29.9, 30–32.4, or ≥32.5, or unknown). In the main analysis of mortality before age 90 y, the meat eaters were divided into 2 categories according to the average frequency of meat consumption, whereas the vegetarians and vegans were combined into a single group, creating 4 diet groups: regular meat eaters (who reported eating meat ≥5 times/wk on average), low meat eaters (who ate meat but did so <5 times/wk), fish eaters, and vegetarians and vegans. For the 6 most common causes of death (malignant cancer, circulatory disease, IHD, cerebrovascular disease, diseases of the respiratory system, and all causes combined), subgroup analyses were also conducted for men; women; participants with BMI <20 (underweight), BMI 20–24.9 (normal weight), and BMI ≥25 (overweight); never smokers, former smokers and current smokers; and after excluding the first 2 y of follow-up in either the OVS or EPIC-Oxford study according to which study participants joined first. We also conducted the mortality analyses for all 18 causes of death after excluding participants known to have changed diet group at least once during follow-up, including participants common to the OVS and EPIC-Oxford study who were in a different diet group at recruitment to the 2 studies. For the 6 most common causes of death only, we also calculated HRs with the vegetarians and vegans separated to give results for 5 diet groups (regular meat eaters, low meat eaters, fish eaters, vegetarians, and vegans). We also examined mortality before age 75 y in the model for the 4 diet groups for 17 causes of death (there were too few deaths from mental and behavioral disorders before age 75 for meaningful analysis), censoring at participants’ 75th birthday if this preceded their censoring date or date of death, emigration, or other loss to follow-up, repeating this analysis after excluding participants known to have changed diet group at least once during follow-up. The main results were not adjusted for BMI because we consider that the differences in BMI between the dietary groups are largely caused by the differences in diet, and, therefore, that BMI may mediate some of the differences in risk between dietary groups, but we do report the effects on the HR of further adjustment for BMI (in 10 categories, including unknown, as listed above). Chi-square tests of heterogeneity of risk between the diet groups were based on the statistical significance of diet group in the model, the null hypothesis being equality of risk across the 4 (or 5) diet groups. Tests of heterogeneity of risks by diet group between men and women and categories of BMI and smoking were based on the statistical significance of the corresponding interaction term in the model. Statistical significance was set at the 5% level. All statistical analyses were conducted with the use of Stata Statistical Software: Release 14. The characteristics of the participants in each of 4 diet groups (regular meat eaters, low meat eaters, fish eaters, and vegetarians and vegans combined) are shown in Table 1. To avoid double counting, persons who participated in both the OVS and EPIC-Oxford study are grouped according to their characteristics at recruitment to the EPIC-Oxford study. One-third of participants were vegetarian or vegan and three-quarters were women. Two-thirds of the vegetarians and vegans had followed their diet for more than 5 y (results not shown), and 59% of meat eaters ate meat ≥5 times/wk on average. Mean age at recruitment was lower in the fish eaters than in the meat eaters, and lower still in the vegetarians and vegans. Smoking rates were low overall, with only 16% of men and 12% of women reporting that they were smokers at the time of recruitment. Mean BMI was ∼2 kg/m2 lower in vegetarians and vegans than in regular meat eaters and the proportion with a BMI <20 was 2–3 times as high in the former group as in the latter. Fish eaters had a slightly higher mean BMI than did the vegetarians and vegans. Mean alcohol consumption was lowest in the vegetarians and vegans and highest in fish eaters (women) or regular meat eaters (men). The proportions of men and women who reported a relatively high amount of physical activity were highest in fish eaters and lowest in regular meat eaters. About two-thirds of participants were married or cohabiting at recruitment, the proportion being highest in regular meat eaters and lowest in vegetarians and vegans. The proportions of men and women who reported regular use of nutritional supplements were highest in fish eaters and lowest in regular meat eaters, with more than one-third of men and more than one-half of women taking supplements. The proportion of women who were nulliparous at recruitment was highest among vegetarians and vegans and lowest among regular meat eaters, and the proportion of women who had ever used oral contraceptives was highest in fish eaters and lowest in regular meat eaters. Less than 2% of participants reported a previous diagnosis of diabetes, the percentages being highest in regular meat eaters and lowest in vegetarians and vegans; a similar pattern was found for self-reported prior high blood pressure and long-term medical treatment, except that the percentages were closer to 10% and 20%, respectively. Values are means ± SDs or percentages. Persons who participated in both the Oxford Vegetarian Study and EPIC-Oxford are grouped according to their characteristics at recruitment to EPIC-Oxford. EPIC-Oxford, European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition–Oxford. Includes pipe or cigar smokers and current smokers of an unknown number of cigarettes per day.

Values are means ± SDs or percentages. Persons who participated in both the Oxford Vegetarian Study and EPIC-Oxford are grouped according to their characteristics at recruitment to EPIC-Oxford. EPIC-Oxford, European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition–Oxford. Includes pipe or cigar smokers and current smokers of an unknown number of cigarettes per day. Known for 14,441 men and 43,951 women. In 11,625 men and 39,936 women in the EPIC-Oxford study with reliable nutrient intake data. As a nonstarch polysaccharide. The estimated mean intake of selected foods and nutrients by diet group is also shown in Table 1. Because the OVS recruitment questionnaire was insufficiently detailed to enable nutrient intake to be estimated, the values are based on data from the EPIC-Oxford study only. Expressed as a percentage of energy intake, intake of protein, total fat, and saturated fat was highest in regular meat eaters and lowest in vegetarians and vegans, whereas the reverse was true for intake of carbohydrate, dietary fiber, and plant protein. Meat intake was >3 times higher in regular meat eaters than in low meat eaters (∼110 g/d and ∼35 g/d, respectively), whereas total fish intake was ∼40 g/d in each of the nonvegetarian groups, about one-third of which was oily fish. Intake of fresh fruit and vegetables was lowest in regular meat eaters and generally highest in vegetarians and vegans, although the differences between the highest and lowest mean intake was only ∼50 g/d. Of the 2708 persons who participated in both the OVS and EPIC-Oxford study, 1839 (68%) were allocated to the same diet group (regular meat eater, low meat eater, fish eater, or vegetarian or vegan) at recruitment to both studies, with an average 13 y gap between recruitment dates, indicating a high degree of consistency in diet group. Of the 52,659 EPIC-Oxford participants included in the analysis, 34,983 completed FU1 ∼5 y after recruitment and could be characterized according to diet group at this time. Of these, 25,555 (73%) were allocated to the same diet group (regular meat eater, low meat eater, fish eater, or vegetarian or vegan) as they had been at recruitment. There were 5294 deaths before age 90 among the participants in >1 million years of follow-up. Table 2 shows the HR for low meat eaters, fish eaters, and vegetarians and vegans combined relative to regular meat eaters for the 18 causes of death investigated, each of which was responsible for more than 130 deaths before age 90, without and with additional adjustment for BMI. For all causes of death combined, there was no significant difference in risk between diet groups [low meat eaters, HR: 0.93 (95% CI: 0.86, 1.00); fish eaters, HR: 0.96 (95% CI: 0.86, 1.06); and vegetarians and vegans, HR: 1.02 (95% CI: 0.94, 1.10) compared with regular meat eaters; P-heterogeneity of risks = 0.082]. There was significant heterogeneity of risk between diet groups for deaths from pancreatic cancer [low meat eaters, HR: 0.55 (95% CI: 0.36, 0.86) and vegetarians and vegans, HR: 0.48 (95% CI 0.28, 0.82), compared with regular meat eaters; P-heterogeneity = 0.012] and cancers of the lymphatic/hematopoietic tissue [vegetarians and vegans compared with regular meat eaters, HR: 0.50 (95% CI: 0.32, 0.79); P-heterogeneity = 0.010]. Mortality from all malignant cancers combined was significantly lower in fish eaters than in regular meat eaters, HR: 0.82 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.97). There was also significant heterogeneity of risk between diet groups for circulatory disease mortality [fish eaters compared with regular meat eaters, HR: 1.22 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.46); P-heterogeneity = 0.046]; cerebrovascular disease mortality (P-heterogeneity = 0.023, but no significant differences in risk between regular meat eaters and any of the other diet groups); and respiratory disease mortality [low meat eaters compared with regular meat eaters, HR: 0.70 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.92); P-heterogeneity = 0.020]. Mortality from all other causes (ICD-10 codes beginning with A, B, D, E, H, and L–R) was significantly lower in low meat eaters than in regular meat eaters (HR: 0.74 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.99), although there was no overall heterogeneity of risk between the diet groups for this endpoint (P-heterogeneity = 0.13). Further adjustment for BMI left these associations largely unchanged, except that the higher mortality from other circulatory disease in fish eaters compared with regular meat eaters became statistically significant (HR: 1.45 (95% CI: 1.03, 2.03); P-heterogeneity = 0.20). Estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression with age as the underlying time variable. Basic model adjusted for smoking (never smoker; former smoker; current smoker of 1–9, 10–19, or ≥20 cigarettes per day; other current smoker; unknown); alcohol consumption (<1, 1–7, 8–15, or ≥16 g ethanol/d or unknown); physical activity (low, high, or unknown); whether married or cohabiting (yes, no, or unknown); and regular use of nutritional supplements (no, yes, or unknown), and stratified by study/method of recruitment (Oxford Vegetarian Study, EPIC-Oxford postal, or EPIC-Oxford general practice); all possible combinations of sex, parity (nulliparous, parous, or unknown), oral contraceptive use, and hormone therapy use (both ever, never, or unknown); prior diabetes; prior high blood pressure; and receipt of long-term medical treatment (each no, yes, or unknown), with the use of separate models for each endpoint. Model +BMI is further adjusted for BMI (in kg/m2; <18, 18.0–19.9, 20.0–21.9, 22.0–23.9, 24.0–25.9, 26.0–27.9, 28.0–29.9, 30.0–32.4, or ≥32.5, or unknown).

Model +BMI is further adjusted for BMI (in kg/m2; <18, 18.0–19.9, 20.0–21.9, 22.0–23.9, 24.0–25.9, 26.0–27.9, 28.0–29.9, 30.0–32.4, or ≥32.5, or unknown). EPIC-Oxford, European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition–Oxford; het, heterogeneity; ICD, International Classification of Diseases. Chi-square test of heterogeneity of risk between the 4 diet groups. With 2 exceptions, there was no significant heterogeneity of risks between men and women; between never, former, and current smokers; or between low-weight, normal-weight, and overweight participants for any of the 6 most common causes of death (malignant cancer, circulatory disease, IHD, cerebrovascular disease, diseases of the respiratory system, and all causes combined) for which subgroup analyses were performed (results not shown). The exceptions were circulatory disease mortality subdivided by BMI category (P-interaction = 0.030), for which there was significant heterogeneity of risks between diet groups for participants with BMI ≥25 [fish eaters, HR: 1.53 (95% CI: 1.13, 2.08), and vegetarians and vegans, HR: 1.28 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.64) compared with regular meat eaters; P-heterogeneity = 0.015] but not for participants with BMI <20 or 20–24.9; and respiratory disease mortality subdivided by smoking status (P-interaction = 0.047), for which there was significant heterogeneity of risks between diet groups for never smokers [vegetarians and vegans compared with regular meat eaters, HR: 1.53 (95% CI: 1.00, 2.37); P-heterogeneity = 0.024], but not for former smokers or current smokers. When the first 2 y of follow-up were excluded, leaving 5133 deaths before age 90, there was significant heterogeneity of risk between the diet groups for all causes of death combined, as follows: low meat eaters, HR: 0.94 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.01); fish eaters, HR: 0.96 (95% CI: 0.86, 1.06); and vegetarians and vegans, HR: 1.05 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.13) compared with regular meat eaters; P-heterogeneity = 0.035. The heterogeneity of risks for circulatory disease, cerebrovascular disease and respiratory disease mortality all remained statistically significant (P-heterogeneity = 0.040, 0.021, and 0.016, respectively; HRs not shown). Further adjustment for BMI left these associations largely unchanged except that the heterogeneity of risk between the diet groups for all causes of death after excluding the first 2 y of follow-up was no longer statistically significant (P-heterogeneity = 0.10; HRs not shown). When we excluded data for participants known to have changed diet group at least once during follow-up, leaving data for 4270 deaths before age 90, there was no significant difference in risk between diet groups for all causes of death combined, as follows: low meat eaters, HR: 0.93 (95% CI: 0.85, 1.02); fish eaters, HR: 0.91 (95% CI: 0.81, 1.02); and vegetarians and vegans, HR: 0.92 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.99) compared with regular meat eaters; P-heterogeneity = 0.13 (Table 3). There was significant heterogeneity of risk between the diet groups for mortality from all malignant cancers combined and cancers of the lymphatic/hematopoietic tissue (P-heterogeneity = 0.006 and 0.001, respectively). For all malignant cancers, both fish eaters and vegetarians and vegans combined had significantly lower mortality than regular meat eaters [HR: 0.76 (95% CI: 0.63, 0.91) and HR: 0.82 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.94), respectively]. Vegetarians and vegans combined also had significantly lower mortality than did regular meat eaters for pancreatic cancer [HR: 0.47 (95% CI: 0.26, 0.86); P-heterogeneity = 0.065] and cancers of the lymphatic/hematopoietic tissue [HR: 0.43 (95% CI: 0.27, 0.70)], and low meat eaters had significantly lower respiratory disease mortality than regular meat eaters [HR: 0.69 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.97); P-heterogeneity = 0.14]. Further adjustment for BMI left these associations largely unchanged except that the heterogeneity of risk between the diet groups for deaths from pancreatic cancer became statistically significant (P-heterogeneity = 0.029), with low meat eaters and vegetarians and vegans both having significantly lower pancreatic cancer mortality than regular meat eaters [HR: 0.55 (95% CI: 0.30, 0.98) and HR: 0.42 (95% CI: 0.23, 0.77), respectively].

Chi-square test of heterogeneity of risk between the 4 diet groups. For 6 major causes of death (including all causes combined), vegetarians and vegans were separated and HRs compared with regular meat eaters were calculated for each of low meat eaters, fish eaters, vegetarians, and vegans (Table 4). For all causes of death, there was no significant difference in risk between diet groups as follows: low meat eaters, HR: 0.93 (95% CI: 0.86, 1.00); fish eaters, HR: 0.96 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.06); vegetarians, HR: 1.00 (95% CI: 0.93, 1.08); and vegans, HR: 1.14 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.35) compared with regular meat eaters; P-heterogeneity = 0.056. There was significant heterogeneity of risk between diet groups for cerebrovascular disease and respiratory disease mortality (P-heterogeneity = 0.023 and 0.015, respectively), with vegans having the highest mortality for both of these causes of death [compared with regular meat eaters, HR: 1.63 (95% CI: 0.98, 2.69) and HR: 1.57 (95% CI: 0.92, 2.67), respectively], but the CIs for the HRs in vegans were wide, precluding any clear conclusions. Further adjustment for BMI made little difference to the results. When we repeated this analysis after excluding data for participants known to have changed diet group at least once during follow-up, there was significant heterogeneity of risks between diet groups for malignant cancer mortality alone (P-heterogeneity = 0.015; results not shown). HRs for vegans compared with regular meat eaters for deaths from malignant cancer, circulatory disease, IHD, cerebrovascular disease, diseases of the respiratory system, and all causes combined were HR: 0.97 (95% CI: 0.72, 1.29); HR: 1.09 (95% CI: 0.76, 1.56); HR: 0.79 (95% CI: 0.44, 1.43); HR: 1.50 (95% CI: 0.84, 2.68); HR: 1.00 (95% CI: 0.50, 2.01); and HR: 1.00 (95% CI: 0.83, 1.20), respectively.

EPIC-Oxford, European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition–Oxford; het, heterogeneity; ICD, International Classification of Diseases. Chi-square test of heterogeneity of risk between the 5 diet groups. We also examined mortality before age 75 for the categorization with 4 diet groups including vegetarians and vegans combined. There were 2601 deaths before age 75 among the participants up to the censoring date. The HRs for low meat eaters, fish eaters, and vegetarians and vegans combined relative to regular meat eaters for 17 causes of death are shown in Supplemental Table 1 (mental and behavioral disorders were responsible for only 18 deaths before age 75—too few for meaningful analysis). For all-cause mortality before age 75, there was no significant difference in risk between diet groups: HRs for low meat eaters, fish eaters, and vegetarians and vegans compared with regular meat eaters were HR: 0.92 (95% CI: 0.83, 1.01); HR: 0.90 (95% CI: 0.78, 1.04); and HR: 0.97 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.08), respectively; P-heterogeneity = 0.28. Significant heterogeneity of risks between the diet groups was found for pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, and cancers of the lymphatic/hematopoietic tissue, and malignant cancer mortality was significantly lower in fish eaters than in regular meat eaters (Supplemental Table 1). Again, further adjustment for BMI made little difference to the results. When we excluded data for participants known to have changed diet group at least once during follow-up from the early mortality analysis, leaving data for 2155 deaths before age 75, vegetarians and vegans had significantly lower all-cause mortality than regular meat eaters, although there was no overall heterogeneity of risk between the diet groups: HRs for low meat eaters, fish eaters, and vegetarians and vegans compared with regular meat eaters were HR: 0.97 (95% CI: 0.86, 1.09); HR: 0.87 (95% CI: 0.74, 1.02); and HR: 0.86 (95% CI: 0.77, 0.97), respectively; P-heterogeneity = 0.068 (Supplemental Table 2). There was significant heterogeneity of risk between the diet groups for mortality from all malignant cancers combined, cancers of the lung and lymphatic/hematopoietic tissue, and other circulatory disease. In addition, vegetarians and vegans had significantly lower mortality than regular meat eaters for pancreatic cancer and digestive diseases, and fish eaters had significantly lower colorectal cancer mortality than regular meat eaters (Supplemental Table 2). Further adjustment for BMI left these associations largely unchanged. In this analysis of mortality by diet group in a population with a high percentage of vegetarians and others who eat little or no meat, we found no significant differences in all-cause mortality between the diet groups. For specific causes of death, compared with regular meat eaters, low meat eaters had ∼30–45% lower mortality from pancreatic cancer, respiratory disease, and all other causes of death, fish eaters had ∼20% lower mortality from malignant cancer and ∼20% higher circulatory disease mortality, and vegetarians and vegans had ∼50% lower mortality from pancreatic cancer and cancers of the lymphatic/hematopoietic tissue. These findings were essentially unchanged on further adjustment for BMI, and generally were robust across categories of sex, smoking, and BMI for the 6 most common causes of death. When we excluded data for participants known to have changed diet group at least once during follow-up (on the basis that a change in diet group could be prompted by the onset of illness), compared with regular meat eaters, low meat eaters had ∼45% lower mortality from pancreatic cancer and ∼30% lower respiratory disease mortality, fish eaters had ∼25% lower mortality from malignant cancer, and vegetarians and vegans had ∼10% lower all-cause mortality, ∼20% lower mortality from malignant cancer, and ∼50–60% lower mortality from pancreatic cancer and cancers of the lymphatic/hematopoietic tissue. Separating the vegetarians and vegans for the 6 most common causes of death did not reveal any statistically significant differences in mortality between vegans and regular meat eaters. When we censored the data to study mortality before age 75, the results were broadly similar to those for mortality to age 90. Our results for all-cause mortality are in line with previous studies of mortality in United Kingdom-based vegetarians and comparable nonvegetarians (5, 8, 12). In contrast, recent results from the AHS-2 study found that all-cause mortality was 12% (95% CI: 3, 20) lower in all vegetarians combined (including occasional meat eaters and persons who ate fish but not meat) than in nonvegetarians (9), and earlier studies of US Seventh-Day Adventists also found lower all-cause mortality in vegetarians (5). Orlich et al. (9) considered possible reasons for this apparent discrepancy in findings between US-based Seventh-Day Adventists and United Kingdom-based free-living subjects, suggesting that the “perceived healthfulness of vegetarian diets” may be a major motivating factor for Adventist vegetarians, whereas United Kingdom vegetarians may be motivated by other factors that are not health-related, making them less likely to adopt a “healthy” vegetarian diet (13). It may also be the case that differences in the dietary characteristics of vegetarians and nonvegetarians are greater among Adventists than among the participants in our studies. For example, nonvegetarians in the AHS-2 had 2.6 times the intake of animal protein (expressed as a percentage of energy intake) as lacto-ovo-vegetarians in the same study (14), rather higher than the ratio of 2.1 between the animal protein intake of regular meat eaters and vegetarians and vegans in the present study (Table 1). Whether such variations in diet between vegetarians and nonvegetarians in the United States and the United Kingdom contribute to the differences in all-cause mortality between vegetarians and nonvegetarians in the AHS-2 and between regular meat eaters and vegetarians in the present study is unclear. We found no difference in IHD mortality between diet groups. This contrasts with results from the AHS-2, which showed significantly lower IHD mortality in fish eaters than in nonvegetarians (who ate meat and fish more than once per week; HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.43, 0.97) (9), and an earlier EPIC-Oxford study showing a 32% (95% CI: 19, 42) lower risk of incident IHD (including 1235 mostly nonfatal IHD events) in vegetarians than in nonvegetarians (15). The most likely explanation for the finding of a lower risk of incident IHD in vegetarians is that vegetarians have generally lower values of established risk factors for IHD (namely, non-HDL cholesterol, blood pressure, and BMI) than do nonvegetarians (16), but why this finding is not replicated for IHD mortality is unclear. The IHD risk factors that are affected by consuming a vegetarian diet are, proportionally, more strongly related to the risk of IHD at younger ages (17), which might explain our finding of a larger (but nonsignificant) difference in IHD mortality between regular meat eaters and vegetarians before age 75 y than for mortality up to age 90 y. Incident, nonfatal IHD may also lead to the effective medical management of established risk factors for IHD (e.g., drugs to treat non-HDL cholesterol and high blood pressure), lowering subsequent IHD mortality and partially nullifying the differences between vegetarians and meat eaters found for IHD incidence. In our analysis of cancer incidence in British vegetarians, based on data from the same 2 cohort studies, we found an ∼10% significantly lower incidence of all malignant cancers in fish eaters and vegetarians (including vegans) than in meat eaters (11). In the present study, fish eaters had a significant ∼20% lower malignant cancer mortality than did regular meat eaters, whereas vegetarians and vegans had a nonsignificantly lower cancer mortality than regular meat eaters (by ∼10%), so our findings are consistent with the results for overall cancer incidence. In the AHS-2, there was no difference in cancer mortality between vegetarians and nonvegetarians (9). The lower mortality for pancreatic cancer and cancers of the lymphatic/hematopoietic tissue in vegetarians and vegans compared with regular meat eaters partially reflects the findings from our analysis of cancer incidence in British vegetarians (11). Although data from the EPIC study as a whole found no association between intakes of red and processed meat and pancreatic cancer risk, poultry consumption was associated with an increased risk (18), and a meta-analysis of 11 prospective studies found a positive association between pancreatic cancer incidence and processed meat consumption (19). We also found significant heterogeneity of risks between the diet groups for circulatory disease, cerebrovascular disease, and respiratory disease mortality, although there were no obvious patterns to the HRs and the heterogeneity was nonsignificant for mortality before age 75 y. Similarly, the ∼25% lower mortality from all other causes (a catch-all category in which the most common cause of death is old age) in low meat eaters compared with regular meat eaters is hard to explain. Strengths of the study include the large numbers of deaths (5294, including 2601 before age 75 y) in >1 million years of follow-up and the inclusion of many actual and potential confounders among the variables used for stratification and adjustment. There was also a high degree of consistency of diet group during follow-up, both among EPIC-Oxford study participants who completed the first follow-up questionnaire ∼5 y after recruitment and among the 2708 participants who contributed follow-up data from both studies. Limitations of the study include the simple adjustment for physical activity and the uneven distribution of participants by sex (three-quarters of participants were women). The study participants are not representative of the United Kingdom population, but the mean intake of red meat in our reference group of regular meat eaters (84 g/d in men and 70 g/d in women) are similar to those of adults aged 19–64 y in the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey (86 g/d in men and 56 g/d in women) (20). In conclusion, our results suggest that United Kingdom–based vegetarians and comparable nonvegetarians (including people who eat fish but not meat and those who eat meat <5 times per week on average) have similar all-cause mortality. The differences by diet group found for specific causes of death merit further investigation.

Providers of these services often use phone numbers with area codes in the 900s, and callers either pay an additional charge per-call or are billed at a per-minute rate higher than normal phone calls. Toll-free numbers, such as 800, 888 and 877, can also be used for pay-per-call services, including certain directory services or services for which users have a prior payment or subscription arrangement. You and the company offering 800 number services have entered into a written agreement that includes: The amount you will be charged for each call. The information service provider’s name, business address and phone number. A unique PIN or a security device to prevent unauthorized charges to your account. The amount you will be charged for each call. The information service provider’s name, business address and phone number. A unique PIN or a security device to prevent unauthorized charges to your account. You are charged for the information through a credit, prepaid, debit, charge or calling card. Before you can be charged for a call to an 800 number, the service provider must provide an introductory message telling you: There is a charge for the call. The service provider’s total cost per minute and any other fees. Charges will be billed on a credit, prepaid, debit, charge or calling card, and your card number must be provided. Charges for the call will begin at the end of the introductory message. You can hang up during the introductory message or at the end of the introductory message and will not be charged for the call.

You can hang up during the introductory message or at the end of the introductory message and will not be charged for the call. If you call a toll-free number, the information service provider cannot connect you automatically to a 900 number service or call you back collect. No written agreement is required for you to be charged when calling an 800 number for directory services, for the purchase of other goods and services, or for using devices that provide telecommunications services to those with hearing or speech disabilities. Charges for 900 pay-per-call and 800 number information services should be displayed in a section of your telephone bill that is clearly separate from your local and long distance telephone charges. For each call made to a pay-per-call service, information regarding the type of service, the amount of the charge, the date and time of day and length of the call must be indicated. Information service providers must notify their customers at least one billing cycle prior to making any changes in their charges or terms of service. Your telephone company cannot disconnect your local or long distance service for nonpayment of disputed 900 or 800 number charges. However, your telephone company can block you from making calls to 900 numbers if you do not pay legitimate 900 number charges. In most areas, you can ask your local telephone company to block 900-number dialing from your phone. The company must do so at no charge if you make the request within 60 days of beginning new telephone service. The company can charge a reasonable one-time fee if you ask for blocking outside the 60-day period. If you decide to remove the 900 number dialing block, your request to your local telephone company must be in writing. If you have a complaint regarding a 900 or 800 number service, first try to resolve it with the service provider or the billing company. If you can’t resolve it directly, you can file a complaint with the FCC. There is no charge for filing a complaint.

They steal our very humanity.Systemic and institutionalized racism are the defining civil rights and social justice issues of our time. We’ve come to understand that to be silent about the violence and threats to the lives and well-being of Black people is to be complicit in that violence and those threats. We ask you to join us in not being complicit.There is good news: the first step in overcoming systemic racism and injustice is to simply understand and admit that there is a problem. It’s trying to understand the perspective of others whose experiences are different from our own. To not just listen, but to truly understand those whose struggle for justice is real, and not yet complete.Rev. Dr. William J. Barber, II, President of the North Carolina NAACP, said it best when reacting to the recent police shooting in Charlotte, NC. He said, “Our objective is simple: to ensure justice-loving people act toward justice, with all evidence, and that we stand together and act from a place of power and love, rather than out of fear and anger.”It’s been hard to watch the list of unarmed Black Americans killed by law enforcement officers grow longer and longer. We understand that numerous Black Americans and white Americans have profoundly different experiences and outcomes with law enforcement and the criminal justice system. That’s why it’s become clear to us at Ben & Jerry’s that we have a moral obligation to take a stand now for justice and for Black lives.We want to be clear: we believe that saying Black lives matter is not to say that the lives of those who serve in the law enforcement community don’t. We respect and value the commitment to our communities that those in law enforcement make, and we respect the value of every one of their lives.But we do believe that — whether Black, brown, white, or blue — our nation and our very way of life is dependent on the principle of all people being served equal justice under the law. And it’s clear, the effects of the criminal justice system are not color blind.We do not place the blame for this on individual officers. Rather, we believe it is due to the systemic racism built into the fabric of our institutions at every level, disadvantaging and discriminating against people of color in ways that go beyond individual intent to discriminate. For this reason, we are not pointing fingers at individuals; we are instead urging us to come together to better our society and institutions so that we may finally fulfill the founding promise of this country: to be a country with dignity and justice for all.All lives do matter. But all lives will not matter until Black lives matter.We ask people to be open to understanding these issues, and not to reflexively retreat to our current beliefs. Change happens when people are willing to listen and hear the struggles of their neighbor, putting aside preconceived notions and truly seeking to understand and grow. We’ll be working hard on that, and ask you to as well.- Your friends at Ben & Jerry’s",2016/10/06,snopes,0
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/fascism-corporations-corporatism-dictionary/,"merriam-webster changed its dictionary definition of ""fascism"" in 1987, to censor links between its new corporate owner and fascists.",False,"['corporations', ' fascism', ' history', ' mussolini']",http://blog.skepticallibertarian.com/,http://blog.skepticallibertarian.com/2013/02/07/fake-quote-files-mussolini-on-fascism-and-corporatism/,2018/04/27,"Here at The Skeptical Libertarian, we are frequently asked to track down and verify unsourced quotes attributed to Founding Fathers, ex-presidents, world leaders, and other historical figures. Facebook and Reddit have made the fake quote-picture a staple of online discussions, but there is a long and ignoble history of misquoting famous people to suit contemporary agendas.A good rule of thumb is that if a quote is a) unsourced, and b) sounds suspiciously like a modern political talking point, you should be skeptical of it. (Another good rule is that anything attributed to John F. Kennedy and dated by its proximity to his death e.g., Ten days before his assassination!, A weeks before he was shot! is almost definitely bogus.)While the internet has made it much easier to spread fabricated quotes, it has also made it much easier for the skeptically-minded to verify or debunk them. While some primary documents are not yet available online, it is increasingly easy to trace the origin of quotes online, thanks to Google Scholar, Google Books, or if you have access to a university library system.Generally, if an original document doesnt turn up in the first few pages of a search, none exists. But this is not always the case, particularly when the citation is to an obscure publication or a document in a foreign language. One such quotation that has proved incredibly difficult to verify is this one, allegedly from the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini:Fascism should more properly be called corporatism, since it is the merger of state and corporate power.The quote has been widely circulated on internet forums, after being popularized by Aaron Russos conspiracist documentary America: Freedom to Fascism. But there is simply no evidence that Mussolini ever said this. The first print source I could find was from Michael C. Rupperts 2004 book Crossing the Rubicon: The Decline of the American Empire at the End of the Age of Oil almost 60 years after Mussolini died.It has also been proposed that the original author was the Italian fascist philosopher Giovanni Gentile, but no source confirms this citation. Some possible Italian sources for Rupperts misquotation are found in Alessandro Sommas voluminous book The Legal and Cultural Rome-Berlin Axis: Economics and Politics in Fascist and Nazi Law.Somma summarizes Mussolinis thoughts on the relationship between the corporative system and the fascist state, which, roughly translated, reads:The corporative regime, typical creation and legitimate pride of the fascist revolution, the cornerstone of the fascist State, which is corporate or is not fascist, was made, if not already, the doctrine, the doctrine of inspiration since December of 21.The two phrases in quotation marks come from two different speeches from Mussolini, one in 1926 and one at the inaugural session of the Assembly of the National Council of Corporations in 1930. Somma does make clear that Mussolini thought corporatism was the foundation of the fascist system, much like Rupperts quote seems to suggest.It doesnt.But his interpretation of Mussolini and what he leads readers of his book to believe is fundamentally flawed and rooted in misconceptions about what corporatism meant. In his rambling tirade against George Bush, Ruppert states that corporativism is identical to fascism which is identical to corporate welfare. Hence, he felt justified in saying that Mussolini thought fascism was the merger of state and corporate power.Theres a lot wrong with this idea, beginning with the confused claim that fascism and corporativism were the same thing, when Il Duce himself makes clear they are quite separate concepts, with corporatism being a necessary feature of a fascist state. But more seriously, Ruppert thinks corporations mean modern limited liability companies (what we today mean by corporations), and that these business entities merge with or take over the state and use it for their own benefit.This is just plain wrong, and it demonstrates why this quote is not just false but misleading. Corporations were not individual businesses. Under fascist corporatism, sectors of the economy were divided into corporate groups, whose activities and interactions were managed and coordinated by the government. The idea was to split the difference between socialism and laissez faire capitalism, letting the state control and direct the economy from the top-down without itself owning the means of production.Commander in Chief of the Italian economy.The National Council of Corporations was the government body in charge of managing Italys economy, and membership included representatives from labor unions, employers, public sector workers, government ministries, and social groups. Special committees would plan the technical details of specific policies. At its inauguration, Mussolini stated, The [NCC] is to the Italian economy what the Chief of Staff is to the Army: the thinking brain that prepares and coordinates.The idea was that this body would negotiate contracts and centrally plan production throughout the economy, regulating the sectors of art, industry, agriculture, trade, comm-unication, transportation, and finance thus settling disputes, producing social harmony, and generating economic efficiency. In reality, it did none of this, and the system was used for rent-seeking, and to reward friends and crush enemies of the government.The bottom line is that corporate groups meant classes of people in the economy, which were allegedly represented through appointments to the Council. The system was not about welfare for private companies, but rather about totalitarian central planning of the whole economy through legislation and regulation. Corporatism meant formally incorporating divergent interests under the state, which would resolve their differences through regulatory mechanisms.Economic fascism was direct state control and planning of the economy, not subsidies or special favors dished out by politicians in a democracy to businesses in an otherwise free market, which is what people in the United States mean by corporatism today. Fascism was not a business takeover of government but rather the opposite, and the fact that Ruppert is ignorant of what corporate bodies were and the structure of the corporative system makes me suspect he either made up the quote or doesnt understand its historical context.Update: PublicEye.org has offered a reward for anyone who can provide an original source for this quote. It appears the quote predates Rupperts book, and it has been in circulation on the internet since at least 1998.",2013/02/07,snopes,0

In fact, France has just passed a law that made it far easier to charge adults who had sex with children under 15 with rape. It has strengthened its consent laws, not weakened them.Yet Collins asked Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to ""denounce this legislation of child sexual abuse"".The article said France was the latest nation to ""give into pressure from an international network of liberal activists determined to normalise paedophilia and decriminalise sex with children"" by ""abandonment"" of its age of consent laws.READ MORE:France had already made sex with any children younger than 15 an offence, but it did not automatically classify all such sex as rape - neither does New Zealand.Another article on YourNewsWire, which is widely cited as a fake news site.The new law makes it far easier for prosecutors to do so by introducing a new offence of ""abuse of vulnerability"". Critics have argued that the new law does not go far enough, but not that the law goes backward.The website the article came from has been described as a "" fake news "" outlet by multiple sources including fact-checking site Snopes and The Times. It includes bizarre, false articles claiming pop singer Katy Perry has endorsed cannibalism.Collins responded to those on Twitter who asked why she was tweeting out fake news by tweeting to reputable news sources covering the same topic, but in a deeply different way.She told Stuff she didn't necessarily ""agree"" with every article she tweeted but wanted to draw attention to the issue.""I'm just concerned about the story about France itself,"" Collins said.She said France had a chance to strengthen its laws and had not and she hoped Ardern would bring this up with French President Emmanuel Macron ""It doesn't go far enough, that's my issue,"" Collins said.""I was shocked to learn there is no age of consent in France....This is a civilised country, they should know better.""""I often retweet articles of interest. I don't have to agree with everything in those articles, otherwise I would never tweet anything except my own stuff.""""I don't censor people. I don't say you shouldn't listen to people you don't disagree with. I say don't shoot the messenger - and the message to me is not about allegations of liberal conspiracy, it's that child sex abuse is wrong, it's disgraceful, and in some countries it is easier than others.""Collins said she didn't buy into ""conspiracies"" about liberals pushing paedophilia worldwide, despite sharing the article which suggested liberals were doing just that in its first paragraph.The baseless conspiracy theory that LGBT activists are also pushing for wider acceptable of paedophilia by adding ""P"" to LGBT"" has gained much traction in the United States in recent months.Collins did say anyone who had been police minister - as she has - would know there was an international network of paedophiles sharing abusive images of children.Asked whether she thought these people had exercised any influence on the French law passing, Collins said: ""I hope not.""Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern declined to comment at length on the French situation when asked, saying she would have to know more about the legal situation in the country before commenting.She also declined to comment on whether or not it was appropriate for an MP to tweet a link to an article from a website known to publish fake news.National leader Simon Bridges said he wouldn't discipline Collins over the tweet.""I think in this case Judith Collins feels strongly about the issue - that's legitimate. But it is a wrong source, she acknowledges that, and we should in general try and get them right.""Stuff",2018/08/07,snopes,0

But he did a death roll and knocked me off.""The gator then dragged the teen under the water, but Kaleb managed to break free and start swimming away. It wasn't long before the gator caught up to him, again.""He started pulling me down,"" Kaleb said. ""So I put my feet and I put it on his mouth, and I tried to jerk my arm off ... and I started swimming back but I felt like a little tug.""The gator pulled him under water once more, but this time Kaleb broke free for good, although without the lower half of his right arm.Kaleb said that after he was out of the water, he told his friends to call 911, and he tried to use anything to stop the bleeding while making his way back to his car.""I started grabbing some spider webs, and grabbing whatever I could. I put spider webs on my arm, because it would stop the bleeding,"" he said. ""When I got up the bank, it was still bleeding, so I took my arm and put it between my legs, and squeezed to stop the bleeding. I had the bleeding stopped before the cops even got there.""Kaleb's aunt, LaDawn Hayes, said her nephew had to make a difficult decision.""The gator took the arm,"" she said. ""He felt the bones break, felt everything kind of go and made a choice at that point that it was either his arm or his life.""Kaleb's friend Matt Baker said, ""He came up out of the water like Superman or something, waving to us saying, 'Hey, my arm's gone, call an ambulance.'""Kaleb swam back to the river bank and pinched his arm between his legs and waited for the paramedics to arrive.The teen's mother, Felinda Langdale, rushed to the scene. ""The cops came up to me and said, He's fine,'"" she said. ""He's really fine.""While Kaleb was being treated at the hospital, authorities caught and killed the alligator to retrieve the teen's arm. By the time the arm arrived at the hospital, however, too much time had passed to reattach it. Surgery to close his wounds was successful, but the family does not yet know when Kaleb will leave the hospital.""I'm glad it went after me, chose me instead of one of my friends because I don't think they would have done the same thing and got out of it,"" Kaleb said.""I'm just happy that I'm still alive... I could care less about the arm,"" he added.Kaleb has been in such good spirits that he wanted his aunt to snap a photo of him with his bandage so he could post it on Facebook.""You're on your pain meds, I'm not going to do that,"" Hayes told him. But he insisted, telling her, ""Let everyone know I'm OK and I can still drive my airboat. Let them know it was my right arm and not my left.""Kaleb has a message for those who visit him in the hospital: ""If you come here to visit me, you cry? You're leaving.""The family of Kaleb Langdale has started an account to accept donations on his behalf. Click here to donate.0 Shares",2012/07/10,snopes,0

Marijuana can be smoked, eaten, vaporized, brewed and even taken topically, but most people smoke it.The intoxicating chemical in marijuana is tetrahydracannabinol, or THC. According to research from the Potency Monitoring Project , the average THC content of marijuana has soared from less than 1 percent in 1972, to 3 to 4 percent in the 1990s, to nearly 13 percent in 2010. Today, some retail marijuana has 30 percent THC or more. The increased potency makes it difficult to determine the short- and long-term effects of marijuanaHow Cannabis is consumedIn a 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 17.4 million people in the United States said they had used marijuana in the past month. Since then, many states have made it legal to use marijuana recreationally or medically. As of early 2017, 26 states and the District of Columbia have made the use of pot legal in one form or another. A 2016 Gallup poll found that one in eight people smoke marijuana and 43 percent of U.S. adults admit to trying it.Marijuana is usually smoked, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). The Cannabis (called ""pot,"" ""weed,"" ""grass,"" etc.) is typically spread on rolling papers and formed into a cigarette, often referred to as a joint, or a cigar-like blunt. Smoking releases the THC, which is absorbed into the blood stream through the lungs. Glass pipes, bubblers and bongs are other ways to smoke marijuana.Marijuana can also be ingested in food, often a choice of those who are using medical marijuana. Aside from the popular ""pot brownie,"" edible marijuana can be added to a number of foods, including candy, ice cream and butter. Some states that have legalized marijuana have issued rules for packaging and labeling ""marijuana edibles.""Cannabis can be taken in liquid form, by brewing it as a tea. It can also be added to other beverages, including soda, milk and alcohol. Hashish is a resin made of the concentrated plant material. Other forms include capsules, oral sprays and topical oils. A relatively new method of inhaling marijuana is vaporization , a ""smokeless"" delivery system using devices such as e-cigarettes. By heating the Cannabis at lower temperatures, the plant's oils or extracts are released. Several studies suggest that ""vaping"" is better for health than smoking pot. Vaporized marijuana contains little other than cannabinoids, according to a 2004 study in the Journal of Cannabis Therapeutics . Users inhaled fewer toxic compounds and carbon monoxide when vaping compared with smoking marijuana, according to a 2007 study in the journal Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics . According to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, there hasn't been enough research to conclude how much healthier vaping is than smoking unfiltered marijuana.How marijuana affects the mindMarijuana reaches the same pleasure centers in the brain that are targeted by heroin, cocaine and alcohol.Depending on the quantity, quality and method of consumption, marijuana can produce a feeling of euphoria — or high — by stimulating brain cells to release the chemical dopamine. When smoked or otherwise inhaled, the feeling of euphoria is almost immediate. When ingested in food, it takes much longer, even hours, for the drug to signal the brain to release the dopamine, according to the National Institutes of Health .Other changes in mood can occur, with relaxation frequently being reported. Some users experience heightened sensory perception, with colors appearing more vivid and noises being louder. For some, marijuana can cause an altered perception of time and increased appetite, known as the ""munchies.""The impact can vary by person, how often they have used the drug, the strength of the drug and how often it has been since they have gotten high, among other factors.""In some cases, reported side effects of THC include elation, anxiety, tachycardia, short-term memory recall issues, sedation, relaxation, pain-relief and many more,"" said A.J. Fabrizio, a marijuana chemistry expert at Terra Tech Corp, a California agricultural company focused on local farming and medical cannabis.Other effects, according to the NIH, include:Feelings of panic and fear (paranoia)HallucinationsDecreased ability to perform tasks that require coordinationDecreased interest in completing tasksWhen coming down from the high, users may feel depressed or extremely tired. While marijuana use produces a mellow experience (users are sometimes referred to as ""stoners"") for some, it can heighten agitation, anxiety, insomnia and irritability, according to the NIH.Marijuana and teensWhen marijuana use begins in the teen years, it can have a significant impact on brain development, including decreased brain activity, fewer neural fibers in certain areas and a smaller than average hippocampus, which controls learning and memory functions.According to a 2014 Northwestern Medicine study of teen marijuana users, memory-related structures in the brain appeared to shrink, a possible signs of a decrease in neurons. These abnormalities remained two years after the teen stopped using marijuana, indicating that the drug has long-term effects and look similar to brains of schizophrenics. Those who started using marijuana after 21 generally do not experience the same type of brain abnormalities as those who started using the drug earlier.Long-term users report that they sometimes have trouble thinking clearly, organizing their thoughts, multitasking and remembering things. Sustained marijuana use can also slow reaction times in some individuals.Another study by the University of Montreal published in the journal Development and Psychopathology in 2016 found similar results after researching almost 300 students. Those that started smoking around age 14 did worse on some cognitive tests than non-smokers. The study found that pot smokers also have a higher school dropout rate. Those that waited to start around age 17 did not seem to have the same impairments. How marijuana affects the bodyMarijuana smoke can cause many of the same respiratory problems experienced by tobacco smokers, such as increased daily cough and phlegm production, more frequent acute chest illnesses such as bronchitis, and a greater instance of lung infections, according to NIDA .While it had been thought that there was a connection between marijuana smoking and increased risk of lung cancer, even those who are heavy marijuana users do not appear to be at greater risk for lung cancer , according to a 2013 study by Dr. Donald Tashkin, UCLA professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine.A 2017 study by the Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia found that those who used marijuana were 26 percent more likely to have a stroke than those who did not use marijuana. Those studied were also 10 percent more likely to have developed heart failure.Marijuana can also raise heart rate by 20 percent to 100 percent shortly after smoking and the effect can last up to three hours, according to NIDA. Marijuana also can reduce sperm production in men and disrupts a woman's menstrual cycle, according to NIDA.While it is widely thought that marijuana is not addictive, about 30 percent users may have some degree of marijuana use disorder, according to NIDA . Long-term marijuana users who try to quit experience cravings, irritability, sleeplessness, decreased appetite and anxiety — some of the same physical symptoms of those trying to quit other types of drugs or alcohol. A 2016 study found a link between certain genetic markers and symptoms of marijuana addiction , suggesting that some people may have a genetic predisposition to marijuana addiction. That same study showed some overlap between the genetic risk factors for marijuana dependence and the genetic risk factors for depression, suggesting a possible reason why these two conditions often occur together, the researchers said.You might not think marijuana and quizzes go together, but on the assumption that you arrived at this quiz sober, we pose some serious questions that will require your utmost attention and critical thinking skills.

TMZ recently approached Senator Marco Rubio at Reagan National Airport for comment about the Jesse Wellens-directed clip, which shows the West Coast rapper aiming a prop gun at a clown parody of president Donald Trump. ""Snoop shouldn't have done that. We've had presidents assassinated in this country before so anything like that is really something we should be careful about,"" Rubio said. ""I think people could disagree on policy, but we gotta be careful with that kind of thing, because the wrong person sees that and gets the wrong idea, you can have a real problem. I'm not sure what Snoop was thinking. He should think about that a little."" In a recent interview with Billboard, Snoop Dogg said he wasn't looking for controversy. ""When I be putting shit out, I don’t ever expect or look for a reaction. I just put it out because I feel like it’s something that’s missing.

Salil Sheety, who has been the groups Secretary General since 2010, accused Trump of hateful politics and being a threat to human rights across the globe.President Trump takes actions that violate human rights at home and abroad, the group reports. He put Trump in the same group as the barbaric leaders of Egypt, the Philippines, Venezuela, Russia and China who Sheety said, are callously undermining the rights of millions.Donald Trumps politics may have marked a new era of human rights regression but they are not unique, said Shetty. The specters of hatred and fear now loom large in world affairs, he continued, and we have few governments standing up for human rights in these disturbing times.Add your name to millions demanding Congress take action on the Presidents crimes. IMPEACH TRUMP & PENCE!Along with Trumps treatment of womens rights, LGBTQ rights and his politics that were discriminatory or otherwise contradicted international human rights principles, Shetty singled out Trumps travel bans aimed at Muslim-majority countries as a transparently hateful move.Shetty added that the bans, some which have survived court challenges, set the scene for a year in which leaders took the politics of hate to its most dangerous conclusion.The report also cites Trumps views on immigration and immigrants as examples of these hateful new policies. Those include his plan to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, increased detention of asylum seekers and their families, increased immigration and customs enforcement, penalties against sanctuary cities and prioritized deportation of migrants.The report also sheds light on human rights abuses such as the termination of the Central American Minors program last August, which had allowed those under 21 to flee violence in Central America if their parents already had achieved legal status in the U.S.It notes that more than 17,000 unaccompanied children and 26,000 people who were caught illegally enting the U.S. at the Mexican border between January and August were detained for months, many without proper access to medical care and legal counsel.The report notes that since September the Trump administration has worked to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, placing 800,000 individuals brought to the U.S. as children at risk of being deported.Trump then worked to stop the passage of the Dream Act to allow those who had DACA status to meet requirements to maintain their eligibility and get full legal status.The report also cites Trumps efforts against womens rights which it reports were broad and multi-faceted.President Trumps administration, continues the report, overturned politics that required universities to investigate sexual violence as gender discrimination and suspended equal pay initiatives that had helped women identify whether they were being paid less than male colleagues.Attacks on womens reproductive rights were particularly virulent, states the report. That includes attacks on funding for Planned Parenthood, a government issued rules exempting employers from promotion health insurance coverage for contraception, and the introduction of the global gag rule which prohibits financial assistance to any hospital or organization that provides information about safe, legal abortions.The rights of gay people were also reduced, marginalized or eliminated in many cases under Trump. The report, in particular, cites the marginalization of transgender people, including the elimination of guidelines that protected them in school, gave them access to public facilities and Trumps effort to ban them from the military.The group also raises a red flag about Trumps treatment of both domestic and foreign nationals accused of terrorism crimes, charging that the president flouted the presumption of innocence in a series of posts on Twitter in which he called for the death penalty.Trump also ended impunity for the systematic human rights violations of detainees at the prison in Guantanamo and elsewhere, and opened the door to a renewal of torture methods that had been banned under President Obama and the renewal of secret detention programs by the CIA.The report also points out that programs to stop mistreatment of minorities in the U.S. were rolled back, as the number of killings by law enforcement rose. African Americans who comprised 13 percent of the population represented nearly 23 percent of victims in 2017, states the report.The mistreatment of the mentally ill, the use of non-lethal weapons by police that turns out to actually be very lethal and the rise in gun violence and mass murders are all detailed in the new report, while funding for government studies of how to deal with gun violence was lowed or killed off.The use of the death penalty also rose in the U.S. under Trump, with more states executing prisoners than had happened in years.During the year, notes the report, four inmates were exonerated of the crimes for which they were originally sentenced to death in the states of Delaware, Florida, Arkansas, and Louisiana, bringing to 160 the number of such cases since 1973,The report criticizes what it termed the feeble response by world leaders like Trump to human rights issues, and what it called the willingness to tout fake news in order to manipulate public opinion.This was also the year that Trump changed Americas foreign policy to eliminate human rights as a factor in relationships with other countries.In fact, we saw Trump embrace, meet with and praise many dictators and authoritarians who abused the democratic system to stay in power while damaging relationships with longtime allies who are true democracies and do work to provide human rights to all.Through changes in trade politics, refusal to keep commitments to address the global climate crisis and in other ways, Trump embraced big business at the expense of individual citizens.This 400-page report from Amnesty International details much of this horror story, which unfortunately continues to grow worse by the day, week, month and year under Trump.Add your name to millions demanding Congress take action on the Presidents crimes.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-supporters-beat-gay-man-in-california/,gay canadian filmmaker chris ball was severely beaten and bloodied by emboldened donald trump supporters shortly after the 2016 election.,Unproven,"['chris ball', ' election related violence', ' us uncut']",http://www.washingtontimes.com/,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/nov/2/donald-trump-holds-high-flag-gay-equality/,2016/11/10,"By Richard Grenell - - Wednesday, November 2, 2016ANALYSIS/OPINION:Republican Presidential nominee Donald J. Trump made history Sunday and the political media barely noticed. Or maybe they did see it - but since it didn’t fit the narrative of what a Republican is supposed to look like they decided to ignore it.On Sunday, at a rally in Colorado, Mr. Trump proudly held up a rainbow flag with the words “LGBT for Trump ” written on it to a cheering crowd of thousands. It was an historic moment for gay equality and the Party of Lincoln as the 2016 GOP nominee for President of the United States held high the flag for gay equality. No other Republican Presidential nominee in history has embraced the LGBT community in such a loud and proud way.And yet, the moment was barely reported by the media despite the fact it happened in front of the traveling press corps accompanying Mr. Trump . Political reporters, not unsurprising, largely failed to write on the moment where a Republican challenged their negative media stereotype.But the moment was nevertheless historic. Trump walked on stage in Greeley, Colorado to a large cheering crowd when he spotted a rainbow flag in the audience. As the music blasted through the speakers, Mr. Trump pointed to a supporter as if to ask if he could see his flag and then motioned for a campaign worker to help retrieve the LGBT symbol of equality from the attendee.Within seconds, Mr. Trump was walking around the platform with the rainbow flag in his hands and moments later unfurled it in full display. You could see a huge smile on Mr. Trump ’s face as he walked to both sides of the stage to proudly hold up the rainbow flag announcing support from the gay and lesbian community.Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller told me, “ Mr. Trump is campaigning to be President for ALL Americans and was proud to carry the ‘LGBT for Trump ‘ rainbow flag on stage in Greeley, CO yesterday. He will protect all Americans from the radical Islamic extremists who perpetuate hate and violence around the world, unlike Hillary Clinton who dangerously plans for open borders and has accepted millions of dollars from repressive regimes with a history of violence, discrimination and oppression against women, gays and minorities.”The moment wasn’t the first time Mr. Trump made history for his support for LGBT equality, either. In Cleveland, Ohio, in July, he spoke to the Republican National Committee (RNC) and voiced his support for LGBT equality, even interrupting his nomination speech to thank the thousands of delegates and attendees for cheering and clapping when he announced his support. It was the first time a GOP nominee embraced the gay and lesbian voter and appealed for their support in their nomination speech. Mr. Trump also invited PayPal co-Founder Peter Thiel to speak at the RNC Convention in Cleveland where Mr. Thiel announced that he was gay and proud, making him the first Republican National Convention speaker in history to openly embrace his sexuality in a prepared speech.Sadly, Mr. Trump ’s embrace of the rainbow flag Sunday was largely ignored by the DC media types who four years earlier wrote widely and extensively about Mitt Romney’s inability to talk openly about LGBT equality in his 2012 bid for President. Mr. Romney failed to confront the loud religious right activists who condemned him for hiring gay campaign staffers prompting the political media to have a field day turning the moment into what they called a failure to lead all Americans. The news coverage in 2012 about Mr. Romney’s inability to appeal to gay and lesbian voters was a constant theme of the political media whenever the issue of gay marriage came up.Today, however, Mr. Trump ’s easy and consistent embrace of the LGBT community is rarely highlighted by the same media crowd. In fact, some liberal reporters have even tried to falsely claim that Trump is a traditional Republican nominee on the issue of gay equality.While it has been mostly unreported, Mr. Trump has embraced the LGBT community like no other GOP nominee in history. His rainbow flag waiving in Colorado was only the latest sign of his continued support for gay equality. Whatever happens on November 8, 2016 in the presidential race, Mr. Trump has forever changed the Republican party ’s support for LGBT equality and future Republican leaders will have a difficult time not meeting the new standard.Richard Grenell served as the U.S. spokesman for four U.S. Ambassadors to the United Nations. He is the longest-serving American to hold that position, having served from 2001-2008.Copyright © 2018 The Washington Times, LLC.

Response:Elementary and Secondary Education Enrollment In fall 2018, about 56.6 million students will attend elementary and secondary schools, including 50.7 million students in public schools and 5.9 million in private schools. Of the public school students, 35.6 million will be in prekindergarten through grade 8 and 15.1 million will be in grades 9 through 12. The fall 2018 public school enrollment is expected to be slightly higher than the 50.6 million enrolled in fall 2017 and is higher than the 49.5 million students enrolled in fall 2010 (source). Total public elementary and secondary enrollment is projected to increase between fall 2018 and fall 2027 to 52.1 million. Of the projected 50.7 million public school students entering prekindergarten through grade 12 in fall 2018, White students will account for 24.1 million. The remaining 26.6 million will be composed of 7.8 million Black students, 14.0 million Hispanic students, 2.6 million Asian students, 0.2 million Pacific Islander students, 0.5 million American Indian/Alaska Native students, and 1.6 million students of Two or more races. The percentage of students enrolled in public schools who are White is projected to continue to decline through at least fall 2027 along with the percentage of students who are Black, while the percentage of students who are Hispanic Asian, and of Two or more races are projected to increase (source). In fall 2018, about 1.4 million children are expected to attend public prekindergarten and 3.6 million are expected to attend public kindergarten (source). About 4.0 million public school students are expected to enroll in 9th grade in fall 2018 (source). Students typically enter American high schools in 9th grade. Teachers Public school systems will employ about 3.2 million full-time-equivalent (FTE) teachers in fall 2018, such that the number of pupils per FTE teacherthat is, the pupil/teacher ratiowill be 16.0. This ratio has remained consistent at around 16.0 since 2010. A projected 0.5 million FTE teachers will be working in private schools this fall, resulting in an estimated pupil/teacher ratio of 12.3, which is similar to the 2017 ratio of 12.2, but lower than the 2010 ratio of 13.0 (source). Expenditures Current expenditures for public elementary and secondary schools are projected to be $654 billion for the 2018–19 school year. The current expenditure per student is projected to be $12,910 for the 2018–19 school year (source). Attainment About 3.6 million students are expected to graduate from high school in 2018–19, including 3.3 million students from public high schools and 0.4 million students from private high schools (source). College and University Education Enrollment The number of students projected to attend American colleges and universities in fall 2018 is 19.9 million, which is higher than the enrollment of 15.3 million students in fall 2000, but lower than the enrollment peak of 21.0 million in fall 2010 (source). Total enrollment is expected to increase between fall 2018 and fall 2027 to 20.5 million. Females are expected to account for the majority of college and university students in fall 2018: about 11.2 million females will attend in fall 2018, compared with 8.7 million males. Also, more students are expected to attend full time (an estimated 12.1 million students) than part time (7.8 million students) (source). Some 6.7 million students will attend 2-year institutions and 13.3 million will attend 4-year institutions in fall 2018 (source). About 17.0 million students are expected to enroll in undergraduate programs, and 2.9 million are expected to enroll in postbaccalaureate programs (source). In 2018, a projected 12.3 million college and university students will be under age 25 and 7.6 million students will be 25 years old and over. The number of college and university students under age 25 hit a peak of 12.2 million in 2011 and has remained steady since that time. The number of students 25 years old and over hit a similar peak in 2010 (of 8.9 million) but the overall enrollment for this age group declined from 2010 to 2018 (source). Attainment During the 2018–19 school year, colleges and universities are expected to award 1.0 million associate‘s degrees; 1.9 million bachelor's degrees; 780,000 master's degrees; and 182,000 doctor's degrees (source). In 2015–16, postsecondary institutions awarded 939,000 certificates below the associate‘s degree level, 1.0 million associate‘s degrees, 1.9 million bachelor‘s degrees, 786,000 master‘s degrees, and 178,000 doctor‘s degrees (source). Background information from prior school years: Some information on the 2018–19 school year is not available. This section presents selected highlights from prior school years to provide some context for the current school year. Elementary and Secondary Schools and Districts In 2015–16, there were about 13,600 public school districts (source) with close to 98,300 public schools, including about 6,900 charter schools (source). In fall 2015, there were about 34,600 private schools offering kindergarten or higher grades (source). In 2016–17, about one-third (32 percent) of districts reported that all of their Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs were structured as career pathways that align with related postsecondary programs, and an additional one-third (33 percent) reported that most of their programs were structured this way (source). High School Dropout The percentage of high school dropouts among 16- to 24-year-olds declined from 10.9 percent in 2000 to 6.1 percent in 2016 (source). Reflecting the overall decline in the dropout rate between 2000 and 2016, the rates also declined for White, Black, and Hispanic students. Immediate College Enrollment The percentage of students enrolling in college in the fall immediately following high school completion was 69.8 percent in 2016 (source). Postsecondary Demographics Higher numbers and percentages of Black and Hispanic students are attending colleges and universities. The percentage of all students attending colleges and universities who were Black was higher in 2016 than in 2000 (13.7 vs. 11.7 percent), and the percentage who were Hispanic rose from 9.9 to 18.2 percent over the same time period (source). Also, the percentage of Hispanic 18- to 24-year-olds enrolled in colleges and universities increased from 21.7 percent in 2000 to 39.2 percent in 2016, and the percentage of Black 18- to 24-year-olds enrolled increased from 30.5 percent to 36.2 percent in that same period (source). Postsecondary Finance For the 2016–17 academic year, the average annual price for undergraduate tuition, fees, room, and board was $17,237 at public institutions, $44,551 at private nonprofit institutions, and $25,431 at private for-profit institutions. Charges for tuition and required fees averaged $6,817 at public institutions, $32,556 at private nonprofit institutions, and $14,419 at private for-profit institutions (source). Labor Force Outcomes In 2016, about 78.8 percent of 25- to 34-year-olds with a bachelor's or higher degree in the labor force had year-round, full-time jobs, compared with 72.3 percent of those with an associate's degree, 69.5 percent of those with some college education, 68.9 percent of those who completed high school, and 60.1 percent of those without a high school diploma or its equivalent (source). In 2017, the unemployment rate for 25- to 34-year-olds with a bachelor‘s or higher degree (2.5 percent) was lower than the rate for young adults with some college (4.4 percent), those who had completed high school (7.2 percent), and those who had not completed high school (13.2 percent) (source). In 2016, for young adults ages 25–34 who worked full time, year round, higher educational attainment was associated with higher median earnings; this pattern was consistent from 2000 through 2016. For example, in 2016, the median earnings of young adults with a bachelor's degree ($50,000) were 57 percent higher than those of young adult high school completers ($31,800). The median earnings of young adult high school completers were 26 percent higher than those of young adults who did not complete high school ($25,400). In addition, in 2016, the median earnings of young adults with a master's or higher degree were $64,100, some 28 percent higher than those of young adults with a bachelor's degree ($50,000) (source).

Question: What are the new back to school statistics for 2018? Of the projected 50.7 million public school students entering prekindergarten through grade 12 in fall 2018, White students will account for 24.1 million. The remaining 26.6 million will be composed of 7.8 million Black students, 14.0 million Hispanic students, 2.6 million Asian students, 0.2 million Pacific Islander students, 0.5 million American Indian/Alaska Native students, and 1.6 million students of Two or more races. The percentage of students enrolled in public schools who are White is projected to continue to decline through at least fall 2027 along with the percentage of students who are Black, while the percentage of students who are Hispanic Asian, and of Two or more races are projected to increase (source). In fall 2018, about 1.4 million children are expected to attend public prekindergarten and 3.6 million are expected to attend public kindergarten (source). About 4.0 million public school students are expected to enroll in 9th grade in fall 2018 (source). Students typically enter American high schools in 9th grade. Public school systems will employ about 3.2 million full-time-equivalent (FTE) teachers in fall 2018, such that the number of pupils per FTE teacherthat is, the pupil/teacher ratiowill be 16.0. This ratio has remained consistent at around 16.0 since 2010. A projected 0.5 million FTE teachers will be working in private schools this fall, resulting in an estimated pupil/teacher ratio of 12.3, which is similar to the 2017 ratio of 12.2, but lower than the 2010 ratio of 13.0 (source). Current expenditures for public elementary and secondary schools are projected to be $654 billion for the 2018–19 school year. The current expenditure per student is projected to be $12,910 for the 2018–19 school year (source).

The number of students projected to attend American colleges and universities in fall 2018 is 19.9 million, which is higher than the enrollment of 15.3 million students in fall 2000, but lower than the enrollment peak of 21.0 million in fall 2010 (source). Total enrollment is expected to increase between fall 2018 and fall 2027 to 20.5 million. Females are expected to account for the majority of college and university students in fall 2018: about 11.2 million females will attend in fall 2018, compared with 8.7 million males.

In 2018, a projected 12.3 million college and university students will be under age 25 and 7.6 million students will be 25 years old and over. The number of college and university students under age 25 hit a peak of 12.2 million in 2011 and has remained steady since that time. The number of students 25 years old and over hit a similar peak in 2010 (of 8.9 million) but the overall enrollment for this age group declined from 2010 to 2018 (source). During the 2018–19 school year, colleges and universities are expected to award 1.0 million associate‘s degrees; 1.9 million bachelor's degrees; 780,000 master's degrees; and 182,000 doctor's degrees (source).

By Brian Alexandermsnbc.com contributormsnbc.com contributor updated 6/30/2010 8:13:14 AM ET2010-06-30T12:13:14Print Font:+- In college, I lived next door to an agonizingly pretty cocktail waitress. Late at night, after shed come home from work, her boyfriend he drove a Porsche, naturally would arrive for his nightly booty call. The walls were thin. Soon, like clockwork, her voice would pierce the drywall like a steam locomotives whistle: hehehehehe followed by yesyesyes! and then an explosion of high-pitched ohmigodohmigodohmigod! While I was envious at the time, now it seems that all her ecstatic vocals might have been just the female equivalent of Your butt looks great in those jeans, Babe. Honest. A study released last month in the Archives of Sexual Behavior shows that those seemingly uncontrollable ohmigods during apparent orgasm are often play-acting meant to manipulate men. The scientists, Gayle Brewer of the University of Central Lancashire and Colin Hendrie of the University of Leeds, asked 71 women between the ages of 18 and 48 a series of questions. They broke down the vocalizations into categories that included silence, moan/groan, scream/shriek/squeal, words (such as Yes! or the partners name, and instructional commands like more. Other questions asked why the women made the vocalizations and at what point they themselves had an orgasm, if they had an orgasm at all, and, if not, why they were doing all that shouting. Well, it turned out that women were making conscious vocalizations in order to influence their partner rather than as a direct expression of sexual arousal, Brewer told me.Women seek to speed things up In the paper revealing these results, Brewer and Hendrie use the phrase manipulate male behavior to [the womens] advantage which sounds like the women were trying to wrangle a pair of diamond earrings out of the guy. But thats not really what they meant. For example, women reported using these vocalizations to speed up their partners ejaculation due to boredom, fatigue, discomfort, time limitations, Brewer said. In other words, the sounds the women emitted were not because they were out-of-control excited. Indeed, when they were most excited, say during oral sex when they were more likely to have an orgasm, they didnt do much of the old scream-n-shout. AdvertiseAdvertiseAdvertiseRather, it was a tactic they used to induce their man to do something, like get it over with. In most cases, they were also trying to be nice. Importantly, 92 percent of participants felt very strongly that these vocalizations boosted their partners self-esteem, the paper stated, and 87 percent reported using them for this purpose, like the hilarious scene from the 1975 movie The Stepford Wives: Youre the king, Frank! Vote: Does loud mean faking it?Of course, as Meg Ryan proved in another movie, When Harry Met Sally, women can use their voices to fake an orgasm, too. In Brewers survey, more than 25 percent of women routinely used vocalization to fake it. They did it about 90 percent of the time they realized they would not climax. About 80 percent faked using vocalizations about half the time they were unable to have an orgasm. Women do this because their men are so goal-directed they wont stop until a woman climaxes, the authors say.

Rates of women who are opting for preventive mastectomies, such as Angeline Jolie, have increased by an estimated 50 percent in recent years, experts say. But many doctors are puzzled because the operation doesn't carry a 100 percent guarantee, it's major surgery -- and women have other options, from a once-a-day pill to careful monitoring. Larry Page's damaged vocal cords: Treatment comes with trade-offs Report questioning salt guidelines riles heart experts CDC: 2012 was deadliest year for West Nile in US What stresses moms most? Themselves, survey says That does not surprise Charlene Muehlenhard, professor of clinical psychology at the University of Kansas in Lawrence. In a 2009 study she co-authored in the Journal of Sex Research, called Mens and Womens Reports of Pretending Orgasm, she explored the idea that men and women tend to follow scripted roles. Men are supposed to give a woman an orgasm and her orgasm proves the quality of his work, she said. Because women do not ejaculate, men have to rely on some other outward sign, like a woman singing Oh Sweet Mystery of Life! (Young Frankenstein) to know weve done our job. So women vocalize as a way of saying attaboy even if they werent all that excited. As one woman told Muehlenhard, I pretended to have an orgasm so that my partner would [finish]. He couldnt [finish] until I orgasmed.Even men fake it, though not as much (Men fake, too, though we do it much less frequently. In Muehlenhards study, 36 percent of men who did fake it at least once used vocal acting whereas 61 percent of women who faked it at least once used vocal acting.) This behavior could have deep evolutionary roots. We are biological creatures, Muehlenhard said. The biological origins of making noise during sex, though it is hard to study, can be explored by looking at animals. For example, a 2008 study published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society found that female macaques influence the likelihood of ejaculation by calling versus remaining silent and by adjusting the timing of call onset. Male macaques thrust at a higher rate when females vocalized in certain ways. It was not the thrusting that induced the calling, it was the calling that induced the thrusting. The females controlled the males with their voices. When the females did not issue the right kind of vocal calls, males tended not to ejaculate. The human take-away message? If you want a man to have his own climax, say the right things. Of course, as Muehlenhard explained, our culture lays on top of our biology. There is a lot of evidence that biology and socialization and culture work together to influence our behaviors, especially the way we have sex. AdvertiseAdvertiseAdvertiseSadly, culture and socialization do not necessarily teach us accurate lessons. Studies consistently show that men and women think they know just what the other gender desires, but that we are often wrong. So we end up trying to outguess each other. Thats why Muehlenhard thinks there could be a downside to the kind of manipulation Brewer found.There's a downside to all that noise It seems problematic to make arousal noises when one is actually bored or in pain, she said. That would be likely to convey misinformation to ones partner, who is likely to think that this sexual activity is pleasing and should be repeated next time. I think that in general, honesty is the best policy. Which is not to say that giving our lovers a little dash of confidence with some extra hehehehe and ohmigoohmigodohmigod (or, as one woman I know described her husbands recent outburst: Duuuude!) even if you arent really feeling it is always a bad thing. People think that its O.K. to do things to arouse their sexual partners and to make them feel good, Muehlenhard said. If making noise arouses ones partner, that might be O.K. But just so you know, your butt really does look great in those jeans.

It happened on Nov. 7, 2012, the day after Mitt Romney lost what had been presumed to be a winnable race against President Obama. Republicans were spiraling into an identity crisis, one that had some wondering whether a GOP president would ever sit in the Oval Office again. But on the 26th floor of a golden Manhattan tower that bears his name, Trump was coming to the conclusion that his own moment was at hand. And in typical fashion, the first thing he thought about was how to brand it. One after another, phrases popped into his head. “We Will Make America Great.” That one did not have the right ring. Then, “Make America Great.” But that sounded like a slight to the country. “I said, ‘That is so good.’ I wrote it down,” Trump recalled in an interview. “I went to my lawyers. I have a lot of lawyers in-house. We have many lawyers. I have got guys that handle this stuff. Five days later, Trump signed an application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in which he asked for exclusive rights to use “Make America Great Again” for “political action committee services, namely, promoting public awareness of political issues and fundraising in the field of politics.” He enclosed a $325 registration fee. His was a vision that ran against the conventional wisdom of the time — in fact, it was “much the opposite,” Trump said. To save itself, the Republican establishment was convinced, the GOP would have to sand off its edges, become kinder and more inclusive. “Make America Great Again” was divisive and backward-looking. It made no nod to diversity or civility or progress. It sounded like a death wish. But Trump had seen something different in the country, and in the daily lives of its struggling citizens. “I felt that jobs were hurting,” he said. “I looked at the many types of illness our country had, and whether it’s at the border, whether it’s security, whether it’s law and order or lack of law and order. Democrats slammed it. “If you’re looking for someone to say what is wrong with America, I’m not your candidate. I think there is more right than wrong,” Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton said. “I don’t think we have to make America great. Her husband, former president Bill Clinton, went so far as to declare it a racist dog whistle. “I’m actually old enough to remember the good old days, and they weren’t all that good in many ways,” he said at a rally in Orlando. The slogan itself was not entirely original. Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush had used “Let’s Make America Great Again” in their 1980 campaign — a fact that Trump maintained he did not know until about a year ago. “But he didn’t trademark it,” Trump said of Reagan. His decision to claim legal ownership reflected a businessman’s mind-set. “I think I’m somebody that understands marketing,” Trump said. Trump Organization lawyer Alan Garten said Trump holds upward of 800 trademarks in more than 80 countries. The trademark became effective on July 14, 2015, a month after Trump formally announced his campaign and met the legal requirement that he was actually using it for the purposes spelled out in his application. Having won the trademark, Trump was aggressive in protecting his idea. When his GOP primary rivals Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker began tucking “make America great again” into their own speeches, Trump’s lawyers fired off cease-and-desist letters. Trump was an impulsive and erratic candidate who ran a chaotic campaign. “I didn’t know it was going to catch on like it did. It’s been amazing,” Trump said. There were plenty of snickers when his Federal Election Commission filings showed that his campaign was spending more on “Make America Great Again” trucker caps than on polling, political consultants, staff or television ads. “An appropriate icon for his failing campaign,” the Washington Examiner’s Philip Wegmann wrote in late October. Trump saw the hats as a fundraising and advertising vehicle. He was thrilled when his campaign headgear landed in the New York Times Style section — during Fashion Week, no less. “In the Style section, it was the ornament — what do you call that? — an accessory. They said the accessory of the year. You know the hat. You’d see people going to the fanciest balls at the Waldorf Astoria wearing red hats,” he exulted. As is often the case, Trump’s description is more than a little hyperbolic. None of which fazed the celebrity billionaire who had debuted the hats by wearing one during a July 2015 trip to the Mexican border — or the legions of supporters who raced to snap them up. Trump had designed them himself, he said. The basic models sold through his campaign website were priced at $25. “How many did we sell? Does anyone know? Millions!” Trump said in the interview. “It was copied, unfortunately. It was knocked off by 10 to one. It was knocked off by others. However many hats he sold, what cannot be disputed is that “Make America Great Again” caught on. It was the most effective kind of political message, bite-sized and visceral. “It actually inspired me,” Trump said, “because to me, it meant jobs. It meant industry, and meant military strength. It meant taking care of our veterans. That kind of mission statement was something that Clinton’s campaign — for all its poll testing and high-priced advice from Madison Avenue — struggled to articulate. Her strategists considered 85 possibilities for a general-election campaign slogan before settling on “Stronger Together,” according to an email from the account of campaign chairman John Podesta that was published by WikiLeaks. What they were up against was nothing short of “a marketing genius,” said David Axelrod, who had been Obama’s chief political strategist. Trump “understood the market that he was trying to reach. You can’t deny him that. While Clinton carried the popular vote, Trump lined up the states he needed to win what mattered: the electoral college. Halfway through his interview with The Washington Post, Trump shared a bit of news: He already has decided on his slogan for a reelection bid in 2020. “Are you ready?” he said. “Get me my lawyer!” the president-elect shouted. Two minutes later, one arrived. “Will you trademark and register, if you would, if you like it — I think I like it, right? Do this: ‘Keep America Great,’ with an exclamation point. With and without an exclamation. ‘Keep America Great,’ ” Trump said. “Got it,” the lawyer replied. That bit of business out of the way, Trump returned to the interview. “I never thought I’d be giving [you] my expression for four years [from now],” he said. “But I am so confident that we are going to be, it is going to be so amazing. It’s the only reason I give it to you. All of which raises the questions: How can greatness be measured and sensed? What does it even mean? “Being a great president has to do with a lot of things, but one of them is being a great cheerleader for the country,” Trump said. “And we’re going to show the people as we build up our military, we’re going to display our military. “That military may come marching down Pennsylvania Avenue. That military may be flying over New York City and Washington, D.C., for parades. I mean, we’re going to be showing our military,” he added. The president-elect has an ambitious to-do list for the next four years: building stronger borders, keeping the country safe against terrorism, producing more jobs, repealing the Affordable Care Act, replacing it with something better, promoting excellence in engineering and science, investing in modern infrastructure. Ultimately, it will be up to the people for whom “Make America Great Again” was a covenant, not a slogan, to decide whether the 45th president has lived up to his promise. “I think they have to feel it,” Trump acknowledged. “Honestly, you haven’t seen anything yet. Wait till you see what happens, starting next Monday,” he said. “A lot of things are going to happen. He has been holding interviews and meetings as he prepares to enter the White House. Wait 1 second to continue. Alice Crites contributed to this report.",2017/01/17,snopes,1

The lawsuit challenges Deerfield’s recent attempt to criminalize so-called “assault weapons” and “high capacity magazines” within village limits. “Every law-abiding villager of Deerfield has the right to protect themselves, their homes, and their loved ones with the firearm that best suits their needs,” said Chris W.

(The Oregonian)Commentagreen@oregonian.comThe Oregonian/OregonLiveRoughly a third of the people arrested in the past week of anti-Trump demonstrations in Portland apparently didn't vote in the election they were protesting . Thirty-six of the 112 arrested people -- 32 percent -- were registered in Oregon but didn't return ballots, according to data compiled by the Multnomah County Elections Division. The data showed 31 people -- 28 percent -- did vote in Oregon.But the figures leave unanswered questions:The Elections Division determined that another 36 of the people weren't registered in Oregon at the time of the Nov. 8 election -- but that doesn't mean they weren't registered in another state, said spokesman Eric Sample.There's no specific time period when someone living in Oregon must register to vote here instead of their home state, he said. That's particularly common among out-of-state college students.So it's possible that some or all of those 36 people who weren't registered in Oregon could have voted in other states.What's more, Sample said, a state-by-state search would be necessary to determine whether those 36 people are registered elsewhere.The Election Division also wasn't able to account for the voter participation of five protesters because it lacked middle names for those people or birth dates.Of the 112 protesters who were arrested, four were under age 18 -- in other words, too young to vote.The Elections Division came up with the results after running the names and ages of the protesters through its Oregon database and looking for matches in response to a public records request by KGW-TV. The Elections Division also provided the results Tuesday to The Oregonian/OregonLive, but the numbers are different from those reported by KGW, in part because the division had updated information.The Oregonian/OregonLive is independently researching who among the arrested protesters voted in Oregon as well as Washington, by checking voter participation records.

They’re watching a sepia-toned video, in which children dance around a maypole, a spider crawls across a clown’s face and eerie, ambient chanting gives way to a backward, demonic voice-over. The group chuckles with approval. They’re here plotting to bring their wisdom to the nation’s public elementary school children. They point out that Christian evangelical groups already have infiltrated the lives of America’s children through after-school religious programming in public schools, and they appear determined to give young students a choice: Jesus or Satan. “It’s critical that children understand that there are multiple perspectives on all issues, and that they have a choice in how they think,” said Doug Mesner, the Satanic Temple’s co-founder. On Monday, the group plans to introduce its After School Satan Club to public elementary schools, including one in Prince George’s County, petitioning school officials to allow them to open immediately as the academic year starts. Chapter heads from New York, Boston, Utah and Arizona were in Salem on July 10 talking strategy, with others from Minneapolis, Detroit, San Jose, New Orleans, Pittsburgh and Florida participating online. The promotional video, which feels like a mash-up of a horror movie trailer and a “Saturday Night Live” sketch, will serve to promote the new club along with its website — Afterschoolsatan.com. The Satanic Temple — which has been offering tongue-in-cheek support for the fallen angel in public arenas that have embraced prayer and parochial ceremonies — is bringing its fight over constitutional separation of church and state to the nation’s schools. But the group’s plan for public schoolchildren isn’t actually about promoting worship of the devil. The Satanic Temple doesn’t espouse a belief in the existence of a supernatural being that other religions identify solemnly as Satan, or Lucifer, or Beelzebub. The Temple rejects all forms of supernaturalism and is committed to the view that scientific rationality provides the best measure of reality. According to Mesner, who goes by the professional name of Lucien Greaves, “Satan” is just a “metaphorical construct” intended to represent the rejection of all forms of tyranny over the human mind. The curriculum for the proposed after-school clubs emphasizes the development of reasoning and social skills. The group says meetings will include a healthful snack, literature lesson, creative learning activities, a science lesson, puzzle solving and an art project. Every child will receive a membership card and must have a signed parental­ permission slip to attend. “We think it’s important for kids to be able to see multiple points of view, to reason things through, to have empathy and feelings of benevolence for their fellow human beings,” said the Satanic Temple’s Utah chapter head, who goes by the name Chalice Blythe. The emphasis on multiple perspectives is a hint pointing to the Temple’s true foe. The group at first intends to roll out the clubs in a limited number of schools in districts that also host an evangelical Christian after-school program known as the Good News Club. Good News Clubs, which are sponsored by an organization founded in 1937 called the Child Evangelism Fellowship (CEF), aim to reach children as young as 5 with a fundamentalist form of evangelical Christianity. For most of their history, Good News Clubs were largely excluded from public schools out of concern that their presence would violate the Constitution. In 2001, in a case that commanded the resources of powerful legal advocacy groups on the religious right, including the Alliance Defending Freedom and the Liberty Counsel, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that to exclude an after-school program on account of the religious views of its sponsors amounted to a violation of free-speech rights. The CEF then went on a tear, and by 2011, it reported 3,560 Good News Clubs, putting them in more than 5 percent of the nation’s public elementary schools. The Satanic Temple makes no secret of its desire to use that same approach. “We would like to thank the Liberty Counsel specifically for opening the doors to the After School Satan Clubs through their dedication to religious liberty,” Greaves explained to the gathering of chapter heads in Salem. Should The Satanic Temple be allowed to open After School Satan Clubs in elementary schools? Yes they should be allowed. Pardon the interruption! We need to verify that you are an actual person. Yes they should be allowed. This is a non-scientific user poll. Results are not statistically valid and cannot be assumed to reflect the views of Washington Post users as a group or the general population. The Liberty Counsel agrees that the Satanic Temple has a right to organize its clubs in public schools and takes the view that they can’t be banned so long as they’re not disruptive or engaging in rituals that put people at risk. “I would definitely oppose after­-school Satanic clubs, but they have a First Amendment right to meet,” said Mat Staver, Liberty Counsel’s founder and chairman. “I suspect, in this particular case, I can’t imagine there’s going to be a lot of students participating in this. The Satanic Temple is eager to compete directly with the Good News Clubs and doesn’t hide its belief that its own after-school product is on the right side. “While the Good News Clubs focus on indoctrination, instilling children with a fear of hell and God’s wrath, After School Satan Clubs will focus on free inquiry and rationalism,” Greaves said. Good News Club leaders have defended their organization’s presence in public schools. According to the Good News Club’s website, “each club includes a clear presentation of the Gospel and an opportunity for children to trust the Lord Jesus as Savior. Amy Jensen, a professional educator in Tucson who has a master’s degree in curriculum, instruction and teaching from the University of Denver, says she has decided to lead an After School Satan Club after comparing its curriculum materials with those of the Good News Club. Jensen noted that the Satanic Temple’s materials say the group encourages benevolence and empathy among all people, and advocates practical common sense. “As a teacher, if I were deciding whether to teach that or the fear and hatred of other people’s beliefs, which is what Good News Clubs teach, I would choose what the Satanic Temple has available,” she said. Like all ASSC teachers, Jensen is a volunteer. To cover After School Satan Club costs, including facility use fees and curriculum materials, the Satanic Temple is launching a crowdfunding campaign — which is how it covers many of its initiatives. The blend of political activism, religious critique and performance art that characterizes the After School Satan Club proposal is not a new approach for the Satanic Temple. It is just the most recent in a series of efforts that have made the Temple famous and notorious. In 2014, after the Supreme Court ruled that the regular recitation of prayers before town meetings did not violate the First Amendment, provided that towns do not discriminate among religions, the Temple decided to test just how much religious liberty towns allowed. They volunteered to perform a Satanic benediction in an Arizona town where the board had regularly opened with a Christian prayer. In that case, the town preferred to abolish the practice of opening prayers. In this and other instances — such as when the Satanic Temple proposed the installation of a statue of Baphomet in Oklahoma in response to a stone monument emblazoned with the Ten Commandments — the thrust of the Temple’s activism has been to prevent religious groups from claiming the mantle of implicit state endorsement. The group’s activism has much in common with a movement started a decade ago, when Bobby Henderson of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster penned an open letter to the Kansas School Board in 2005, citing fears that the introduction of teaching religious intelligent design alongside the theory of evolution would inculcate public school students with Christian thought. Henderson argued that believing that there is a benevolent deity made of spaghetti and meatballs is just as legitimate as believing in God. Like the Satanic Temple, the Pastafarians insist that theirs is a genuine religion. “The Church of FSM is legit, and backed by hard science. Anything that comes across as humor or satire is purely coincidental,” Henderson says on his website. “Let me make this clear: we are not anti-religion, we are anti-crazy nonsense done in the name of religion. Greaves likewise insists that the Satanic Temple is much more than satire: “We’ve moved well beyond being a simple political ploy and into being a very sincere movement that seeks to separate religion from superstition,” he said. The Satanic Temple expects to face opposition to its after-school proposal. When the group sought to erect the Baphomet monument, the Oklahoma governor’s office dismissed the proposal as “absurd,” and right-wing activists joined the attack. Given the fight ahead and the long odds of pushing Christianity out of public schools, an important question about the After School Satan Clubs is: Does the Satanic Temple really want religion — even its own — in public schools? Greaves is blunt: “We are only doing this because Good News Clubs have created a need for this. If Good News Clubs would operate in churches rather than public schools, that need would disappear. In the 2001 Supreme Court ruling, Justice David Souter penned a scathing dissent. The Satanic Temple probably wasn’t front and center in his thinking. Yet it appears determined to prove him correct. Stewart is a Boston-based journalist. She is the author of “The Good News Club,” an investigative book about public education and religious fundamentalism in America.",2016/07/30,snopes,1

As he emptied his nets north of Danish isle Saltholm in the strait Oresund which seperates Denmark and Sweden he saw the red-bellied bigtooth among eels and perch. Back in the harbour the exotic fish caused quite an uproar, as several of Lindgreens colleagues were convinced that they were staring at a South American Piranha. Fortunately the fish was sent for study at the Natural History Museum of Denmark. Here Peter Rask Møller and fellow fish expert Henrik Carl examined the animal. Their calming communique for Danish bathers is that the fish is not a Piranha but a close South American relative; the Pacu.Pacu. Photo: Henrik CarlThough the Pacu, like its cousin the Piranha, belongs in waters like the Amazon it has found its way to other waters around the globe by way of aquariums and fish farms. In large parts of the USA and Asia it is now considered an invasive species. It grows to as much as 25 kilograms and is a popular fish for farming and eating. But how this fish ended up in Scandinavian waters is a bit of a puzzler.Some have imagined that it escaped from the recently established The Blue Planet - Denmark's Aquarium. This Copenhagen attraction is situated right next to Oresund and gets its water from there.But that is flat out impossible assures curator at The Blue Planet Lars Skou Olsen.""We do exhibit Pacus in our Amazonas exhibition, but ours are a lot larger than the one caught. And even though the distance between our aquariums and Øresund can be measured in meters there are sophisticated filters in place to avoid contamination. So this is not one of our fish,"" assures Olsen.The usual suspects""Amateur aquarium owners and fish farmers are ""The usual suspects"" when we meet fish where they do not belong,"" says Peter Rask Møller.""It is not unlikely that someone has emptied their fish tank into a nearby stream just before a vacation and that the Pacu then swam out into the brackish waters of Oresund. We don't know of any commercial farming of Pacus in Europe. But just like the Piranhas the Pacus are quite easy for amateurs to raise,"" says Møller.Danish boy Malthe with Pacu. Photo: Henrik CarlOnly once before has a Pacu been caught anywhere in Europe. That was in 2002, when a sportsfisher hooked one near a power plant on the Odra river in Poland.""The river Odra empties into the Baltic Sea very close to Denmark,"" says Peter Rask Møller.The Pacu is known as the peaceful cousin of the Piranha as it is largely vegetarian. Their powerful teeth are not as sharp as those of the Piranhas, but they are fully capable of severing fishing lines and even fingers.""In order to be one hundred percent certain of the identification we will now perform a genetic examination, as there are several species of Pacu which are very similar when young. In the aqua culture busines they even produce hybrids between species,"" explains Peter Rask Møller.The teeth are used mainly to crush nuts and other fruits, but the Pacu eats fish and small invertebrates as well. Its preference for nuts have had fatal results though. In Papua New Guinea where the species has also escaped it is rumoured to have mistaken nuts for male reproductive organs.

President Trump has insisted, despite a lack of evidence, that many immigrants in the United States voted illegally in Virginia, California and New Hampshire.CreditCreditChet Strange for The New York TimesBy Michael D. Shear and Peter BakerJan. 25, 2017WASHINGTON — President Trump intends to move forward with a major investigation of voter fraud that he says cost him the popular vote, White House officials said Wednesday, despite bipartisan condemnation of his allegations and the conclusion of Mr. Trump’s own lawyers that the election was “not tainted.”In his first days in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump has renewed his complaint that millions of people voted illegally, depriving him of a popular-vote majority. In two Twitter posts early Wednesday morning, the president vowed to open an inquiry to reveal people who are registered to vote in multiple states or who remain on voting rolls long after they have died.“We have to understand where the problem exists, how deep it goes, and then suggest some remedies to it,” said Sean Spicer, the president’s press secretary. He said the White House would reveal more details this week.But voting officials in both parties across the country said the answer to those questions is already clear: Fraudulent voting happens in tiny, sporadic episodes that have no impact on the outcome of elections. It is virtually impossible, several state election officials said, that millions of people voted illegally in last year’s presidential contest.In fact, that was the conclusion of Mr. Trump’s own lawyers last year as they sought to stop recount efforts in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.“All available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake,” Mr. Trump’s lawyers wrote in their response to recount petitions by Jill Stein, the Green Party presidential candidate. Mr. Spicer said the lawyers were referring only to states where Mr. Trump campaigned extensively.In Ohio, Secretary of State Jon A. Husted, a Republican, said Wednesday in an interview that there was “no evidence” that voter fraud was happening on a large scale. Edgardo Cortés, Virginia’s election chief, a Democrat, said there was “no basis” for the claims. And California’s Democratic secretary of state lashed out at the president for undermining confidence in the election system.“Free and fair elections are the bedrock of our democracy, and he’s taken a jackhammer to it with his irresponsible tweets,” said Alex Padilla, the state’s top election official. “Whatever proof or evidence he said he had, he clearly didn’t have. His allegations since November are clearly lies, not alternative facts.”Mr. Trump has repeatedly shifted his view of the election system. As a candidate, he frequently railed against what he called a “rigged” election . When he became president-elect, he complained about “serious voter fraud,” but later reversed himself and mocked Ms. Stein’s recount efforts as “a scam” and a waste of time and money.This week, he flip-flopped again, telling lawmakers at a White House reception that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote because millions of immigrants in the country illegally voted for her. Mr. Spicer declined to elaborate on what Mr. Trump meant but did not back away from the assertion.“The president does believe that,” Mr. Spicer said. “It’s a belief that he’s maintained for a while, a concern that he has about voter fraud. And that’s based on information that’s provided.”It remains unclear what form a federal investigation may take. While the F.B.I. has the authority to look into voter fraud, that appears not to be what the president has in mind. Mr. Spicer said it was too early to know, but mentioned the possibility of a task force or commission.He cited studies that he said showed that voter rolls contained the names of millions of people who should not be there because they had moved, were not citizens or had since died. But the author of one of those major studies said Wednesday that Mr. Spicer and the president appeared to be misunderstanding the numbers.David Becker, who for six years was in charge of the election initiative for the Pew Center on the States, said that voter rolls often had out-of-date information, but that there was virtually no evidence that many of those names were used to vote illegally.“It does exist, but it happens in very, very small numbers and nothing like what is claimed by the president,” Mr. Becker said. He said systems across the country to prevent voter fraud would have caught any huge effort to vote illegally. “We would have seen that well before the election,” he said. “We would have seen a swelling of the voter rolls and records.”In Ohio, for example, a review of the state’s elections in 2012 and 2014 found that out of millions of votes cast, there were 667 allegations of fraud, of which just 149 were referred to law enforcement for investigation, Mr. Husted said. The Ohio review, which happens after every election, also found that 436 unauthorized immigrants were registered to vote and that 44 had voted.ImageThe legal team representing then President-elect Donald J. Trump, including Donald F. McGahn II, the current White House counsel, argued in a brief that no voter fraud had occurred in the general election.“Voter fraud exists. It’s not widespread or systemic,” said Mr. Husted, who said he had voted for Mr. Trump. “There’s no evidence that that is happening on a wide-scale basis.”Mr. Husted said he would be happy to share Ohio’s review of the 2016 election with the federal government when it was completed. And he said Mr. Trump could aid states by sharing government databases that could help them clean their voter rolls.In his Twitter message Wednesday, Mr. Trump suggested that a federal review could lead to improvements in voting procedures.But Democrats and voting experts criticized the president for focusing his allegations on voter fraud while resisting the intelligence community’s conclusions involving Russian hacking of the Democratic National Commitee and officials connected to Mrs. Clinton during last year’s election.“It’s more important that we investigate the known instances of election fraud, rather than imagined ones,” said Kim Alexander, the president of the California Voter Foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to improving the voting process. “We have had an election that was compromised by foreign interests. That’s the real danger that has come out of this election.”Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said the president should “knock this off” and move on. “This is going to erode his ability to govern this country if he does not stop it,” he said on CNN .And several Democratic lawmakers and state election officials said they suspected that Mr. Trump’s allegations were part of a plan by Republicans looking for reasons to justify new restrictions on voting to benefit their party, particularly targeting immigrants and African-Americans.“There has been a sustained effort across the country, rooted in similar conspiracies about voter fraud, to make it harder for Americans to vote,” Senator Dianne Feinstein of California said in a statement. “We can’t allow this attack on voting rights to continue, and it’s shameful to see such debunked conspiracy theories emanating from the White House.”Mr. Padilla, the California secretary of state, said he also worried that Mr. Trump’s repeated allegations about fraud would undermine the confidence that Americans had in the integrity of the voting system. “Stoking fear and concern is undermining people’s faith in our elections,” he said.Emmarie Huetteman contributed reporting.Follow The New York Times’s politics and Washington coverage on Facebook and Twitter , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter .A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Pledge to Find Election Fraud Few Say Exists.

Of the roughly 20,000 lions left in the wild, almost all are found in Africa. With one notable exception: the Asiatic lions of the Gir forest.The Asiatic lion (panthera leo persica) is similar in most respects to its African cousins. The most prominent differences are a fold of skin that runs along its belly and a reduced mane in males. About half of the remaining population have a split infraorbital foramen, the hole under the eye socket where facial nerves pass through. It’s thought these differences may be due to inbreeding.Location of Gir National Park. Credit: Wikipedia/MiljoshiUp until the 17th century, Asiatic lions were found as far west as Palestine and throughout Arabia, Persia and Northern India. The spread of firearms and indiscriminate hunting led to their extinction in most of these areas. By the end of the 1800s only a small population remained in Junagadh province on India’s west coast.Once the hunting grounds for the royalty of Junagadh province, the Gir forest became Asiatic lion’s last refuge. In the early 1900s, Nawab Muhammad Rasul Khanji Babi, the ruler at the time, noticed the lions had all but disappeared; he counted only 12 in the entire forest. Fearing their extinction, he declared the Gir a protected area.In 1936, the first official lion census was conducted and found 150 lions. Since then, a census has been taken every five years and has generally shown an upward trend. The most recent census, taken in 2015, counted 523 lions living in the Gir. This was welcome news as the population had grown by about 27 percent from 2010 and suggests conservation measures are having an effect.In 1965, the Indian government declared the Gir forest a wildlife sanctuary. The sanctuary was expanded to cover peripheral forests, and the core area named Gir National Park. Today, the Gir covers a 545 square-mile area of deciduous forest, thorn forest and savannah. It plays host to a number of other large carnivores including leopards, spotted hyenas, honey badgers and golden jackals.Beginning in 1972, human activity was prohibited inside the park. The Maldhari, tribal herdsmen who once supplied milk and cheese to Indian royalty, were relocated and prohibited from grazing their cattle in the forest. The lions and herdsmen had coexisted rather peacefully for centuries even though the lions often poached Maldhari cattle. A study conducted in the mid-1970s found that up to 75 percent of the lion’s diet consisted of livestock.However, concerns about overgrazing, deforestation and the spread of disease to wild ungulates convinced the government to move the Maldhari and their cattle. To discourage harm to lions, as well as forest grazing, the Indian government compensates the herdsmen for cattle killed near the park, but not inside of it.Three cubs Asiatic lion cubs. © Omar Adam KhanWith the Maldhari moved to the periphery, the population of wild ungulates in the Gir has soared. The total number of prey species, such as spotted deer, wild boar, sambar (large deer), blue bull, chinkara (gazelle), and chousingha (four-horned antelope) have increased by 600 percent. As a result, the lions’ diet has shifted. A recent survey of scats (feces) found that only 25 percent of the their diet now consists of domestic cattle.By any measure, the lions of the Gir are a conservation success story. In fact, they may have become too successful, overgrowing the bounds of their sanctuary. As much as 40 percent of the population now lives outside the park bounds in satellite groups. Here, the big cats are at greater risk of death or injury due conflict with people or run-ins with cars or trains. A recent initiative, the Asiatic Lion Reintroduction Project, would take the surplus of lions and move them to a sanctuary in an adjacent Indian state.

The spunky English actress credited the studio head for reviving her career in the U.S. via Weinstein titles like Chocolat, Iris, Mrs. Henderson Presents, and Notes on a Scandal—all of which earned her Oscar nominations—and Shakespeare in Love, for which Dench won the supporting-actress Oscar, in 1999. Committed to the performance—when is she not?—Dench unveiled the faux ink at the Four Seasons over lunch with Weinstein and Charlie Rose . Recalled the actress, “I’ve never seen a man more embarrassed.” But now, at the age of 81, Dench has gone ahead and gotten a tattoo for real.She did not get Weinstein’s name immortally etched into her arm, though. Instead, she got the words “carpe diem” inscribed on her wrist as a gift from her daughter, Finty Williams. In an interview with Surrey Life , Dench explained the ink: “That’s my motto: seize the day. Finty gave it to me for my 81st birthday—she’s wonderful with surprises.”Dench had previously told Good Housekeeping that she was toying with the idea of getting an actual tattoo, but had one hesitation.“There’s an Indian symbol that I like which supposedly represents life and love and everything,” Dench said, explaining what she would have inked onto her arm. “One of the cameramen who worked on The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel told me what it meant, but I’m a bit nervous in case I’m being set up. It might be unbelievably rude.”Dench has been working her way up to the tattoo, between the Weinstein prank and a bejeweled design that she wore to the 2012 premiere of Skyfall. Having played the beloved character “M” since 1995, Dench pledged her allegiance to James Bond by arriving on the red carpet with jewels spelling out “007” on her neck.Get Vanity Fair’s Cocktail HourOur essential brief on culture, the news, and more.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/did-u-s-government-ban-lawn-dart-sales/,the u.s. government banned the sale of lawn darts in the aftermath of a child's death.,True,"['gun control', ' guns', ' lawn darts', ' mass shootings']",https://www.upi.com/,https://www.upi.com/Archives/1988/10/28/Deaths-injuries-prompt-lawn-dart-ban/9940594014400/,2017/10/09,"Deaths, injuries prompt lawn dart banByJANET BASS(0)WASHINGTON -- A federal agency's ban on lawn darts was a bittersweet victory for David Snow, who began a one-man crusade to forbid the product after his 7-year-old daughter died when a lawn dart was thrown into her head.The Consumer Product Safety Commission banned the sale of lawn darts Friday, effective in mid-December, saying the product is not a toy but a dangerous projectile that has caused thousands of injuries and at least three deaths, including that of Snow's daughter, Michelle.'My year-and-a-half struggle is now over,' said Snow, a 40-year-old aerospace production superviser in Riverside, Calif. 'I made seven trips to Washington. I got blisters on my feet. But I just kept at it and today is the payoff. At least now I can say I kept my promise to my little girl.'Michelle Snow died in April 1987 after a dart thrown by another child became embedded in her brain.The ban, approved on a 2-0 vote with one abstention, is the final step on the CPSC's journey to get lawn darts out of the hands of children. Previous regulatory action had required stores to include warnings that the product is for adult-use only. The agency also required stores selling lawn darts to only sell them in sporting goods departments, not toy departments.'In the last 10 years, about 7,000 individuals have required hospital emergency care and a disproportionate number of them have been children,' said CPSC general counsel James Lacy.'For 18 years, the government has sought solutions to prevent children from being severely injured and killed by lawn darts,' said CPSC Commissioner Anne Graham. 'Clearly, the soundest solution is the one we made today.'But officials of the sporting goods industry felt the solution was too drastic.'We felt that a ban is not warranted based on the limited number of fatalities associated with the product,' said Jan Kinney, the Washington director of the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association Inc. 'If used properly, the product poses no safety hazard and that stronger enforcement by the CPSC could have corrected any distribution problem and not denied millions of Americans ... years of recreational enjoyment.'An owner of the only domestic supplier of lawn darts agreed and questioned the agency's fairness.'I think things are wrong with guns. Which is the greater evil - lawn darts that kill three people or guns that kill ... thousands in a year?' asked Bob Archer, one of the owners of Kent Sporting Goods in New London, Ohio.There are about 14 importers of lawn darts and Lacy said CPSC Chairman Terrence Scanlon will inform Customs Service officials of Friday's action to prevent the importation of lawn darts.Lacy described lawn darts as '18 inch-long projectiles with pointed metal or plastic tips that are intended to stick in the ground.' He said they weigh about 1 pounds.Congress passed legislation last week ordering the commission to ban lawn darts. Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., sponsored the legislation, calling the toys 'lethal weapons.' More than 500,000 sets are sold each year.Snow said he has talked with the parents of 11-year-old Amy Herrin of Nashville, Tenn., who has been kept in a deep coma since her cousin accidentally threw a dart into her forehead. Doctors induced the coma to prevent brain swelling after eight hours of surgery to remove the dart.'I knew it would be just a matter of time before I picked up a newspaper and saw it happened again,' Snow said. 'I wanted to prevent this. It's too late for my little girl, but maybe this will be the last one,' he said.Coincidentally, on Oct. 25, Federal Judge Joyce Green ruled in Sears, Roebuck and Co.'s favor on charges brought by CPSC that a Sears store in Puerto Rico violated a March 1988 consent decree involving the sale of lawn darts.Green said Sears had taken all possible steps to comply with the decree and should not be held in contempt of court because of a problem with one store.But Sears and all stores will have to clear their shelves of lawn darts when the ban becomes effective in mid-December, making it difficult for parents to buy lawn darts as last-minute Christmas gifts.Follow us on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram for more UPI news and photos.(0) Leave a comment",2017/10/10,snopes,0

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/russian-tv-host-reports-on-plot-to-kill-trump/,russian television host dmitry kiselyov exposed a plot to kill donald trump,False,"['donald trump', ' election 2016', ' infowars', ' russia today']",http://nymag.com/,http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/04/inside-the-donald-trump-presidential-campaign.html,2016/10/18,"Inside the most unorthodox campaign in political history. On the afternoon of March 15, as voters across five states streamed to the polls, Donald Trump’s campaign advisers gathered by the pool at Mar-a-Lago, the billionaire’s private club in Palm Beach. Hope Hicks, Trump’s 27-year-old press secretary, wearing a cover-up over bikini bottoms, her hair still wet from the pool, scanned headlines on her iPhone next to Trump’s square-jawed campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. That morning, Politico had reported that Trump allies wanted Lewandowski to be fired for roughly grabbing a female reporter while she tried to ask Trump a question at a press conference (an incident for which he has since been charged with battery). Lewandowski didn’t appear to be worried about his job. He was kicking back in a Trump-brand golf shirt, drinking a 16-ounce Monster energy drink, and chatting with deputy campaign manager Michael Glassner, a former Bob Dole adviser, who at age 52 has been seen as the campaign’s grown-up. Dan Scavino, who first earned Trump’s trust as his golf caddie at the Briar Hall club in Westchester and now handles the campaign’s social media, sauntered over in baggy mesh shorts and a baseball cap. “We go to bed and we’re winning, and we wake up and we’re winning!” Scavino said with a cocky smile. There is perhaps no better representation of the singularity of the Trump campaign than this handful of political outsiders lounging poolside. They fit no one’s description of a dream team. Hardly any of Trump’s staffers arrived at their positions with high-level political experience. The last time Lewandowski ran a campaign was in 2002, when he managed a losing Senate reelection bid in New Hampshire. Hicks and Scavino spent zero time in politics before this. Hicks did PR for Ivanka Trump’s fashion line and promoted Trump resorts. Scavino graduated from caddying to serve as general manager at Trump National Golf Club; he spent his free time as an unpaid disc jockey at a local radio station. Trump’s national spokeswoman, Katrina Pierson, is a onetime Obama supporter turned tea-party activist who once was arrested for shoplifting. His foreign-policy advisers include a former banker who writes a foreign-policy blog that quotes Kanye West and Oprah, and an energy consultant whose LinkedIn page cites as a foreign-policy credential being one of five finalists for a model-U.N. summit. “I would take capable over experienced all day long,” Trump said. Furthermore, he’ll take few over many. Trump’s campaign employs a core team of about a dozen people; his campaign lists 94 people on the payroll nationwide, according to the latest Federal Election Commission filing (Hillary Clinton has 765). Trump has no pollsters, media coaches, or speechwriters. He ­focus-groups nothing. He buys few ads, and when he does, he likes to write them himself. He also writes his own tweets, his main vehicle for communicating with his supporters. “I’m the strategist,” Trump told me. Which would make him, no matter what your feelings about his beliefs or his qualifications to govern a country, one of the greatest political savants of the modern era. But now that the race is shifting into a significantly different phase, Trump’s innate talents — and his tiny team — will be challenged. His goal, of course, is to cross the delegate threshold that would guarantee him the nomination before the Republican National Convention in July, but that is nowhere near a sure thing. If he comes up short, he will have to maneuver through an extremely complicated convention, protecting his delegates and making sure the party feels obligated, or cowed enough, to give him the nomination even if it is not legally bound to do so. The focus of the race is changing from what he is naturally good at — riling up the populace — to something closer to what happens on Capitol Hill: horse-trading, negotiating, working levers behind closed doors. Trump may soon need to change how his campaign operates, raising outside money, engaging the super-pacs he has denounced, and widening his circle beyond, essentially, himself. To that end, in late March he hired Paul Manafort, famous in GOP circles for running Gerald Ford’s successful floor fight at the ’76 contested convention, to play delegate hardball. It’s a start, and he is determined. “I’m a closer,” he told me. “I want to close. I have to beat the leftovers. Okay? Inside the pink-marble lobby of Trump Tower, tourists were snapping pictures of the giant waterfall that ripples down the wall of the atrium, while a visiting high-school brass band played in the “Trump Parlor.” At the welcome desk, copies of Trump’s book Crippled America were for sale alongside placards that read make america great again! and the silent majority stands with trump. Security guys patrolled everywhere. The place is a microcosm of Trump’s campaign thus far: cheesy, quaint, and menacing. I left the ostentatious glitz of the lobby and took the elevator to the fifth floor, where two unmarked frosted-glass doors open onto a raw-concrete space with electrical wires and pipes hanging from the ceiling. Sheets of plywood were stacked haphazardly against the walls; plastic buckets and garbage cans were scattered across the floor. It looked like an abandoned construction site. In an unfinished room, I counted seven 20-somethings sitting at scuffed wooden desks and plastic foldout tables. Trump memorabilia festooned the walls. “This is all stuff people sent in,” said an earnest young man in a suit who works in voter outreach. He was sitting under an architectural rendering of the border wall that Trump insists Mexico will pay for. On the floor nearby was a model of the White House topped with a cardboard Trump cutout, American flags, and a pair of pink flamingos. Across the room, a wall of shame featured grim-faced photos of the 13 GOP candidates Trump has so far dispatched, with handwritten dates of their campaigns’ demises. I was well aware that Trump runs a bare-bones operation, but college-newspaper offices have more robust infrastructure than his national campaign headquarters—to say nothing of Hillary Clinton’s 80,000-square-foot headquarters in Brooklyn Heights. As I tried to square all this in my mind, Hope Hicks strode over in five-inch heels. “He’s ready for you.” We took the elevator to the 26th floor. “It’s been so crazy,” she said. A guard outside Trump’s executive suite waved a wand over me before opening the locked doors. Trump stood and shook my hand, wearing his usual uniform: crisp navy suit and bright-red tie. Not surprisingly, given the state of the race — this was a few days after Trump trounced Marco Rubio in Florida — his mood was good, boastful even. “So much for the face of the Republican Party—that’s the end of that!” he said of Rubio. “He was going to be president. By the way, Jeb Bush was going to be president. Walker was going to be president. Trump turned to Hicks. “So I’ve won 20. Cruz has won five. And I see Cruz on television last night saying, ‘I have proven I can beat Donald Trump!’ He didn’t say I beat him 20 times! I asked him about the lines that have become his signature. In most other campaigns there are speechwriters (and pollsters) for this. But there is clearly no team of comedy writers squirreled away downstairs. “I’m the writer,” Trump said. “Let me start with Little Marco. He just looked like Little Marco to me. And it’s not Little. It’s Liddle. L-I-D-D-L-E. And it’s not L-Y-I-N-G Ted Cruz. It’s L-Y-I-N apostrophe. All his utterances are, by his account, spontaneous. “It’s much easier to read a speech, obviously,” he said. In person, it’s difficult to see exactly where Trump the man blurs into Trump the character. He moves in and out of his bellowing stump-speech persona and his “normal” persona, which is the same in many ways, just dialed down a few notches. There is, however, a vulnerability to Trump in private that you don’t often see; he comes across as genuinely wounded that he’s not taken seriously. Rubio, he said, “talked about my hands because he had nothing else to talk about. I said to him, ‘It’s pretty sad when after the long career I’ve had the best he can do is talk about my hands,’ which are really good.” Trump paused and spread his five fingers for me to inspect. He seemed particularly upset that his fellow billionaires don’t show him respect. “Murdoch’s been very bad to me,” he said. “Bloomberg’s been quite bad to me. I thought he was a friend of mine; he’s no friend of mine. “I just wanted to show you something,” said the man, indicating that he would come back later. It was a reminder that Trump is ostensibly still running a business through all this. Later, Hicks would tell me about the time they were driving to a campaign event when Ivanka called to update Trump on a development. “He said, ‘Go with the marble. Now I have to run, baby. Trump deflected most questions about policy (“I have policy on my website”), strategy (“I think I’ll win before the convention”), and controversies around his campaign (“It’s totally blown out by the press. There’s very little violence”). He said he would choose a politician as his running mate — “I don’t want to have two people outside of politics” — but he wouldn’t name any possibilities. What he talked about most was winning. It’s a truism, but it’s still true: His worldview is that life is a contest, and he’s been winning it for years. “I always get good crowds,” he said. “I’ve always had ratings from the time I was born, for whatever reason. It hasn’t, you know, just started. The Apprentice went on, and no one thought it would be successful.” The transition in our conversation from his presidential run to his reality-TV show was seamless. “In fact, get up, Gabe, take a look there, see the picture on the wall—Variety. I mean, No. 1 show on television. You remember how amazing that was. That wasn’t a surprise to me, but everyone else in show business couldn’t believe it. ‘Wow, you got the No. 1 show on television!’ ” In this conversation, The Apprentice was the subject that had him most animated. As much as his campaign appears off the cuff, Trump diligently laid the groundwork for his 2016 run over the course of several years, cultivating relationships with powerful allies in the conservative firmament and in the media, inviting them to private meetings at Trump Tower and golf outings in Florida, all the while collecting intelligence that he has deployed to devastating effect. As early as 1987, Trump talked publicly about his desire to run for president. He toyed with mounting a campaign in 2000 on the Reform Party ticket, and again in 2012 as a Republican (this was at the height of his Obama birtherism). Two years later, Trump briefly explored running for governor of New York as a springboard to the White House. “I have much bigger plans in mind — stay tuned,” he tweeted in March 2014. Trump taped another season of The Apprentice that year, but he kept a political organization intact. His team at the time consisted of three advisers: Roger Stone, Michael Cohen, and Sam Nunberg. Stone is a veteran operative, known for his gleeful use of dirty tricks and for ending Eliot Spitzer’s political career by leaking his patronage of prostitutes to the FBI. Cohen is Trump’s longtime in-house attorney. And Nunberg is a lawyer wired into right-wing politics who has long looked up to “Mr. Trump,” as he calls him. “I first met him at Wrestle­Mania when I was like 5 years old,” Nunberg told me. Throughout 2014, the three fed Trump strategy memos and political intelligence. “I listened to thousands of hours of talk radio, and he was getting reports from me,” Nunberg recalled. What those reports said was that the GOP base was frothing over a handful of issues including immigration, Obamacare, and Common Core. While Jeb Bush talked about crossing the border as an “act of love,” Trump was thinking about how high to build his wall. “We either have borders or we don’t,” Trump told the faithful who flocked to the annual CPAC conference in 2014. Meanwhile, Trump used his wealth as a strategic tool to gather his own intelligence. When Citizens United president David Bossie or GOP chairman Reince Priebus called Trump for contributions, Trump used the conversations as opportunities to talk about 2016. “Reince called Trump thinking they were talking about donations, but Trump was asking him hard questions,” recalled Nunberg. From his conversations with Priebus, Trump learned that the 2016 field was likely to be crowded. “We knew it was going to be like a parliamentary election,” Nunberg said. Which is how Trump’s scorched-earth strategy coalesced. To break out of the pack, he made what appears to be a deliberate decision to be provocative, even outrageous. “If I were totally presidential, I’d be one of the many people who are already out of the race,” Trump told me. And so, Trump openly stoked racial tensions and appealed to the latent misogyny of a base that thinks of Hillary as the world’s most horrible ballbuster. It was also thanks to some information he had gathered that Trump was able to do something that no other Republican has done before: take on Fox News. An odd bit of coincidence had given him a card to play against Fox founder Roger Ailes. In 2014, I published a biography of Ailes, which upset the famously paranoid executive. Several months before it landed in stores, Ailes fired his longtime PR adviser Brian Lewis, accusing him of being a source. During Lewis’s severance negotiations, Lewis hired Judd Burstein, a powerhouse litigator, and claimed he had “bombs” that would destroy Ailes and Fox News. That’s when Trump got involved. “When Roger was having problems, he didn’t call 97 people, he called me,” Trump said. Burstein, it turned out, had worked for Trump briefly in the ’90s, and Ailes asked Trump to mediate. Trump ran the negotiations out of his office at Trump Tower. “Roger had lawyers, very expensive lawyers, and they couldn’t do anything. I solved the problem.” Fox paid Lewis millions to go away quietly, and Trump, I’m told, learned everything Lewis had planned to leak. If Ailes ever truly went to war against Trump, Trump would have the arsenal to launch a retaliatory strike. In January 2015, Trump hired Corey Lewandowski as campaign manager at the recommendation of Citizen United’s Bossie. On paper, Lewandowski’s credentials didn’t shine, but what he lacked in pedigree he made up for in raw ambition and ruthlessness. Lewandowski grew up poor in the mill town of Lowell, Massachusetts. As an undergraduate at the local UMass branch, he ran unsuccessfully for state representative. After graduating in 1995, he moved to Washington, D.C., got a master’s in politics at American University, and worked as a House aide on Capitol Hill. In 2001, he got a job with the Republican National Committee. But Lewandowski’s time as a member of the GOP Establishment was short-lived. In 2002, he managed the reelection campaign of New Hampshire Republican senator Bob Smith, who was loathed by George W. Bush’s White House for briefly leaving the party in 1999 to launch an independent run for president. Against Smith, the Bushes backed John Sununu Jr., the son of George H. W. Bush’s former chief of staff. “I told Corey that the Establishment is coming after me, even the president of the United States,” Smith said, recalling his interview with Lewandowski for the job. Smith lost, and Lewandowski, as Smith had warned, found himself cast into the political wilderness. He settled in New Hampshire, got married, and raised four children while bouncing around a series of jobs, at one point selling real estate and serving as a police officer. In 2008, he landed a position with Americans for Prosperity, the Koch-brothers-backed free-market group. Lewandowski rose through the ranks at AFP to become national director of voter registration but stalled after a voter-recruitment project he spearheaded failed to yield results in 2014. Politico also reported that Lewandowski once threatened to “blow up” a colleague’s car and even called a female co-worker a “cunt.” One former Koch executive told me he was going to be fired. Luckily, Trump came calling. He hired Lewandowski thinking that the 42-year-old operative had two crucial assets: his Koch connections and an intimate knowledge of New Hampshire’s quirky political terrain. The first assumption was wrong, but on the second, Lewandowski proved his worth. And he gained Trump’s trust by demonstrating he possessed the quality Trump values most: loyalty. “This campaign, above all other things, is about loyalty,” Lewandowski said. Trump turned to an equally unlikely candidate to handle communications. One day in January 2015, Hope Hicks got a call from Trump’s office asking her to come in. At the time, she was working on the 25th floor with Ivanka. “Mr. Trump looked at me and said, ‘I’m thinking about running for president, and you’re going to be my press secretary,’ ” Hicks said. “I think it’s ‘the year of the outsider.’ It helps to have people with outsider perspective.” Her mother told her she should write a book about this experience someday. Six months later, Lewandowski and Hicks worked into the early hours of the morning prepping for Trump’s campaign announcement in the lobby of Trump Tower. “It had to be perfect,” Lewandowski said. “We had to build the stage, make sure the flags hung perfectly; the eagles faced out; the carpet was red, and he would wear a red tie.” And hire plants. The campaign paid actors $50 each to wear Trump T-shirts and wave placards. Later that morning, they watched from the wings as Ivanka introduced her father in front of reporters and photographers and the manufactured crowd. “It looked like the Academy Awards!” Trump recalled. “You saw the cameras, forget it. Trump didn’t read a prepared speech, but he knew what he wanted to say, which hardly mattered anyway because hardly anyone took his candidacy seriously at the time. “Nobody said anything,” Trump said about the fact that he had accused Mexico of sending “rapists” over the border into the U.S. “Then two weeks later, they started saying, ‘Wait a minute! He hadn’t tested the line, but Nunberg’s deep dive into talk radio had shown him that this was the sort of thing that would resonate with a certain segment of the Republican base. He also knew that this kind of outrageous statement would earn him the free media attention ($1.9 billion worth and counting, according to the New York Times) that would propel his campaign. This strategy did not go over well in all corners of the Trump empire. Ivanka, Trump’s 34-year-old daughter, had carefully tended her public image as the softer, more refined face of the Trump empire. Now her father’s hard-edged nativist rhetoric risked damaging not only her brand but her business. A few days after the announcement speech, Ivanka received a terse email from Kimberly Grant, the CEO of ThinkFood Group, the holding company behind celebrity chef José Andrés, whose restaurant was supposed to be the anchor tenant in one of Ivanka’s biggest projects: the $200 million redevelopment of the Old Post Office in Washington, D.C., into a luxury hotel. “We need to talk. Getting crushed over DJT comments about Latinos and Mexicans,” Grant wrote her, according to legal filings. Ivanka forwarded Grant’s email to her executives. “Ugh,” one responded. “This is not surprising and would expect that this will not be the last that we hear of it. At least for formal, prepared speeches, can someone vet going forward? Ivanka’s older brother, Donald Jr., also weighed in. “Yea I was waiting for that one. Ivanka did her best to salvage the partnership. She asked her father to issue an apology, even submitting several drafts for him to release to the press. But he refused. “Rapists are coming into the country! You know I was right,” Trump later told me. On July 8, Andrés backed out of the restaurant deal, citing Trump’s immigration comments. The two sides are now battling in court. Despite any differences of opinion, Ivanka is by all accounts thrilled at the possibility of her dad becoming president. She managed to persuade him to support Planned Parenthood—at least the part of the organization that doesn’t provide abortions—an extreme position for a Republican to take. “She’s very much into the concept of women’s health issues,” Trump said. “No one can control him,” said Nunberg. Not even his family. Ivanka’s husband, the real-estate scion and Observer owner Jared Kushner, has also gotten involved in the campaign, serving as an emissary to the Jewish community. He helped plan Trump’s trip to Israel last December, though it didn’t go exactly as planned. When Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized Trump’s proposal to halt Muslim immigration, Trump canceled the trip. “This was all your idea!” Trump scolded his son-in-law, according to a source. He fared better with Trump’s AIPAC speech, which Kushner wrote with input from Observer editor Ken Kurson. It was one of the most subdued of his public statements so far, perhaps because it was the only one he has read from a Teleprompter. Kushner has tapped his network in an attempt to help his father-in-law. He reached out to hedge-fund billionaire Paul Singer to introduce him to Trump (Singer declined), and during Trump’s feud with Fox, he called Rupert Murdoch to try to make peace (Murdoch told him to deal directly with Roger Ailes). But this is where Kushner’s involvement makes for the strangest of bedfellows. One of Trump’s most prominent endorsers, Chris Christie, happens to be the man who, as U.S. attorney, sent Jared’s father, Charles Kushner, to federal prison for tax fraud, among other felonies, in 2004. One way in which Trump’s campaign is like others is that its advisers have jousted for primacy. Over the summer, Lewandowski became embroiled in a battle for control with Stone, Nunberg, and Cohen. The principal fault line was over Stone and Nunberg’s belief that Trump needed to invest money into building a real campaign infrastructure and Lewandowski’s contention that their current approach was working fine. On July 31, the dispute spilled into public view when Business Insider published an article revealing racist Facebook posts Nunberg had written years earlier. Nunberg believed Lewandowski was involved in the leak, hoping to use it as a pretext to force him out of the campaign. “I have been told by past colleagues that he has bragged about ‘ratfucking’ me in private,” Nunberg said. Lewandowski adamantly disputes this. “I am denying 150 percent on my kids’ lives that I had anything to do with it,” he said. Trump is not usually one to be put off by a few racist tweets, but Lewandowski convinced Trump that Nunberg needed to go. (Nunberg now supports Ted Cruz.) A week later, Stone quit, although he continues to advise Trump informally. Cohen remains in the Trump organization but is no longer part of the core political team. Having won the power struggle with Nunberg and Stone, Lewandowski focused on letting “Trump be Trump,” which is what Trump wanted too. There would be no expensive television ad campaigns, no bus tours or earnest meet-and-greets at greasy spoons. Instead, the cornerstones of Trump’s strategy are stadium rallies and his ubiquitous presence on television and social media. “Mr. Trump is the star,” Hicks said. Pundits have scoffed at this. Trump has no “ground game,” they say. His refusal to spend money on television ads spells disaster. But from the beginning, Trump knew he was onto something. “I remember I had one event in New Hampshire right next to Bush,” Trump told me. “I had 4,500 people, many people standing outside in the cold. Bush had 67 people! Right next door! The Trump team is on the road — or rather in the air — five to six days a week on average. Lewandowski, Hicks, Scavino, Donald Jr., and security chief Keith Schiller travel with Trump, while Glassner often stays behind at headquarters. When they travel, they live on the plane, returning to New York or Palm Beach at night whenever possible, even if it means flying in at 2 or 3 a.m. When they’re in New York, Hicks spends most of her day sitting in Trump’s office with her laptop, fielding press inquiries and taking dictation from him to tweet. Lewandowski spends most of his time in the campaign office, organizing logistics. He’s said to approve every invoice himself. Trump has given them both free apartments at a nearby Trump building. The small scale and near-constant proximity mean they can respond to events quickly. In February, when the pope suggested Trump might not be a Christian owing to his plan to build a wall along the border, the campaign struck back within minutes. “If and when the Vatican is attacked by isis, which as everyone knows is isis’s ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been president,” his statement said. Lewandowski recalled how it happened: “We found out about it as Mr. Trump was giving a speech on Kiawah Island in South Carolina, and within three minutes or less, he provided the response to Hope.” (By contrast, Clinton’s tweets are vetted by layers of advisers. But if speed is the advantage of the small campaign, insularity is its inherent disadvantage. By all accounts, Trump doesn’t seek much counsel beyond his staff and children. There is, of course, his circle of declared foreign-policy advisers whom no one had heard of, but it’s unclear how much he talks to those he cites publicly. Carl Icahn told me that Trump didn’t call him before he invoked his name as a potential Cabinet member. “I saw one day he was on TV talking about making Carl Icahn secretary of the Treasury,” Icahn said. A conservative source close to the campaign told me that Trump only truly consults one person, Alabama Republican senator Jeff Sessions: “When Jeff Sessions calls, Trump listens.” It’s hard to overstate Sessions’s influence on trade and immigration policy within the GOP. As far back as 2007, Sessions led the right-wing revolt to scuttle comprehensive immigration reform. Trump set out to win his endorsement early, calling him shortly after he launched his campaign and asking him to advise him. Then, while in D.C. for the anti-Iran-nuclear-deal protest in September, he met privately with Sessions in the basement of the Capitol. “That was a very long meeting,” recalled Stephen Miller, then an adviser to Sessions. Trump stayed in contact with Sessions throughout the fall and in January strengthened ties by hiring Miller to serve as his campaign’s policy adviser. A 30-year-old Duke philosophy grad, Miller grew up liberal in Los Angeles but converted to the right as a teenager after reading NRA president Wayne LaPierre’s book Guns, Crime and Freedom. He said Trump inspires him. “I am here because in the bottom of my heart I see this election as a last-chance election,” he told me. Since then, Trump and Sessions seem only to have grown closer. Sessions stood with Trump onstage near Huntsville just before the Alabama primary in late February. And when Sessions called Trump last month and criticized him for coming out in favor of H-1B visas, which allow companies to recruit high-level talent abroad, Trump promptly changed his position. “Sessions has told him to get off the personal attacks,” the source told me. Meanwhile, the Trump team has poured almost all of its efforts into producing rallies down to the most minute details. At a Christmas-themed one I attended in Cedar Rapids in December, eight perfectly symmetrical Christmas trees lined the stage. As Lewandowski told me, “It’s all about the visual.” He requires reporters to stay behind metal barricades and positions television cameras for the most dramatic shots. “We want to know, what does it look like when he walks out on the stage?” Lewandowski said. “Sometimes we’ll allow cameras up close, sometimes we’ll show Mr. Trump on the rope line.” And the networks, hungry for ratings, have played by these strict rules. Trump is personally very invested in the theater of the campaign. In August, his private 757 buzzed a football stadium in Mobile, Alabama, that was packed with 30,000 supporters. “I was sitting up front,” Trump recalled, “and I saw a tremendous crowd of people. I went up to the pilot, I said, ‘Hack a left here and go right over.’ And the people went crazy. It’s my instinct.” In Florida last month, Trump’s helicopter hovered over a rally in Boca Raton. After the rallies, Trump makes sure his fans stay mobilized. Everyone who attends a rally has to register by email, and the campaign uses this list, which Lewandowski estimates is “in the millions at this point,” to turn out voters. Most campaigns spend a lot of money to acquire voter lists; Trump largely built his own. “If you look at what the Obama campaign achieved many years ago, they were successful at bringing new people in, and then communicating with those people. What we’re doing is not dissimilar,” Lewandowski explained. “He had a brilliant plan, which was to go in and attract huge crowds,” added Ed McMullen, Trump’s South Carolina co-chair. “We had extremely strong interaction with them, and we were dedicated to keeping track of who those people were.” Trump supporters receive frequent email updates and phone calls from phone-bank volunteers. Trump has refined the rally concept over the course of the campaign. To save time and money, he now does events at airports. “We’ll take a hangar because it’s not as expensive as a ballroom,” Trump said. “Look at the rally we did in Mesa, Arizona, December 16th,” added Hicks. “That was the first one when we pulled the plane in and ‘Air Force One’ [the theme song of the 1997 movie starring Harrison Ford] was playing. It’s efficient. His ad strategy, too, is inexpensive. Trump has aired only six unique TV commercials, according to Hicks, while his GOP rivals have aired more than two dozen separate ads each. Through February, he spent only $10 million on ads; Jeb Bush spent $82 million. Trump relies mostly on essentially free Instagram spots produced by 29-year-old Justin McConney, the son of Trump’s corporate comptroller, whom Trump put in charge of building his social-media profile a few years ago. Trump is cheap, and proud of it. Indeed, Lewandowski’s bonus for winning New Hampshire was a paltry $50,000. It’s part of Trump’s central argument: He will run the government like a business. (Though, truth be told, there are few businesses that operate the way his does: Trump’s company is primarily a marketing vehicle at this point, licensing his name to other firms’ developments.) “I don’t spend much money,” he told me. “In New Hampshire, I spent $2 million” — actually $3.7 million — “Bush spent $48 million” — actually $36.1 million — “I came in first in a landslide, he came in sixth” — actually fourth. This formula has worked thus far better than anyone, including Trump, could have imagined. When he launched his campaign, Trump suspected it would eventually fizzle and he would return to The Apprentice. “You know, when I first got into this, it was for other reasons,” he told a friend. As weeks and then months passed with him remaining out front, he began to think winning the nomination was a real possibility, even as he resisted calls to professionalize his campaign. Why bother, when what he was doing was working so well? But now the cracks are starting to show. Lewandowski’s criminal charge is just the latest self-inflicted setback for the campaign. There was also the canceled Chicago rally that sparked a near riot; Trump’s inability to blunt the criticism over Trump University; and his woefully unprepared performances recently before the Washington Post and New York Times. Until last week, when Trump hired Manafort to oversee his delegate strategy, there was virtually no serious plan to wage a battle for delegates in anticipation of a contested convention. As of now, Cruz may secure more delegates in Louisiana despite losing to Trump in the primary (Trump says he’ll sue over this). A Republican official in Texas recently told Breitbart News Network that Trump has no visible delegate operation in the state. “I’ll buy the delegates,” Trump joked to a friend over dinner. Trump demurred when I asked him about his strategy to win the nomination at a contested convention. “I have people looking at it,” he said. What about his intimation that there will be riots in the streets if he loses on a second ballot? “You will have a lot of very unhappy people,” he said coyly. The threat is thinly veiled given the violence associated with his campaign, especially after he told NBC he’d consider paying the legal fees of a white supporter who punched a black protester in the face. One explanation for all this raggedness is that the Trump team is simply burned out. People who know Trump say they’ve never seen him so tired. Several months ago, he began wearing a bulletproof vest, two sources close to the campaign told me, which has added to his discomfort on the stump, leaving him sweaty and spent after events. And given that his unfavorables among women already are at ruinous levels (a CNN poll last month found that 73 percent of registered female voters held a negative view of Trump), his ill-advised comments about punishing abortion-seekers seem like they might have been a function of sheer exhaustion as well. Outrageous comments may have gotten him attention early on, but now Trump is talking about pivoting. “I’ll have to expand the team and the theme,” he told me. Some have speculated that the arrival of Manafort and the shifting strategy of the campaign mean that Lewandowski’s role will be reduced, and not just because of the battery charge. People inside Trump’s world, while praising Lewandowski’s talents as an advance man, are privately expressing doubts about his strategic abilities. One prominent conservative told me Trump surrogate Jerry Falwell Jr. complained about Lewandowski’s brusque demeanor. Another source told me Ivanka doesn’t think Lewandowski can handle the pressures of the next stage and has told her father as much. “Generally, her feeling is he’s low-level and doesn’t have a good rep and is not going to bring her father to the next level,” the source explained. A third source close to the campaign suggested Glassner is taking a more hands-on role. Recently, he persuaded Trump to dump the campaign’s data analyst and recruit a more experienced consultant. But publicly, Trump is still standing by Lewandowski, coming to his defense after the battery charge. If Trump makes it to the nomination, he will face other challenges for which he seems right now completely unprepared. He’ll have to rally at least some of the GOP Establishment, which he’s spent the last year vilifying. “People are calling me, that you have interviewed, that you see on television, who have total disdain for Donald Trump, and they’re calling to see if they can join the Trump train,” he said. During one conversation, he told me Paul Ryan called him “very nicely, twice.” But when I later checked that with Ryan’s communications adviser, Brendan Buck, he said the two spoke only once and it was after Trump’s office called. In recent days, Trump named a new “House Leadership Committee” headed by Republicans Duncan Hunter and Chris Collins. On March 31, he sat down with Priebus at RNC headquarters. There are plans to open a D.C. campaign office. He will also have to figure out how to raise money. Trump won’t fund a general election himself, and he has no national fund-raising apparatus in place. During my tour of Trump’s campaign office, I overheard Glassner on the phone discussing the nascent state of their finance efforts. “I have to find a place for these rich guys to go to,” he said. “Dinners, receptions, events. We need everything, because we don’t have a finance committee.” It will be a hard sell for Trump, one of the hardest of his career, to persuade GOP donors to pony up, especially after his attacks on the donor class. Groups like the Club for Growth have been committed to stopping Trump. And the Koch brothers have also been unhappy; the assumption is that they will sit this election cycle out. In February, Trump got some encouraging news when Sheldon Adelson said at a Las Vegas gala that he would support Trump if he were the nominee. The campaign has been talking to veteran GOP fund-raiser Ray Washburne about taking outside money, according to the Washington Post. Trump perked up when I asked him about the prospect of running against Hillary Clinton, as if that were the thing he looks forward to more than anything. “Oh, I’m the only one who will beat Hillary,” he said. “Look what happened two months ago when she brought up the sexist thing about me. They went into a deep coma. They had a rough weekend, the two of them.” He began to impersonate a conversation between Bill and Hillary. “He’s saying, ‘Why did you say that?’ And she’s saying, ‘You sonofabitch.’ Because of his past problems.” Trump smiled. A confluence of factors created the conditions for this election and Trump’s surprising success in it: the turbulence of economic change, anxiety about terrorism, the rise of social media, Obama-inspired racism, Hillary-inspired misogyny, resistance to all manner of social change; the list can go on and on. But one factor that’s been particularly crucial to Trump’s rise may be the way that reality television, cable news, and talk radio have shaped the culture’s sense of “reality” — in other words, its relationship to truth. If Ronald Reagan showed us that Hollywood was good training for politics, Trump is proving that the performance skills one learns in the more modern entertainment arenas are even more useful. Talk and reality shows are improvised operations, mastered by larger-than-life personalities expert at distorting and provoking, shifting and commandeering attention. As Trump sees it, his television instincts are better than any of the network executives. “CNN is up 75 percent because of me. Call Jeff Zucker and you ask him. Because of me. You know 1010 wins? They say ‘All news all the time.’ CNN is called ‘All Trump all the time.’ ” The same goes for Roger Ailes. But a couple of things happen when reality­-TV standards are applied to politics: One is that the level of sleaze gets so high that nothing is shocking — casual racism, misogyny, a campaign manager charged with battery, allegations about candidates’ affairs or sexual orientations, constant gossip about “even worse” revelations on all sides to come (“Tune in next week!”). This primary season would seem implausible if it were fiction. But as reality TV, it’s spot-on. The other phenomenon is that everyone is assumed to be playing a role at some level, so it’s hard to tell what is real and what is just for attention. Trump has already started using this as a strategy to help him try to pivot to the general election. Those terrible things he said about and to women while playing himself on The Apprentice? Oh, he was just in character. He was playing “himself,” not being himself. The way he acted so unpresidentially in the primary? Oh, that was just to break out of the pack of all those pesky other candidates with some good ol’ provocation. And aren’t you glad? Because now that the field is almost clear, he can start to be presidential. But I suspect Trump will have a hard time pivoting — not because of what he has said in the past, but because this is the script he knows best. He has been cultivating the character of “Donald Trump” for decades now, and it seems apparent that he can’t turn it off. Back at Trump Tower, it was striking how often he kept going back to the well of The Apprentice, unprompted. “They wanted to renew The Apprentice with me so badly,” he told me. “Steve Burke” — CEO of NBCUniversal — “good guy, came out and sat right in that chair along with the head of NBC. ‘Please, please, I want you to renew. The Apprentice, after 14 seasons, is still a big hit.’ I said I’m not going to do it, because I’m going to run for president. They didn’t believe it, so they renewed anyway. Then I ran. Now they have Arnold Schwarzenegger. Let’s see how Arnold does. He talked about it almost wistfully. Now that his campaign seems more vulnerable, I can’t help but wonder if sometimes he wishes he could go back to a reality show where he can’t be fired.",2016/04/04,snopes,0

Refuse Fascism is publishing the written notes for a presentation that Andy Zee, a member of the Advisory Board of Refuse Fascism, made to a national meeting of leaders of Refuse Fascism. After discussion, the meeting affirmed the decision to issue the Call for November 4 and developed plans for Regional Conferences on August 19 to build and organize for November 4. Andy Zee began by reading the Call for November 4, which we are reprinting below. His speech follows. NO! This Nightmare Must End: The Trump/Pence Regime Must Go! In the Name of Humanity, We REFUSE to Accept a Fascist America! Immigrants living in terror—their next step could mean detention, deportation, being torn from children and loved ones. Muslims and refugees demonized, banned and cast out. Millions—children, the elderly, the sick, the poor—denied healthcare, food assistance, the very right to live. Women objectified, degraded, and denied the basic right to control their own reproduction with fundamentalist Christian fascism increasingly being made law. LGBTQ people stigmatized, ostracized, and denied civil rights recently won. Black and Latino people openly threatened by the President, with maximum sentencing, stop-and-frisk going national, intensified police brutality and murder of our youth with no holds barred. People all over the world facing bombings, occupations, war and the threat of nuclear war with Donald Trump’s “America First” finger on the nuclear trigger. The truth bludgeoned—lies and more lies—critical thinking being destroyed in education and public discourse. The whole planet in peril from a regime that denies global warming and shreds all environmental protections. A regime step by step discarding basic democratic rights, targeting group after group, and suppressing dissent and resistance. A regime unleashing the violence of fascist thugs. This is fascism—a qualitative change in how society is governed. History has shown that fascism must be stopped before it becomes too late. THIS NIGHTMARE MUST END. Millions feel this and ache with the question of how to stop this unrelenting horror. The stakes are nothing less than the future of humanity and the planet itself. Who will end this nightmare? We will. Only the determined struggle of millions of people acting together with courage and conviction can drive this regime from power. Only the determined struggle of millions of people acting together with courage and conviction can drive this regime from power. This Nightmare Must End: the Trump/Pence Regime Must Go! Our actions will reflect the values of respect for all of humanity and the world we want—in stark contrast to the hate and bigotry of the Trump/Pence fascist regime. Our determination to persist and not back down will compel the whole world to take note. Every force and faction in the power structure would be forced to respond to our demand. The cracks and divisions among the powers already evident today will sharpen and widen. As we draw more and more people forward to stand up, all of this could lead to a situation where this illegitimate regime is removed from power. Spread the word and organize now. Be a part of making history. Don’t let it be said that you stood aside when there was still a chance to stop a regime that imperils humanity and the Earth itself. Join in taking to the streets and the public squares day after day and night after night demonstrating that In the Name of Humanity, We REFUSE to Accept a Fascist America. This Nightmare Must End: The Trump/Pence Regime Must GO! On November 4, 2017, We Begin, This Nightmare Must End: The Trump/Pence Regime Must GO! Available in 40x60"" & 36x54"" sizes. These hard hitting posters are an indictment of what the Trump/Pence Regime has done and is doing. They concentrate the facts of the regime’s efforts to consolidate fascism. They drive home why, in the interests of humanity, the Trump/Pence Regime “Must GO!” People are being led by mass media to think “Trump really hasn’t been able to accomplish anything yet.” People need a much fuller grasp of the aims of this regime, and the direction it is pushing in. “This Nightmare Must End” captures how millions of people feel right now. This feeling is at times inchoate and, at others, it enrages. It disturbs sleep, dominates conversation. For immigrants and Muslims it is terror that is lived—a foreboding pervading every aspect of life. Where you never know if this is the day you will be snatched from family and the life you have made—perhaps to be returned to a place you don’t know where you may face persecution or even death. Millions of people agonize over every move of the regime and they worry about the specter of worse to come. They feel trapped in the kind of nightmare from which you desperately need an escape—desperately hoping to wake up so as to put the terror behind you. Adding “This Nightmare Must End” to our demand speaks very broadly to how people feel. People feel that somehow this must end and yearn for a way out. Refuse Fascism is the hope and the way to drive the Trump/Pence Regime from power. What people don’t know, and need to know, is that THEY ARE THE WAY OUT OF THE NIGHTMARE, if they join together and act outside all the normal avenues that they expect society and government to provide for redress of their concerns—outside the ways that they would normally think of to act themselves for remedy. Waiting for investigations, waiting for the Democrats to act, thinking that Trump will implode, hoping for 2018 Congressional elections, even protesting each abuse—as righteous and part of people raising their heads as such protest is, these are all acting within the normal frameworks that people have grown accustomed to thinking and acting within for change in policy and direction. But change, even under “normal” times, rarely comes without ferocious struggle if it is not change in the interests of at least some of those in power. BUT EVEN MORE, THERE IS NOTHING NORMAL ABOUT THE TRUMP/PENCE REGIME. FASCISM IS NOT NORMAL. Refuse Fascism is up against what society is up against. Fascism is not the normal way that this country has been ruled. While more and more people are coming to see the qualitative change that the Trump/Pence Regime is bringing, we have a society-wide struggle to wage with people to recognize and come to grips with the reality that with the election of Trump there is a fascist qualitative change in the social, political, and cultural norms of how this society is governed and ruled. The abnormality of Trump consistently gets focused on his narcissistic psychology and/or his financial and other misdeeds, and what is not confronted is the radical tearing up of the norms of society and in its place new fascist norms being cemented into place. Again, there is a break with what have been the norms we confront, and to deal with this there must be a break with the “normal” ways people seek change from government. The normal forms of petition and protest DO NOT APPLY with Trump—even as they have been difficult enough under the normal functioning of this system. So we constantly hear the talking heads on cable news, or commentators on social media critiquing and mocking Trump’s outrageous tweets and utterances, his disregard for the truth, his overall buffoonery and his flaunting of the norms of society. And they not only gloss over the full scale and scope of his program and almost never mention its fascist character, but they also consistently “advise” the regime on how to govern “normally.” THE PROBLEM is Trump glories in breaking the norms—and that is why he was elected by a social base that has been riled up for decades behind a racist, misogynist, anti-immigrant program. They believe Trump’s outsider outrageousness and his flaunting of the norms shows that he can and will deliver. The program of the Democrats and their media mouthpieces is restoring the norms. So people who hate and oppose the regime are being led to look to all the ways I mentioned before: elections, hearings, investigations, and protest as usual to “make their voices heard,” as if we are dealing with a normal regime. We are not. We need to learn from those times in the history of this country, and from around the world, when people stepped outside the normal channels to struggle for their demand. Just this past winter tens, and then hundreds, of thousands of people took to the streets in the capital of South Korea—eventually every day and night—to demand the ouster of the president. After almost four months, they succeeded. We should recognize, and hold firmly to, our demand that the whole REGIME must go. This is a tremendous strength of Refuse Fascism. No one else, no other organization, has raised this demand. Yet, many are paralyzed at the thought of Trump being removed and ending up with Mike Pence. Their repulsion at Pence is warranted. Pence is now the political leader of a theocratic Christian fundamentalism—that we should more accurately call Christian fascism. Decades in the making, the roots of this are gone into extensively in The Truth About Right-Wing Conspiracy… And Why Clinton and the Democrats Are No Answer and The Coming Civil War, both by Bob Avakian, the Chairman of the Revolutionary Communist Party and architect of the new synthesis of communism. This past week, two Catholic Vatican scholars close to Pope Francis warned U.S. Catholics that the Christian evangelicalism of the Trump/Pence Regime is “not too far apart” from the kind of Islamic fundamentalism that is tearing up the Mideast. The Trump/Pence Regime is saturated with and dependent on this Christian fascist social base, and already they have made huge strides in implementing their agenda, with catastrophic impact on the lives of women and LGBTQ people as well as on medicine, healthcare, and public education. Impact that will disproportionately hurt communities of oppressed nationalities. Christian fascism runs through this regime, from Steve Bannon’s world apocalyptic view of a war for Western (read white) Judeo-Christian civilization on through the Trump cabinet with Rick Perry, Betsy DeVos, Ben Carson, and that vicious nut job now on the Supreme Court—Neil Gorsuch. This is a REGIME—that word matters—it is an amalgam of all the strains of fascism that have run through America’s history which have become forged over the last decades and now, in the context of the huge problems this country and system faces, has come to power. It may have shocked all or some of these fascists movements that Donald Trump is the vehicle that they are riding, but they have recognized it, and now it is so. Bannon and the Nazi Rudy Giuliani have said: THIS is our last chance (even as they have left unsaid, but made clear) to consolidate fascism. In our July 15 message, we posed: “Could it happen here? The Answer: Yes... It is an American Fascism—Manifest Destiny and American exceptionalism—a fascism wrapped in the Bible taken literally and the American flag, saturated with racism, misogyny, and xenophobia.” And, in answering yes, we said: “It is happening and the responsibility falls to all of us to stop it before it chokes off air in society.” The point is: this is not just another normal swing of the pendulum—it is a REGIME bringing about a Fascist America. ONLY REFUSE FASCISM has a PLAN for DRIVING OUT THE WHOLE REGIME, and THIS MATTERS AND IS OUR STRONG SUIT. That REFUSE FASCISM identifies and demands that the whole regime must go is a great strength and should be a magnet for people to get with the vision for November 4. Our two slogans, “This Nightmare Must End, The Trump/Pence Regime Must Go!” and “In the Name of Humanity, We REFUSE to Accept a Fascist America!” concentrate a lot of understanding of the situation that we face and the road forward—they need to be everywhere and everywhere struggled over. Our plan requires thinking and acting, as they say, outside the box. We are calling on people to put a lot on the line—taking to the streets and the public squares day after day and night after night and not stopping. For this to happen more and more people need to understand in a basic way the situation—again, the necessity—that humanity faces with fascism coming to power in the most powerful country in the world. We need to deeply get this too, because if we want others to be strong, we must be no less. The seven panels of indictments we have developed are a tremendous tool—that bring people the brutal reality of what this regime has actually done; what they have said they are going to do; and what their regime has unleashed in the states and in their vigilante fascist groups. We have not fully appreciated the role that these panels can play in mobilizing the people. After reading the panels, people have told us: “I didn’t really know.” The SCALE AND THE SCOPE of what the TRUMP/PENCE FASCIST REGIME HAS DONE IN SIX MONTHS IS BREATHTAKING. The panels have three key dimensions: Education—getting people the facts, the reality (the scale and scope of fascist remaking of society); They are a tool for politically provocative actions—wielding the panels and the research concentrated in them to hound the enemy: the regime, Congress, administrators from agencies such as ICE, the Border Patrol, and more; or, to go out and shake up and wake up those who normalize fascism and distract the people from the real deal going down and steer people away from the fact that there is an organization and a way to fight this—this includes media like CNN and MSNBC, as well as Democrats and social democrats among others; and These panels are a tremendous organizing tool. People can download the panels in different sizes and get them out in their city or neighborhood. We can’t be everywhere, but the panels can be. People want to form a group for November 4? Hold a discussion on each of the panels in light of the Refuse Fascism Call to Action and the November 4th Call, and take the display out to the people. I will come back to plans at the end of this presentation, but what overall will be decisive in bringing forward masses of people is using this sharp agitation—the exposure of what this fascist regime has done—in politically provocative actions: like the protest outside and inside Trump's recent rally in Youngstown, Ohio; the disruption and protest during the Ann Coulter Politicon panel; or the 100 hours of around-the-clock protest exposing Fox News. In the 1980s and ’90s ACT-UP did a lot of research on AIDS, and they had the goods on the government and what it was not doing to deal with AIDS. But they didn’t just sit on this information—they took creative, disruptive, even shocking actions, and that became a critical form of ACTIVE education that was, at the same time, a form of struggle. What the Trump/Pence Regime has done and is about should shock the conscience, but for all the reasons of “normalization” that I have been talking about, part of what we must do is act in ways that put the “shock the conscience” quality of this fascism in front of people where it can’t be ignored. November 4, 2017, we begin. Why have we set this date? Because without the kind of mass determined opposition of millions of people being in the streets day after day night after night, there is little chance of the whole regime being removed before they are able to cement into place a fascist re-ordering of society. By setting the date, we focus our attention and that of the whole society on the form of political protest that is required. We have recognized that there are two windows that are still open that make it possible to do what we are calling for. First is that the Trump/Pence Regime has not, as yet, been able to fully institute fascism. They have made significant progress, they have plans in the works, but there is still an opening. As we and others have pointed out, it would only take one serious international or domestic incident for that window to suddenly slam shut with the regime taking “emergency” measures. And even without such an incident, things can reach a point through executive measures and laws that the regime pushes through, where the window closes in that way—with the result that fascism is consolidated. This morning Jeff Greenfield, a long-time political commentator, was on CNN, and he argued against the prevailing discourse that Trump is “off track, not able to accomplish anything.” Greenfield said that while we, speaking of the news media and people following the media, have been caught up in the daily onslaught of outrageousness from the Trump White House, the regime has been making significant real progress in advancing their program. He pointed especially to outsourcing the appointment of federal judges to the Federalist Society, which is resulting in appointments to the federal courts of judges in the mold of Supreme Court justice Neil Gorsuch, who will radically reshape law in a reactionary direction for decades. There is a second window that we have pointed to in that there are still millions and millions of people who are not adjusted to or resigned to the Trump/Pence Regime. There is still willingness of masses of people to protest. While protests have not reached the numbers of the Women’s March, and there is a lot of normalization that has taken place, there remain millions of people who are alert. And if they saw and understood that there is a program to really remove this regime, and people acting on it, they could be moved to act. With the actions on July 15, we put on the political map that there is a national movement dedicated to fighting for the demand that the whole Trump/Pence Regime Must Go!—and that organization is Refuse Fascism. The demonstrations were relatively small, hundreds in key cities, yet people came forward in the face of threats and the presence of organized fascists. In LA, when the fascists began chanting “USA! USA!” they were answered with chants of “Humanity First! Humanity First!” We should grasp the potential and the significance of that. We should not fail to appreciate and build on the embryo of July 15. Yet we do not have the numbers or enough leaders right now for what is needed to begin on November 4. We can get them in the next two and half months. This proposal is made in full recognition of the huge leap in our work, and for the millions of people who want the nightmare to end. First, we must understand that the kind of struggle that we are calling for on November 4th is absolutely essential. Waiting till next year could well be too late. There is freedom in really understanding this. To just keep on keeping on with what we and other forces have been doing will very likely lead to real catastrophe. Understanding that hard truth opens up and compels us, together with many other people, to find and fight for the ways and means to meet that necessity that is objectively posed and underscored by setting a date to begin. The principle here is that really understanding the necessity we face opens up the potential to find and act on new freedom to transform that necessity. We should clearly understand that we are not organizing for November 4 in a situation where nothing else is happening but us and the Trump/Pence Regime. Quite the opposite. Every social force in society is in the mix in one way or another. The process of organizing and leading towards November 4 will be the back and forth, the interrelationship between what the Trump/Pence Regime does, what other fascist forces do, how the Democrats and even some Republicans conciliate with and also object to and oppose the regime, what other social forces do—the analyses they put forth and the struggles they initiate, as well as actions and events in the world from other governments, and even natural disasters (recall Katrina1); AND, all of this in relation to what Refuse Fascism puts forth and does. We will have to lead through a contentious mix of forces and events consistently putting forth our position as concentrated in the two Calls (the Call for November 4 and Refuse Fascism’s founding statement) and leading struggle as part of organizing to make a real beginning on November 4. By calling for November 4, we will actually be in a far stronger position, should masses of people come out in response to a breaking event in large numbers, to advance the date to earlier, if conditions emerge that make that possible. There is another important dimension to comprehend about why only the people through mass struggle in the ways that Refuse Fascism is calling for could lead to removing the whole regime and a positive outcome. The Democrats, along with the New York Times and the Washington Post, etc., are seeking to resolve the crisis with the Trump presidency on the terms of this system, and in the interests of the ruling class of this system, which they represent. We, the masses of people, must go all out, and mobilize ourselves in the millions, to resolve this in our interests, in the interests of humanity, which are fundamentally different from and opposed to those of the ruling class. This, of course, does not mean that the struggle among the powers-that-be is irrelevant or unimportant; rather, the way to understand and approach this (and this is a point that must also be repeatedly driven home to people, including through necessary struggle, waged well) is in terms of how it relates to, and what openings it can provide for, “the struggle from below”—for the mobilization of masses of people around the demand that the whole regime must go, because of its fascist nature and actions and what the stakes are for humanity. From my point of view, what is concentrated in these two paragraphs is extremely important and helpful to understanding the dynamics at play in the situation we face and the plan we have put forward—even as it is not necessary for people in Refuse Fascism to share this analysis of the system and its ruling class that is concentrated in these paragraphs. There are two points I want to underscore here. The first paragraph concentrates the reason why the people must take independent action outside the normal confines of two-party politics. The Democrats will not and cannot provide an answer that is in the interests of humanity to this fascism because they are part of the same system which has created the conditions that gave rise to and foster this fascism. As we saw when Trump launched missiles at Syria, the Democrats applauded, showing that when it comes to fundamental interests of their empire, they share with the fascist section of the ruling class a belligerent grotesque American chauvinism. Listen to the praises of the Democrats for the Generals John Kelly and Mad Dog Mattis. When Trump in his State of the Union address sang the praises of one of the Navy SEALs from the January raid in Yemen, CNN commentator Van Jones gushed that in that moment, Donald Trump ""became President."" Second, as the new Refuse Fascism Call for November 4 says: “The cracks and divisions among the powers already evident today will sharpen and widen. As we draw more and more people forward to stand up, all of this could lead to a situation where this illegitimate regime is removed from power.” In other words, the infighting among the rulers—between the Democrats and the Republicans, and things like the Mueller investigation—all provide openings for the struggle from below. Without that struggle from below, these cracks at the top will either amount to nothing, or will resolve in ways that could be bad for the people—such as with Pence put in power with all factions of the ruling class firmly uniting behind him and the fascist program intact. Before moving to our immediate plans, I want to underscore again that a key obstacle that we must overcome is people today having little experience with truly mass struggle that steps outside the bounds of the normal political processes, including protest as usual. Our actions and our organizing between now and then must make this different way of doing things come alive for masses of people. This is both unprecedented, and at the same time, there are models and experience to learn from. Nixon and his Vice President, Spiro Agnew were both driven from power. More recently in South Korea millions filled the streets night after night, at first starting just on the weekends, and they eventually drove their President from power. The Ukraine, Tahrir Square in Egypt—people in their millions protested day after day night after night creating a political crisis for those in power to remove despised leaders. There were shortcomings for sure, and there are differences, but never, NEVER, underestimate the power of the people when we struggle righteously in the interests of humanity. WE CAN DO THIS. The people are there. The anger is there. If we act creatively with determination, confronting the regime and their representatives and institutions and always doing so in ways that puts the truth to the lies of what they represent. Making people feel through what we do that immigrants, Muslims, women, Blacks, Latinos, LGBTQ, people all over the world are full human beings, showing through word and deed that we will not accept the cruel and brutal future of the Trump/Pence Regime ... that they must GO! And that they, and we, are the ones to make it happen. Before moving to briefly putting out the plans, I want to reiterate that while we should aim for mobilizing millions and put that before people, and if they all came out on November 4 that would be great, but the process is more likely to be, and what we must concretely achieve through our organizing, is that at least several thousand people in each of several key cities begin on November 4, and that through a process, this quickly becomes a platform from which to rapidly call forward and draw forward more and more people. There will be a back-and-forth struggle in the media, among the people, and with the authorities. Through this there will be a dynamic where through ebbs and flows as well as attempts to slander and suppress what we are doing, more and more people can be drawn forward. Where thousands become tens and then hundreds of thousands, and potentially millions. After discussion of the proposal and Call for November 4, 2017, we will discuss the upcoming Regional Conferences on August 19 and develop plans to organize and build for November 4. On November 4, 2017, we will stand together with conviction and courage, overcoming fear and uncertainty, to demand: This Nightmare Must End: The Trump/Pence Regime Must GO! This Nightmare Must End: The Trump/Pence Regime Must GO! 1. Hurricane Katrina was a major hurricane in 2005. In addition to being a devastating natural disaster, Katrina became a significant political and social crisis due to the criminal response of George W. Bush and his administration that dramatically magnified the death, the suffering, the vicious and racist repression and the widespread displacement of those hardest hit, especially larger numbers of Black people.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-terror-watch-program/,president trump has removed white supremacists from the goverment's terror watch list.,Unproven,"['cve', ' donald trump', ' president trump', ' white supremacy']",https://www.fbi.gov/,https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/domestic-threat,2017/02/02,"Domestic ThreatWhite Supremacy ExtremismIt was a gruesome and hateful crime—three men with white supremacist tattoos punching and kicking the face and body of an African-American man at a bus stop in Houston last summer simply because of the color of his skin. All three were recently convicted of the attack, following an investigation by the FBI and its partners.It’s not an isolated case. It seems like a throwback to a different era, but white supremacy—which sees whites as inherently superior to those of other races—still exists in America today. Having those kinds of beliefs is not against the law…as a matter of fact, it’s protected by the First Amendment. But white supremacy becomes a crime—and for the FBI, a form of what we call extremism—when it is furthered through threatened or actual use of force or violence or other illegal activity.The Bureau has been investigating the criminal activities of white supremacy extremists like Ku Klux Klan members since as early as 1918. Today’s extremists are more challenging than ever. They’re affiliated with a variety of white supremacy groups, and they can be motivated by any number of religious or political ideologies. We’re also seeing more lone offenders and small, violent factions of larger groups at work, which makes detection of these crimes tougher.White supremacy extremists specifically target racial, ethnic, and religious minorities; the federal government; and in some instances, even each other. Their tactics include assault, murder, threats and intimidation, and bombings. They also commit other kinds of crimes—like drug trafficking, bank and armored car robberies, and counterfeiting—to fund their hate-filled activities.Over the years, the federal government has successfully charged white supremacy extremists using a number of federal statutes, including civil rights violations, racketeering, solicitation to commit crimes of violence, firearms violations, explosives violations, counterfeiting and forgery, and witness tampering.In recent months, the FBI has led or participated in several significant investigations involving violence or attempted violence by self-admitted white supremacists. A few examples:In February 2012, an Arizona man was sentenced to federal prison after pleading guilty to possessing and transporting improvised explosive devices near the U.S.-Mexico border. DetailsIn January 2012, the last of four Arkansas defendants charged with firebombing the home of an interracial couple was sentenced to federal prison. DetailsIn December 2011, a Washington man was sentenced to 32 years in prison for attempting to bomb a Martin Luther King, Jr. Unity Day march in Spokane. DetailsIn May 2010, an Oregon man pled guilty to mailing a hangman’s noose to the home of the president of a local NAACP chapter in Ohio. DetailsMoving forward, we see three keys to turning back the ongoing scourge of white supremacy extremism:Our increased emphasis on the lawful gathering, analyzing, and sharing of intelligence on current and emerging trends, tactics, and threats.Continued collaboration with our local, state, tribal, and federal partners, especially on our Joint Terrorism Task Forces around the nation.And most importantly, the support of Americans who find these types of crimes abhorrent and antithetical to our way of life.If you have information on domestic terror threats of any kind, submit a tip or contact your local FBI field office.",2017/01/03,snopes,0

You’re not alone – plenty of us feel the need to snack as the night progresses, and luckily, studies have deduced the perfect nightcap: wine.You heard us.Recent studies have pointed out that wine can help diabetics and improve your sex drive , but apparently, wine is also a great way to prevent midnight munchies. According to Linda Monk, a 47-year-old woman who’s lost 6 pounds in three weeks, the benefit of having a nightly glass of wine is that the treat suppresses her cravings for unhealthy snacks like “sweet, biscuits, and chocolate.” Instead, the moderate portion of wine makes her feel sated without going to town on the late night eating. Linda is gleaning advice from Tim Ferriss’s book: The 4-Hour Body: An Uncommon Guide To Rapid Weight Loss . Ferriss champions the theory that if you enjoy a little wine in the evening, you’re more likely to feel satisfied and thus less inclined to give up on dieting. Red wine is supposedly preferable to other snacks.According to The Daily Mail, a study that took place over the course of 13 years at Harvard University found that amongst a group of 20,000 women, those who drank half a bottle of wine a day lessened their risk of obesity. As half a bottle is the equivalent of two glasses, Linda and the other women seem to be live proof of the study.40-year-old Samantha Merrit is another woman who sings the praises of nightly wine, claiming “the calories don’t seem to have made an impact on the bathroom scales…Now, I can happily say no to a dessert and I treat myself to a glass or two around four nights a week.” Besides her appetite being satisfied, Merrit also credits the wine with helping her sleep and feeling less anxious.As is always the case, the trick is moderation. While having a glass or two before bed is a good substitute for going crazy on chocolate snacking, drinking too much wine can leave you consuming more calories than a late night binge, and leave you feeling pretty hungover for work. Stick to 1-2 glasses if you want to curb your hunger, sleep better, and feel less deprived.",2015/05/12,snopes,1

""the way"") is Islamic law covering conduct in all aspects of life, though nowadays it is primarily applied in commercial and personal relationships. There are multiple schools of sharia jurisprudence, each of course claiming to be the correct understanding. Sharia is not codified, and is best thought instead as a way to enforce laws based on the teachings of the Qur'an and hadiths. Sharia is commonly and incorrectly labeled ""sharia law"" when it should simply be written as sharia. It is roughly analogous to halakha in Judaism. Many Muslims consider it a good idea for moral guidance. But in some countries under sharia, Mutaween (religious police) enforce the practice of the law. When assessing sharia, however, it is important to remember that it is not a single thing. Every country that implements some form of ""sharia"" does so differently, in terms of the strictness of the laws, the specifics of the laws, and whether or not the laws apply to non-Muslims. Contents1 Religious law1.1 Wahhabi-Salafist2 Cairo Declaration on Human Rights3 Implementation3.1 Creeping sharia in America3.2 Sharia in Britain3.3 Sharia in Canada4 See also5 External links6 ReferencesReligious law[edit]Unlike secular laws, sharia is based on religious teachings, and is seen by traditionalists as a reflection of God’s will. The precepts of sharia reach beyond criminal law and provide conventions for many other aspects of life, such as diet, clothing and regulated prayer. Women are expected to be obedient, husbands may beat their wives even for suspected but unproved arrogance, but those who disagree with this can argue that ""the best example was the Messenger himself [Mohammed] never beating a woman."" On top of that, there's a strong case to be made that ""sharia"" can and should be considered primarily a guide to personal morality, with its prescriptions for social laws being subject to override by civil authorities if it's in the public interest — and there's also a decent case that it's not. In other words, the sharia is a mess — nobody's really sure what it's supposed to be (some people say they're sure, but we call these people extremists when we're being polite) or how it's supposed to be applied. It makes the Jewish arguments over the Talmud and Halakha look small by comparison. There are at least five main interpretations of sharia. They are largely based on common precepts, but are by no means identical:Hanafi (Sunni. Generally predominant in Central Asia.)Hanbali (Sunni. Generally predominant in Saudi Arabia.)Jaafari (Shia. Generally predominant in Iran.)Maliki (Sunni. Generally predominant in Northern Africa.)Shafi‘i (Sunni. Generally predominant in Indonesia, Brunei, Sudan, Ethiopia and Somalia.)Other Muslim scholars interpret the Qu'ran in very much more moderate ways than the extremists. Wahhabi-Salafist[edit]The Hanbali school is the forerunner of the modern Wahhabi-Salafist school dominant in the Islamic State. It views the Qur'an and Hadith as true and correct and not open to interpretation. Logic and reasoning are believed to open the way to human desire, distortion, and deviancy. Human desire will compromise human interests with religious truth. Quentin Wotorowitz describes how Salafis arrive at legal judgments that affect all aspects of contemporary society, culture, and governance:Salafis like to approach the process of applying religious principles to contemporary issues and problems as though it is a scientific enterprise governed by the hard laws of nature (in this case divinity). The Salafi creed outlines the rules for generating religious opinions to ensure that conclusions are methodologically sound and based on solid evidence from the Qur’an, Sunna, and consensus of the companions. This creed, Salafis assume, eliminates (or at least limits) the potential of human bias and error by structuring the process of deduction and the criteria for acceptable findings according to the Prophetic model. In a way, it is a positivistic approach that eschews normative ambiguity, relativism, and the possibility of multiple truths. If one follows the method and procedures of the Salafi creed, the expectation is that religious rulings represent the unadulterated and singular truth of God’s will because they rely on the original and pure sources of Islam. In this endeavor, Salafis frequently exhibit the arrogance of scientific certitude. Because there is only one straight path and saved sect, the Salafi creed and method are seen as inexorably producing the ""correct"" Islamic understanding. Conclusions are represented as the teleology of a process rooted solely in the sources of Islam. It is as though Muslims posit questions to a computer run by divine software. Ipso facto, all alternative conclusions are misguidance and reflect the interjection of human reasoning or a lack of religious training and knowledge, the glitches of inferior programming. In these circumstances, well-trained scholars are truly doing God’s work: they merely take contemporary questions and follow methodological rules set out by God. Cairo Declaration on Human Rights[edit]In 1990, Muslim majority nations criticized the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights for being a secularized version of Judeo-Christian principles. They released a ""sharia-compatible"" version of the declaration called the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights. It's rather ambiguous on a number of rights. Article 1 states:“”All human beings form one family whose members are united by their subordination to Allah and descent from Adam. All men are equal in terms of basic human dignity and basic obligations and responsibilities, without any discrimination on the basis of race, colour, language, belief, sex, religion, political affiliation, social status or other considerations. The true religion is the guarantee for enhancing such dignity along the path to human integrity. While Article 10 states:“”Islam is the religion of true unspoiled nature. It is prohibited to exercise any form of pressure on man or to exploit his poverty or ignorance in order to force him to change his religion to another religion or to atheism. The International Humanist and Ethical Union has criticized the Declaration for limiting freedom of religion and freedom of speech.Blasphemy, for example, is still punishable by death in some areas in the Middle East. Similarly, apostasy is punishable by death in some countries, including Iran and Saudi Arabia. The most infamous incident relating to this is probably Ayatollah Khomeini's call for the execution of Salman Rushdie. Implementation[edit] Haziq-Ul-Khairi, Chief Justice of the Federal Shariat Court of PakistanThe implementation of sharia varies across the globe. Saudi Arabia bases its legal system heavily on its interpretations of sharia, and it has given sharia courts complete authority over jurisprudence. However, this is an uncommon feature, and many Muslim states use dual systems of secular and religious courts, or only implement the sections of sharia that address financial and marital issues. Iran's government adheres to the Shi'a school of Islam, and they view sharia as a Sunni phenomenon. In practice, their laws are generally similar, although, in some areas, human rights are actually better in Iran when compared to Saudi Arabia. For example, women are generally required to wear niqabs or burqas and only a certain brand of Islam is allowed in Saudi Arabia, whereas in Iran women must wear a headscarf (that is, the face may be uncovered, unlike in Saudi Arabia in general) and most religious minorities are semi-protected. Corporal and capital punishments are common under the stricter interpretations of sharia, and much of the judgments are incomprehensible to Westerners. In November 2007 a multiple rape victim in Saudi Arabia was sentenced to 200 lashes for initially being alone with a man who was not a relative. The victim's lawyer was suspended from the case as a result of the appeal and his license has been revoked.Saudi interpretation of sharia has been strongly influenced by the dominant Wahhabist movement, so some claim such cases cannot be seen as representative of Islam as such. Hence the significant outcry from ""mainstream"" Muslims about it, almost as loud as Christian denunciations of fundamentalists. Oh, wait. On 1 May 2014, Brunei became the first Southeast Asian state to introduce strict sharia, which applies to both Muslims and non-Muslims. Creeping sharia in America[edit]“”i often disagree with DigimonOtis, but his efforts to keep Sharia Law out of the donkey kong 64 wiki are much needed in this wolrd of danger —wint Anti-sharia billboard in the US in 2008""Creeping sharia"" is a fairly recent wingnut conspiracy theory peddled by the likes of Pamela Geller that asserts Muslims are implementing sharia in American court systems. Alternatively, it's a reaction to what has happened in other nations. This fear has been stoked by comments from politicians such as Sharron Angle and Newt Gingrich and manifested in the Park51 and Halal soup incidents, as well as legislation passed in Oklahoma banning the use of sharia in state courts and efforts to prevent the opening of a mosque in Murfreesboro, Tennessee.Frank Gaffney has also touted ""research"" that supposedly ""proves"" the Muslims are taking over the judicial system.Ironically, many of the people raising the alarm about sharia share the homophobic, misogynist, religiously intolerant attitudes of extremist groups which do not agree with actual modern sharia practiced by nonviolent Muslims. References to the Qur'an in US judicial rulings are in fact rare, whereas references to the Bible are widespread. Sharia in Britain[edit] Protest against sharia in the United Kingdom in 2014In Britain Sharia is implemented by Muslim Arbitration Tribunals, which were introduced in 2007, and sharia councils, around since 1982. These courts deal exclusively in civil law, and only in cases where both parties consent to the use of sharia; however, critics point to incidents in which those who do not consent to the use of sharia are illegally coerced into cooperating: by threat, intimidation, or the ostracization of being a ""kafir"". In 2014, the Law Society issued a practice note which instructed lawyers on how to prepare Sharia-compliant wills. This note was strongly opposed by the Lawyers' Secular Society and was later withdrawn. In January 2013, there were incidents described in the media as ""Muslim Patrols"" where some vigilantes arbitrarily imposed sharia, including on non-Muslims, by confronting gays, women in miniskirts and alcohol drinkers. These incidents are not recognized by the UK government as anything other than the acts of criminal gangs. Nonetheless, Islamophobes frequently cite these as somehow connected to the legal arbitration courts.[citation needed]During recent years, sharia councils have been used increasingly in the UK and there are claims some of them act unfairly to women, including legitimizing forced marriages and issuing discriminatory divorces to women. There are claims that some women were victims of inequitable decisions. Then-Home Secretary, Theresa May, claimed there is only one rule of law in the UK, stating that there would be a review of whether sharia discriminates against women, and also ""whether, and to what extent, the application of Sharia law may be incompatible with the law in England and Wales"". There are serious concerns about the inclusion of theologians and fundamentalists in the review and there are grave doubts over its impartiality. “”We had hoped and understood that the inquiry into these alarming developments – that are conveniently ignored by some civil rights campaigners who decry state but not fundamentalist abuse of power – would be truly independent. However, we are now dismayed to learn that far from examining the key connections between religious fundamentalism and women's rights, the narrow remit of the inquiry will render it a whitewash; and instead of human rights experts and campaigners, it is to be chaired and advised by theologians. The danger is that the inquiry is setting out with a pre-determined objective that will approve the expansion of the role of Sharia and religious arbitration forums and their jurisdiction over family matters in minority communities, albeit with a little tweaking to make it more palatable to the state. —Open letter to Theresa May The majority of UK Muslim marriages do not include a civil marriage recognised in UK law, leaving women unable to get what should be their legal right if the marriage breaks down.Sharia in Canada[edit]In 2005, a Canadian committee headed by former Attorney General Marion Boyd recommended allowing Muslims in the province of Ontario to establish sharia-based civil law tribunals (similar to religiously-based tribunals already in use by the province's Catholics and Jews). After a strong public outcry, Liberal Premier Dalton McGuinty vetoed the plan, and moved to prohibit religious tribunals of any kind.

When assessing sharia, however, it is important to remember that it is not a single thing. Every country that implements some form of ""sharia"" does so differently, in terms of the strictness of the laws, the specifics of the laws, and whether or not the laws apply to non-Muslims. Unlike secular laws, sharia is based on religious teachings, and is seen by traditionalists as a reflection of God’s will. The precepts of sharia reach beyond criminal law and provide conventions for many other aspects of life, such as diet, clothing and regulated prayer. Women are expected to be obedient, husbands may beat their wives even for suspected but unproved arrogance, but those who disagree with this can argue that ""the best example was the Messenger himself [Mohammed] never beating a woman."" On top of that, there's a strong case to be made that ""sharia"" can and should be considered primarily a guide to personal morality, with its prescriptions for social laws being subject to override by civil authorities if it's in the public interest — and there's also a decent case that it's not. In other words, the sharia is a mess — nobody's really sure what it's supposed to be (some people say they're sure, but we call these people extremists when we're being polite) or how it's supposed to be applied. It makes the Jewish arguments over the Talmud and Halakha look small by comparison. There are at least five main interpretations of sharia. Hanafi (Sunni. Hanbali (Sunni. Jaafari (Shia. Maliki (Sunni. Shafi‘i (Sunni. Other Muslim scholars interpret the Qu'ran in very much more moderate ways than the extremists. The Hanbali school is the forerunner of the modern Wahhabi-Salafist school dominant in the Islamic State. It views the Qur'an and Hadith as true and correct and not open to interpretation. Logic and reasoning are believed to open the way to human desire, distortion, and deviancy. Human desire will compromise human interests with religious truth. Salafis like to approach the process of applying religious principles to contemporary issues and problems as though it is a scientific enterprise governed by the hard laws of nature (in this case divinity). The Salafi creed outlines the rules for generating religious opinions to ensure that conclusions are methodologically sound and based on solid evidence from the Qur’an, Sunna, and consensus of the companions. This creed, Salafis assume, eliminates (or at least limits) the potential of human bias and error by structuring the process of deduction and the criteria for acceptable findings according to the Prophetic model. In a way, it is a positivistic approach that eschews normative ambiguity, relativism, and the possibility of multiple truths. If one follows the method and procedures of the Salafi creed, the expectation is that religious rulings represent the unadulterated and singular truth of God’s will because they rely on the original and pure sources of Islam. In this endeavor, Salafis frequently exhibit the arrogance of scientific certitude. Because there is only one straight path and saved sect, the Salafi creed and method are seen as inexorably producing the ""correct"" Islamic understanding. Conclusions are represented as the teleology of a process rooted solely in the sources of Islam. It is as though Muslims posit questions to a computer run by divine software. Ipso facto, all alternative conclusions are misguidance and reflect the interjection of human reasoning or a lack of religious training and knowledge, the glitches of inferior programming. In these circumstances, well-trained scholars are truly doing God’s work: they merely take contemporary questions and follow methodological rules set out by God. In 1990, Muslim majority nations criticized the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights for being a secularized version of Judeo-Christian principles. They released a ""sharia-compatible"" version of the declaration called the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights. It's rather ambiguous on a number of rights. “”All human beings form one family whose members are united by their subordination to Allah and descent from Adam. All men are equal in terms of basic human dignity and basic obligations and responsibilities, without any discrimination on the basis of race, colour, language, belief, sex, religion, political affiliation, social status or other considerations. The true religion is the guarantee for enhancing such dignity along the path to human integrity. “”Islam is the religion of true unspoiled nature. It is prohibited to exercise any form of pressure on man or to exploit his poverty or ignorance in order to force him to change his religion to another religion or to atheism. The International Humanist and Ethical Union has criticized the Declaration for limiting freedom of religion and freedom of speech.Blasphemy, for example, is still punishable by death in some areas in the Middle East. Similarly, apostasy is punishable by death in some countries, including Iran and Saudi Arabia. The most infamous incident relating to this is probably Ayatollah Khomeini's call for the execution of Salman Rushdie. The implementation of sharia varies across the globe. Saudi Arabia bases its legal system heavily on its interpretations of sharia, and it has given sharia courts complete authority over jurisprudence. However, this is an uncommon feature, and many Muslim states use dual systems of secular and religious courts, or only implement the sections of sharia that address financial and marital issues. Iran's government adheres to the Shi'a school of Islam, and they view sharia as a Sunni phenomenon. In practice, their laws are generally similar, although, in some areas, human rights are actually better in Iran when compared to Saudi Arabia. For example, women are generally required to wear niqabs or burqas and only a certain brand of Islam is allowed in Saudi Arabia, whereas in Iran women must wear a headscarf (that is, the face may be uncovered, unlike in Saudi Arabia in general) and most religious minorities are semi-protected. Corporal and capital punishments are common under the stricter interpretations of sharia, and much of the judgments are incomprehensible to Westerners. In November 2007 a multiple rape victim in Saudi Arabia was sentenced to 200 lashes for initially being alone with a man who was not a relative. The victim's lawyer was suspended from the case as a result of the appeal and his license has been revoked. Saudi interpretation of sharia has been strongly influenced by the dominant Wahhabist movement, so some claim such cases cannot be seen as representative of Islam as such. Hence the significant outcry from ""mainstream"" Muslims about it, almost as loud as Christian denunciations of fundamentalists. Oh, wait. On 1 May 2014, Brunei became the first Southeast Asian state to introduce strict sharia, which applies to both Muslims and non-Muslims. ""Creeping sharia"" is a fairly recent wingnut conspiracy theory peddled by the likes of Pamela Geller that asserts Muslims are implementing sharia in American court systems. Alternatively, it's a reaction to what has happened in other nations. This fear has been stoked by comments from politicians such as Sharron Angle and Newt Gingrich and manifested in the Park51 and Halal soup incidents, as well as legislation passed in Oklahoma banning the use of sharia in state courts and efforts to prevent the opening of a mosque in Murfreesboro, Tennessee.Frank Gaffney has also touted ""research"" that supposedly ""proves"" the Muslims are taking over the judicial system.Ironically, many of the people raising the alarm about sharia share the homophobic, misogynist, religiously intolerant attitudes of extremist groups which do not agree with actual modern sharia practiced by nonviolent Muslims. References to the Qur'an in US judicial rulings are in fact rare, whereas references to the Bible are widespread. In Britain Sharia is implemented by Muslim Arbitration Tribunals, which were introduced in 2007, and sharia councils, around since 1982. These courts deal exclusively in civil law, and only in cases where both parties consent to the use of sharia; however, critics point to incidents in which those who do not consent to the use of sharia are illegally coerced into cooperating: by threat, intimidation, or the ostracization of being a ""kafir"". In 2014, the Law Society issued a practice note which instructed lawyers on how to prepare Sharia-compliant wills. This note was strongly opposed by the Lawyers' Secular Society and was later withdrawn. In January 2013, there were incidents described in the media as ""Muslim Patrols"" where some vigilantes arbitrarily imposed sharia, including on non-Muslims, by confronting gays, women in miniskirts and alcohol drinkers. These incidents are not recognized by the UK government as anything other than the acts of criminal gangs. During recent years, sharia councils have been used increasingly in the UK and there are claims some of them act unfairly to women, including legitimizing forced marriages and issuing discriminatory divorces to women. There are claims that some women were victims of inequitable decisions. Then-Home Secretary, Theresa May, claimed there is only one rule of law in the UK, stating that there would be a review of whether sharia discriminates against women, and also ""whether, and to what extent, the application of Sharia law may be incompatible with the law in England and Wales"". There are serious concerns about the inclusion of theologians and fundamentalists in the review and there are grave doubts over its impartiality. “”We had hoped and understood that the inquiry into these alarming developments – that are conveniently ignored by some civil rights campaigners who decry state but not fundamentalist abuse of power – would be truly independent. However, we are now dismayed to learn that far from examining the key connections between religious fundamentalism and women's rights, the narrow remit of the inquiry will render it a whitewash; and instead of human rights experts and campaigners, it is to be chaired and advised by theologians. The danger is that the inquiry is setting out with a pre-determined objective that will approve the expansion of the role of Sharia and religious arbitration forums and their jurisdiction over family matters in minority communities, albeit with a little tweaking to make it more palatable to the state. In 2005, a Canadian committee headed by former Attorney General Marion Boyd recommended allowing Muslims in the province of Ontario to establish sharia-based civil law tribunals (similar to religiously-based tribunals already in use by the province's Catholics and Jews). After a strong public outcry, Liberal Premier Dalton McGuinty vetoed the plan, and moved to prohibit religious tribunals of any kind.

Because of this, we have never removed a star from the Walk.""As tourists around the world flock to Hollywood Blvd and the surrounding streets, there is no doubt that the Hollywood Walk of Fame is an iconic marker of the entertainment industry around the globe. Getting a star on the Walk of Fame, for many, is a top career achievement, deserving recognition of a significant contribution to the most glamorous of professions.However, at what point does an entertainer's tarnished legacy outweigh his or her contributions? With scandal so ingrained in the fabric of Tinseltown —and with more than 2,500 stars on the Walk of Fame — there are bound to be more than a few scandalous honorees lining the streets of Hollywood.THR rounded up some of the more controversial Walk of Fame stars below:1) Bill CosbyThough whispers and rumors surrounding Bill Cosby’s interactions with women have been around for decades, it wasn’t until comedian Hannibal Buress called the former sitcom star “a rapist,” that the full scope of Cosby’s wrongdoings was revealed. More than 40 women have accused the former epitome of morally upstanding fatherhood of drugging them and sexually assaulting them. Cosby himself, as it was recently revealed, said in a 2005 deposition that he purchased drugs to give to women for the purposes of sex.Cosby's star has been defaced multiple times with the word ""rapist.""Walk of Fame Says Bill Cosby's Star Isn't Going Anywhere http://t.co/12KUer3lrX pic.twitter.com/mW3HGOlx0d— LAist (@LAist) July 9, 20152) Donald TrumpEchoing the calls for the removal of Cosby’s star, Latino advocacy groups have called for the removal of Donald Trump’s star as well. The magnate and one of many GOP candidates for president has come under fire as of late for his comments on immigration , in which he called Mexican immigrants “cartel members” and “rapists."" The comments have caused Macy’s, NBC and numerous others to sever their partnerships with the businessman.3) Roscoe “Fatty” ArbuckleThe silent film star and comedian was responsible for discovering Bob Hope and Buster Keaton, among others, and helped mentor Charlie Chaplin, but in 1921, he was accused of brutally raping and killing actress Virginia Rappe. After three trials — two of which were mistrials due to a hung jury— Arbuckle was eventually acquitted of the charges. The scandal hung over the star for the rest of his career, as he was ostracized and blackballed from (though eventually reinstated to) the industry.4) Gig YoungYoung, an Academy Award winner for his role as a dance-marathon emcee in 1969’s They Shoot Horses, Don’t They? is perhaps more infamously known for killing his wife and then himself in a murder-suicide in 1978, after years struggling with alcoholism.5) Randy QuaidBrother to fellow actor and Walk of Fame honoree Dennis Quaid, Randy Quaid, who was nominated for an Oscar in 1973 for The Last Detail, has increasingly become known for his ramblings about America, as well as his mounting legal troubles. He and wife Evi were being held in a Canadian immigration jail after asking for refugee status to escape “starwhackers” — killers believed to target the famous — that they would encounter in the U.S.6) Charlie SheenStill #winning? Sheen, infamous for his struggles with drugs and domestic abuse, hit a low point in 2011 after he was ousted from his CBS sitcom, Two and a Half Men, and went on multiple extreme and bizarre rants against creator Chuck Lorre (the words ""warlock"" and ""tiger blood"" come to mind). The actor has continued with the odd behavior in the years following, never straying too far from scandal.7) John Drew BarrymoreThe Barrymores are the most honored clan on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, but John Drew Barrymore, Drew Barrymore’s father, is perhaps the black sheep of the family. Having some success on TV, the actor struggled with alcohol and drugs and was charged with domestic abuse, causing estrangement between daughter Drew and himself.8) Michael JacksonControversy surrounded the pop star throughout his career, from dangling his son Blanket over a railing to peculiar tastes and child friendships with stars like Macaulay Culkin. In 2005, Jackson stood trial on child molestation charges, and although he was eventually acquitted, the charges have colored the king of pop’s legacy.9) Don CorneliusThe creator of Soul Train was arrested in 2008 on a felony domestic violence charge for spousal abuse against his estranged wife. Though he originally pleaded not guilty, he changed his plea to no contest and received 3 years probation. Cornelius committed suicide in 2012 . According to former Soul Train host Shemar Moore, Cornelius may have been suffering from early onset of dementia or Alzheimer's disease and his health had been on the decline.",2015/07/10,snopes,0

The protagonist is Cornelis Vlasman, a versatile biologist for whom the path well-travelled is the most uninteresting one by definition. Together with a few like-minded people he therefore starts an independent laboratory in which he experiments with organic materials, on his own initiative, with his own resources and his own team.After many years of hard work, Vlasman’s team succeeds in creating new life from cells taken from his own body. Under his supervision the world’s first living organism is built: OSCAR.OSCAR is a prototype (the size of a human hand) consisting of clickable organ modules grown from human cells.What makes OSCAR special is the thought process preceding the organism, which comes down to this: (human) life can be regarded as a closed system but when it is approached as a modular system this may lead to innovative applications and solutions.In a closed system the parts are designed in such a way that they can only function in one specific configuration, which makes repairs and adaptations very complex. An example of such a closed system is the first Apple Macintosh from 1988.In a modular system, independent modules – similar to building blocks – make up a transformable and therefore flexible configuration. In 2013, Dave Hakkens produced a Modular Phone that consists of separate parts that can be individually replaced and improved.With the organism OSCAR Vlasman demonstrates that it is possible to create modular life. Stem cells can be reprogrammed, grown and printed as any type of human tissue. The line separating humans from machines is gradually becoming thinner.The OSCAR prototype opens up possibilities for the human body, for example when it comes to replacing or improving worn out organs in a possibly ‘clickable’ system. Think of Lego as a metaphor.In biotechnology many experiments are conducted nowadays with printed organs, regenerated tissue and synthetic blood. Organovo, one of the world’s largest biotech companies, expects to be able to print a functional liver by 2014. Taking the entire human body as a possibly modular system is not (or not yet) possible.Vlasman develops the OSCAR organism – made up from ‘blocks’ – in his lab. This independent and somewhat obscure laboratory is run by a group of people with various expertise: IT specialists, biologists and designers, working with handmade and sometimes second-hand equipment. They operate outside of official channels, thereby avoiding moratoria, scientific protocols or objections of ethical committees, which perhaps enables them to arrive at this seminal breakthrough.The primitive, vulnerable organism that finally results from Vlasman’s endeavours is kept alive with blood taken from Vlasman and is continually vaccinated against infections, as it has no immune system. The story refers to various similar narratives in world literature and film history, notably Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein.Contact",2016/04/09,snopes,0

The god of the flooding of the Nile, symbol of abundance and fertility, has never before been discovered at such a large scale, which points to his importance for the Canopic region.Photographer: Christoph GerigkCopyright: Franck Goddio/Hilti FoundationThis is a story that certainly pricked my interest this morning. It involves the discovery of Heracleion (as named by the Greeks but named Thonis by the ancient Egyptians) which disappeared into the sea around 1200 years ago!Until a decade ago, no one knew if Heracleion, believed to be an ancient harbor city, was fiction or real. Now the researchers who found it—150 feet beneath the surface of Egypt’s Bay of Aboukir—are sharing some of the amazing historical artifacts preserved there.The finds include 64 ships, 16-foot-tall statues, 700 anchors and countless gold coins and smaller artifacts.According to underwater archeologist Franck Goddio, credited with having discovered the site, the city was probably built sometime around the 8th century B.C., which makes it older than the famed city of Alexandria. Over the years, it fell victim to a number of natural disasters before being swallowed by the sea, probably around A.D. 700.“We are just at the beginning of our research,” said Goddio. “We will probably have to continue working for the next 200 years for [it]to be fully revealed and understood.”It’s believed that gradual soil erosion eventually caused Heracleion to fall into the Mediterranean. “It is now clear that a slow movement of subsidence of the soil affected this part of the south-eastern basin of the Mediterranean,” Goddio writes on his site. “The rise in sea level—already observed in antiquity—also contributed significantly to the submergence of the land.”Researchers are beginning to more fully understand what daily life was like in the city, also called “Thonis.” Mainly, they describe it as having served as the main hub for sea traffic entering the region, including all trade from Greece.“We are getting a rich picture of things like the trade that was going on there and the nature of the maritime economy in the Egyptian late period,” Damian Robinson, director of the Oxford Centre for Maritime Archaeology at the University of Oxford, told the Telegraph. Robinson is part of the team that has been busy uncovering artifacts from Heracleion’s sunken remains.“It was the major international trading port for Egypt at this time,” Robinson added. “It is where taxation was taken on import and export duties. All of this was run by the main temple.”The city is also believed to have had a rich cultural history. Helen was said to have visited it with her lover Paris shortly before the onset of the Trojan War.Among the most important monuments that were discovered at the temple area of Thonis-Heracleion is this monolithic chapel (naos) dating to the Ptolemaic period. It served as a key for the identification of the city.Photographer: Christoph GerigkCopyright: Franck Goddio/Hilti FoundationFranck Goddio and divers of his team are inspecting the statue of a pharaoh.

In its practical implementation, the core challenge is to reduce this grand vision into bite-sized pieces of research. In the search for organic remnants of past life, it is enormously helpful to have a paradigm to guide exploration. This begins with assessing habitability: Was the former environment supportive of life? If so, was it also conducive to preservation of organism remains, specifically large organic molecules?The 2004 arrival of the Mars Exploration Rovers (MERs) Spirit and Opportunity provided a chance to investigate ancient aqueous environments in situ and deduce their likelihood of supporting life. Initial results confirmed what data from orbiters had long suggested—that diverse aqueous environments existed on the surface of Mars billions of years ago. The success of the MERs led to the development of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission. The Curiosity rover landed at Gale crater in 2012 and was designed to specifically test whether ancient aqueous environments had also been habitable. In addition to water, did these ancient environments also record evidence for the chemical building blocks of life (C, H, N, O, P, S), as well as chemical and/or mineralogic evidence for redox gradients that would have enabled microbial metabolism, such as chemoautotrophy? Curiosity also has the capability to detect organic carbon, but it is not equipped for life detection.Open in new tabImage taken by the Mars Hand Lens Imager of the John Klein drill hole (1.6 cm in diameter) at Yellowknife Bay reveals gray cuttings of mudstone (ancient lake sediments), rock powder, and interior wall.An array of eight ChemCam laser shot points can be seen. The gray color suggests that reduced, rather than oxidized, chemical compounds and minerals dominated the pore fluid chemistry of the ancient sediment. A cross-cutting network of sulfate-filled fractures indicates later flow of groundwater through fractures after the sediment was lithified.CREDIT: NASA/JPL-CALTECH/MALIN SPACE SCIENCE SYSTEMSFive articles presented in full in the online edition of Science ( www.sciencemag.org/extra/curiosity ), with abstracts in print, describe the detection at Gale crater of a system of ancient environments (including streams, lakes, and groundwater networks) that would have been habitable by chemoautotrophic microorganisms. The Hesperian age (<∼3.7 billion years) rocks mentioned in these articles are at the young end of the spectrum of ancient martian aqueous environments. Yet, a sixth article details a more ancient and also potentially habitable environment detected in Noachian age (>∼3.7 billion years) rocks at Meridiani Planum. A seventh article describes the present radiation environment on the surface of Mars at Gale crater and its influence on the preservation of organic compounds in rocks.Opportunity landed at Meridiani Planum on 25 January 2004. Coincident with the 10th anniversary of this landing, Arvidson et al. report the detection of an ancient clay-forming, subsurface aqueous environment at Endeavour crater, Meridiani Planum. Though Opportunity does not have the ability to directly detect C or N, it has been able to establish that several of the other key factors that allow for the identification of a formerly habitable environment were in place. This potentially habitable environment stratigraphically underlies and is considerably older than the rocks detected earlier in the mission that represent acidic, hypersaline environments that would have challenged even the hardiest extremophiles. The presence of both Fe+3- and Al-rich smectite clay minerals in rocks on the rim of the Noachian age Endeavour impact crater were inferred from the joint use of hyperspectral observations by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and extensive surface observations by the Opportunity rover. The rover was guided tactically by orbiter-based mapping. Extensive leaching and formation of Al-rich smectites occurred in subsurface groundwater fracture systems.Grotzinger et al. show that an ancient habitable environment existed at Yellowknife Bay, Gale crater, where stream waters flowed from the crater rim and pooled in a curvilinear depression at the base of Gale's central mountain to form a lake-streamgroundwater system that might have existed for millions of years. Vaniman et al. provide evidence for moderate to neutral pH, as shown by the presence of smectite clay minerals and the absence of acid-environment sulfate minerals, and show that the environment had variable redox states due to the presence of mixed-valence Fe (magnetite) and S (sulfide, sulfate) minerals formed within the sediment and cementing rock. McLennan et al. show that lake salinities were low because of the very low concentration of salt in the lake deposits. Elemental data indicate that clays were formed in the lake environment and that minimal weathering of the crater rim occurred, suggesting that a colder and/or drier climate was prevalent.Ming et al. show that the thermal decomposition of rock powder yielded NO and CO2, indicating the presence of nitrogen- and carbon-bearing materials. CO2 may have been generated by either carbonate or organic materials. Concurrent evolution of O2 and chlorinated hydrocarbons indicates the presence of oxychlorine species. Higher abundances of chlorinated hydrocarbons in the lake mudstones, as compared with modern windblown materials, suggest that indigenous martian or meteoritic organic C sources are preserved in the mudstone. However, the possibility of terrestrial background sources brought by the rover itself cannot be excluded.These results demonstrate that early Mars was habitable, but this does not mean that Mars was inhabited. Even for Earth, it was a formidable challenge to prove that microbial life existed billions of years ago—a discovery that occurred almost 100 years after Darwin predicted it, through the recognition of microfossils preserved in silica ( 1 ). The trick was finding a material that could preserve cellular structures. A future mission could do the same for Mars if life had existed there. Curiosity can help now by aiding our understanding of how organic compounds are preserved in rocks, which, in turn, could provide guidance to narrow down where and how to find materials that could preserve fossils as well. However, it is not obvious that much organic matter, of either abiologic or biologic origin, might survive degradational rock-forming and environmental processes. Our expectations are conditioned by our understanding of Earth's earliest record of life, which is very sparse.Paleontology embraces this challenge of record failure with the subdiscipline of taphonomy, through which we seek to understand the preservation process of materials of potential biologic interest. On Mars, a first step would involve detection of complex organic molecules of either abiotic or biotic origin; the point is that organic molecules are reduced and the planet is generally regarded as oxidizing, and so their preservation requires special conditions. For success, several processes must be optimized. Primary enrichment of organics must first occur, and their destruction should be minimized during the conversion of sediment to rock and by limiting exposure of sampled rocks to ionizing radiation. Of these conditions, the third is the least Earth-like (Earth's thick atmosphere and magnetic field greatly reduce incoming radiation). Curiosity can directly measure both the modern dose of ionizing cosmic radiation and the accumulated dose for the interval of time that ancient rocks have been exposed at the surface of Mars.Hassler et al. quantify the present-day radiation environment on Mars that affects how any organic molecules that might be present in ancient rocks may degrade in the shallow surface (that is, the top few meters). This shallow zone is penetrated by radiation, creating a cascade of atomic and subatomic particles that ionize molecules and atoms in their path. Their measurements over the first year of Curiosity's operations provide an instantaneous sample of radiation dose rates affecting rocks, as well as future astronauts. Extrapolating these rates over geologically important periods of time and merging with modeled radiolysis data yields a predicted 1000-fold decrease in 100–atomic mass unit organic molecules in ∼650 million years.Sediments that were buried and lithified beneath the radiation penetration depth, possibly with organic molecules, would eventually be exhumed by erosion and exposed at the surface. During exhumation, organics would become subject to radiation damage as they entered the upper few meters below the rock-atmosphere interface. The time scale of erosion and exhumation, and thus the duration that any parcel of rock is subjected to ionizing radiation, can be determined by measuring cosmogenically produced noble gas isotopes that accumulate in the rock. 36Ar is produced by the capture of cosmogenic neutrons by Cl, whereas 3He and 21Ne are produced by spallation reactions on the major rock-forming elements. Farley et al. show that the sampled rocks were exposed on the order of ∼80 million years ago, suggesting that preservation of any organics that accumulated in the primary environment was possible, although the signal might have been substantially reduced.Wind-induced saltation abrasion of the rocks in Yellowknife Bay appears to have been the mechanism responsible for erosion and exhumation of the ancient lake bed sampled by Curiosity. The geomorphic expression of this process is a series of rocky scarps that retreated in the downwind direction. Understanding this process leads to the prediction that rocks closest to the scarps were most recently exhumed and are thus most likely to preserve organics, all other factors being equal. In this manner, the MSL mission has evolved from initially seeking to understand the habitability of ancient Mars to developing predictive models for the taphonomy of martian organic matter. This parallels the previous decade, in which the MER mission turned the corner from a mission dedicated to detecting ancient aqueous environments to one devoted to understanding how to search for that subset of aqueous environments that may also have been habitable.ReferencesS.

They learn to ram other vehicles without causing injury, stop or turn their cars while driving at high speeds, and drive in reverse at 50 mph.They are taught to use their vehicles-from police-packaged sedans and SUVs to an armored Humvee-as weapons, important tools to keep their protectees safe.The school also purchases 'clunkers' students can use to practice ramming and moving other cars. Airbags are removed and students wear helmets and padding for safety, while an instructor rides shotgun, ready to grab the wheel at any time.'Each student will have a car that they hit another car with and ram them out of the way, in front and back (going straight and in reverse),' said Rodney Larson, lead instructor for the Anti-terrorism Evasive Driving Course. 'If you get the technique, you can get them out of the way before you drive straight through them. You're using your car and your engine as a weapon, versus stopping and trying to get out and have a gunfight. You're mobile so you stay mobile.'The cars lose headlights, bumpers and other pieces as the training progresses, and according to C. William 'Bill' West, chief of the Protective Service Training Branch, the regular cars go through a set of high-performance brakes every class, and high-performance tires every two or three classes.The school does have an armored car with four-inch thick glass (it weighs about 12,000 pounds), which provides extra protection and time to get away.'Lets take the position of a security driver and a chauffer,' said West. 'When a situation arises, the chauffeur is going...to get scared because he won't know what to do. The security driver is going to find out what to do and fast. When...someone is shooting at his car, or tries to block it, a chauffer may slam on the brakes or panic.'But, West added, the security driver or Protective Service agent will take immediate action, using a number of different tactics and techniques they learn to protect the 'principals,' and get them to a safe location.Students can use their new driving skills in real life as well, Larson pointed out, especially accident-avoidance techniques. In fact, he was able to use a controlled ram to keep both himself and another driver safe when a collision in his private vehicle was unavoidable.'You learn so much here that you just don't get anywhere else,' said Special Agent Jason Herndon after undergoing the training. 'We have a lot of guys, Reservists, who come in and they're police officers and they admit, 'We never had any of this driving.' So they can take it back to their units in the civilian world and train them as well.'RELATED STORIES",2010/05/27,snopes,0

The D.C. commissioners, charged by Congress with building the new city under the direction of the president, initially planned to import workers from Europe to meet their labor needs. However, response to recruitment was dismal and soon they turned to African Americans—both enslaved and free—to provide the bulk of labor that built the White House, the United States Capitol, and other early government buildings.A slave coffle passing the Capitol grounds, 1815, published in A Popular History of the United States, 1876.Library of CongressShow Me MoreStonemason Collen Williamson trained enslaved people on the spot at the government's quarry at Aquia, Virginia.

I always do my best to treat people, including those I disagree with, respectfully and will continue to do so— Sarah Sanders (@PressSec) June 23, 2018Following her tweet, supporters of President Donald Trump and pro-Trump trolls started targeting the restaurant, its staff, its owner, and her family online. The avalanche of harassment so far has included doxxing her (publishing her personal contact information) on multiple online platforms including Twitter, Facebook, and message boards Voat and 4chan. Previous harassment campaigns organized by pro-Trump trolls have had dangerous , real-life consequences for their targets, including acts of violence and potentially dangerous pranks.On Voat, pro-Trump trolls called for a comprehensive harassment campaign and posted the personal online profiles of the members of the restaurant’s culinary team:Trolls uploaded pictures of the owner’s family, including her son, on 4chan threads that included death threats . They also posted what seemed to be her personal phone number on a now-archived thread:Another since-archived thread included her personal address and called on people to send her some “love mail”:On Twitter, even though the platform specifically prohibits users from sharing such sensitive information, people shared the restaurant owner’s personal phone number:Pro-Trump pages on Facebook were also part of it:The doxxing has been accompanied by promises of violence, and prominent trolls are already connecting the restaurant to the dangerous “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory and to “Q,” a fictitious person from a related conspiracy theory about the “deep state,” “QAnon.” Pro-Trump trolls pushed the Pizzagate conspiracy theory during the 2016 presidential election, claiming that celebrities and Democratic politicians had links to a pedophilia ring hidden in the basement of a Washington, D.C., pizzeria. Even though the conspiracy theory was debunked, the story still inspired a man to open fire inside the family restaurant, which he claimed he had entered to self-investigate.so looks like it took just 24 hrs for the Red Hen to get Pizzagate'd. jesus. pic.twitter.com/doJfh0mPTi— Charlie Warzel (@cwarzel) June 25, 2018It is extremely worrisome to see trolls sharing the restaurant owner’s personal information, particularly given the dangerous incident that followed the targeted harassment of Parkland shooting survivor David Hogg. After trolls made his personal information public and spread it on message boards, someone made a prank call to the police and claimed there was a hostage situation inside Hogg’s home, prompting deployment of an armed police team. The act is known as “swatting,” and it’s a harassment tool that trolls aim at their targets; on at least one occasion, it has proved fatal .Another terrifying consequence of harassment campaigns unleashed by pro-Trump trolls is that they sometimes target parties with no connection to the situation spurring the attacks. In this case, a D.C. restaurant with the same name as the Lexington establishment has been ""bombarded with calls, emails,"" and ""death threats"" -- and was egged over the weekend -- despite having no connection to the Virginia Red Hen. Similarly, after the February school shooting in Parkland, FL, Infowars host Alex Jones accused an innocent man of being the shooter, unleashing “ridicule, harassment, and threats of violence” against him.Media outlets, however, seem to be focusing their coverage on whether the actions of a private business owner who followed her conscience reflect intolerable incivility. Meanwhile, reporting on the dangerous harassment and attacks that have followed is taking a back seat.The fact that Trumpers physically assaulting a restaurant unrelated to the controversy will attract less coverage than Red Hen declining to serve Sanders is a reminder that the actual issue here is the disproportionate clout of conservative propaganda television and not civility.— Matthew Yglesias (@mattyglesias) June 25, 2018Natalie Martinez provided research for this piece.Short Link",2018/06/25,snopes,1
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-body-finite-energy/,exercising is counterproductive because it expends more quickly the finite amount of energy a human has.,False,"['donald trump', ' health', ' medical', ' science']",https://www.theatlantic.com/,https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/05/trumps-unfitness/526677/,2017/05/18,"No, Mr. President, Exercise Does Not Deplete EnergyA correctionJames HamblinMay 15, 2017President Donald Trump holds up an Air Force Academy football jersey presented to him by team captain Weston SteelhammerSusan Walsh / APIn September, a concerned elementary-school teacher asked a question of the soon-to-be President Donald Trump from among the audience at The Dr. Oz Show: “How would you go about handling the obesity problem in the country—especially among children—and the fact that many schools are not providing enough exercise and recess time?”The septuagenarian did not hesitate to respond. Words came in authoritative bursts: “That is a school thing, to a certain extent. I guess you could say it’s a hereditary thing, too, I would imagine. It certainly is a hereditary thing, but a lot of schools aren’t providing proper food because they have budget problems, and they’re buying cheaper food and not as good of food, and the big thing—when I went to school I always loved sports, and I would always—I loved to eat and I loved sports, and it worked, because I could do both.”Oz sat beside him, nodding intently. Trump continued. “A lot of schools today, they don’t have sports programs, and that is a big problem. I would try and open that up. I’m a big believer in the whole world of sports. I would try and open that up.”The “whole world of sports” seemed an homage to ESPN’s “wide world of sports,” and apparently represents the extent of the televisual enthusiast’s understanding of the causes of obesity. It is the condition at the heart of the $3 trillion in annual health-care spending that shapes the national economy and results in stifling political discord. These are costs that could be slashed by comprehensive approaches to preventive medicine—communities built to optimize health, where people have the opportunities to keep themselves out of the hospital. That includes schools that emphasize the importance of recess and play and eating well. A lack of emphasis on sports programs is a distant concern.What’s more, this idea of using sports as a means to physical health is at odds with comments by the president that have just now come uncomfortably to light.I don’t check my phone much when running, but when something comes from The Atlantic’s David Graham, I stop what I’m doing. I was finishing a run along Rock Creek on Sunday evening when he alerted me to a story from The Washington Post . The headline: “Trump Thinks That Exercising Too Much Uses Up the Body’s ‘Finite’ Energy.”Good Lord. I turned for home and started typing, full of energy from the run. Graham wasn’t the only one who sent me the story that night. It cites a Trump quote in the latest New Yorker , in which the commander-in-chief said he gave up sports after college because he “believed the human body was like a battery, with a finite amount of energy, which exercise only depleted.”This is exactly right. The body is a battery. The key to longevity and power is to sit perfectly still and keep the body constantly full of food. It will last indefinitely.No, I mean, no. This is wrong. The Washington Post notes, “Experts say this argument is flawed because the human body actually becomes stronger with exercise.” I would argue that this is not an argument but a false statement. The accurate exercise-battery analogy is that exercise charges the human battery. And the body is a sort of battery that gets stronger the more it is charged.I was hopeful that it might be an off-the-cuff colloquial misfire from Trump, but then found that writers Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher recounted a similar instance in their recent book Trump Revealed:After college, after Trump mostly gave up his personal athletic interests, he came to view time spent playing sports as time wasted. Trump believed the human body was like a battery, with a finite amount of energy, which exercise only depleted. So he didn’t work out. When he learned that John O’Donnell, one of his top casino executives, was training for an Ironman triathlon, he admonished him, “You are going to die young because of this.”“You are going to die young because of this” is something I say often to people, but never earnestly. It’s always a joke.Here it doesn’t seem to be. The idea of the body’s energy as a finite resource fits well into Trump’s zero-sum worldview. In deals, there are losers and winners. Taxing people to create social programs is simply a drain on taxpayers. He frames the world in ways at odds with the idea that rising tides lift all boats, that investment in a healthy society pays dividends all around. As my colleague Stephanie Hayes noted in these pages last month, since our attitudes about our own health tend to be emblematic of deeper beliefs and values, a president who is committed to working out is seen to have more “self-control, discipline, and a willingness to exert oneself in pursuit of a goal—ideas that align with the good old-fashioned American belief in meritocracy, however illusory.”The wrongness of the battery metaphor matters in principle because a president should have a better understanding of science, and be willing to acknowledge his limits and defer to experts, especially in the domain of health. Trump has done the opposite repeatedly, as in the cases of vaccines and climate change, showing that he is rather willing to take strong and dangerous stances.In the case of exercise, this also matters because of the scope of the problem that affects his electorate. Some two-thirds of American adults are classified as overweight or obese. Trump’s own body-mass index lands him on the line between those two distinctions. This is a socioeconomic disease that all leaders need to understand, but especially those in the states where more people voted for Trump, according to the latest maps of the problem.One of the very few clearly proven approaches to preventing and reversing the adverse effects of obesity is to lead an active lifestyle—as active as possible. Yes there is a point of diminishing returns, as could be the case with people who run 50-mile races, or who exercise to the point of neglecting professional and social obligations, leading to the decline of marriages and erosion of joints, et cetera. But this is a fringe problem relative to the epidemic of sedentary lives. Should the country ever reach a point where over-exercising is the norm, a president might speak out about our depleted National Battery.For now, what we know is that exercising regularly—or leading a generally active lifestyle—is key to longevity, from preventing cardiovascular disease to cancers to depression to irritable bowels. For some kids who have been diagnosed with ADHD, exercise can be as effective as amphetamines. Though many school districts are choosing the latter. In the face of such consequences, the country needs leaders to be above bass, guttural, reflexive understandings of the natural world—and to treat health as a pursuit where gains are not zero sum.We want to hear what you think about this article.

The risky orgies are usually attended by gay men and offer the so-called 'thrill' of not knowing whether or not you will be infected . Doctors in Barcelona have seen a rise in the number of such parties, which they claim is a sign that people have ""lost respect"" for HIV. Dr Josep Mallolas of Hospital Clinic Barcelona told el Periodico : ""There is everything: sex roulette parties, or sex parties you can only attend if you already have HIV."" He added that some of the events are known as 'blue' parties because attendees take anti-viral drugs to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus.

Praying before games with my teammates, well before the anthem, is being used for your propaganda?! Just sad, I feel like you guys should have to be better than this...,"" Ertz said.Fox News showed pictures of Eagles players while discussing NFL protests.

Brooks was later released by the team, and did not play for the Eagles in the regular season.The flap marks another chapter in Trump's ongoing feud with the country's most popular sports league over the anthem demonstrations that began in 2016 with former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick.NFL owners approved a new policy governing the pregame ritual last month, requiring players to stand during the anthem if they are on the field.

I have loved Coyotes’ all wildlife since childhood. I commend you for your open heart and honesty. I grew up in a family of hunters and it always grieved me to see the lack of compassion for the animals killed. Family did not sport hunt but just for food. Even so there was an attitude that animals don’t feel, that they are nothing and were put here for us to use. Ok, I get the “for us to use” part but it has grown through the ages into “for us to abuse” attitude. Wiley is gorgeous, I am so glad that you were able to rescue him in spite of rules…you have met all the requirements as you would for a pet dog. Glad he is neutered and has all his vacinations. I know that you also are aware that he is a wild animal at heart. I hope that he will live out his days with your family. Being neutered gives him that chance. You are his pack, he sings for you. I hope you sing back to him. Thank you so much for your “change of heart and also mind set”. Proves it can be done if one is open to learning. I so much would like the war against wildlife to end. We as humans have invaded, conquered and irradicated so many wild families. The reintroduced wolves are now being killed off again, open season on coyotes. They are the sanitizers of the wild. It breaks my heart that man cannot see or feel what they do. You have, I know you will use this knowledge to help others see more clearly that animals do indeed FEEL, BOND, RELATE and COMMUNICATE just as we do with our families. My hat is off to you, Patricia and all that are working to change laws and protect what we still have. God Bless you, your family and sweet Wiley.",2013/02/17,snopes,0

Bernie Sanders said, ""I happen to believe that it is wrong for the government to be telling a woman what to be doing with her own body.""Democratic debate: Background on the auto bailoutHe chided Republicans who broadly oppose government interference in people's personal lives, ""but somehow on this issue they want to tell every woman in America what she should do with her body.""Asked more specifically if he would support restrictions on abortions for pregnancies farther along than five months, Sanders simply responded, ""I am very strongly pro-choice. That is a choice to be made between a woman, her physician and her family.""Clinton, by contrast, noted that she has gone on the record as in favor of some ""late-pregnancy regulation that would have exceptions for the life and health of the mother.""However, Clinton stressed that she objects to the recent efforts in Congress to pass a federal law banning abortions after 20 weeks with no exceptions. ""Under Roe v. Wade, it is appropriate to say in these circumstances"" that abortion rights may be restricted, she said -- ""so long as there's an exception for the life and health of the mother.""Clinton also stressed her more general support for abortion rights, and for Planned Parenthood.""Under Roe v. Wade, women have this right to make this highly personal decision with their family,"" she said. ""We've got to continue to stand up for a woman's right to make these decisions and to defend Planned Parenthood.""Abortion rights supporters and advocates have called on debate moderators to ask the Democrats about the issue, using the hashtag #AskAboutAbortion.— Planned Parenthood (@PPact) March 7, 2016The Republicans, meanwhile, have already used multiple debates to express their opposition to abortion rights. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida last month explained why he supports bans on abortion rights , even in cases of rape or incest.""I do support protection for the life of the mother because I'm pro-life,"" he said. ""I just believe deeply that all human life is worthy of protection of our laws. If I'm president and there's a bill that's passed that saves lives but it has exceptions, I'll sign it. But I do believe deeply that all human life is worthy of the protection of laws. I've already said, for me, the issue of life is not a political issue and I want to be frank. I would rather lose an election than be wrong on the issue of life.""In a highly unusual move for Republican, GOP front runner Donald Trump has expressed his opposition to abortion while nevertheless defending Planned Parenthood. ""As far as Planned Parenthood is concerned, I'm pro-life,"" Trump said in the tenth GOP debate . ""I'm totally against abortion, having to do with Planned Parenthood.

That partnership ends in 2016.Disney has also agreed to give Netflix nonexclusive streaming rights to more of its older titles â including ""Dumbo,"" ""Pocahontas"" and ""Alice in Wonderland"" â starting immediately.Netflix's chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, called the deal ""a bold leap forward for Internet television.""""We are incredibly pleased and proud this iconic family brand is teaming with Netflix to make it happen,"" he said.Netflix stock soared on the news, rising $10.65, or 14%, to $85.65.Shares in Starz's parent company, Liberty Media Corp., fell $5.49, or 5%, to $105.56.Currently, Netflix has nonexclusive rights to movies from Paramount Pictures, Lionsgate and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer via a deal with pay channel Epix, as well as an array of library titles from other studios. Its only exclusive movie rights come from independent studios such as Relativity Media and DreamWorks Animation. It also has a wide variety of television reruns.Sarandos and Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings have long said the company wanted to get exclusive pay TV rights to films from one of Hollywood's six major studios to boost its online entertainment service.PHOTOS: Disney without PixarHowever, Hastings has also at times downplayed the importance of new movies. Netflix previously had streaming rights to Disney and Sony movies via a deal with Starz. In January, investors expressed their concerns that the pending disappearance of those movies would hurt the service. Hastings said in a letter to investors that Disney films accounted for only 2% of domestic streaming and the loss would not be felt.Since then, though, the Disney movie slate has become more attractive. At that time, Netflix did not have access to movies from Disney's Marvel superhero unit or the ""Star Wars"" titles from its pending acquisition of Lucasfilm Ltd.The end of the Starz agreement accelerated a trend that has seen Netflix evolve into a television company, with reruns of shows such as ""Mad Men"" accounting for about two-thirds of the content streamed by users.With several original programs launching next year, including the Kevin Spacey political drama ""House of Cards,"" and a direct connection to a growing number of Internet-enabled televisions, Netflix is on the verge of standing on par with many TV networks.Netflix charges $8 a month for its streaming service, while premium cable networks such as HBO cost $13 to $18 a month, and that's on top of a monthly bill for other channels that typically exceeds $50. It remains to be seen whether the addition of Disney products and more original programming could lead Netflix to increase its price.PHOTOS: Hollywood back lot momentsThe Netflix spending spree could continue, with Sarandos telling Bloomberg News on Monday that his company would bid for rights to Sony movies when its Starz deal expires.Netflix might have a tougher time wresting away the rights to Warner Bros., 20th Century Fox or Universal Pictures releases from their current deals with HBO, which like Warner is part of Time Warner Inc. Paramount, Lionsgate and MGM are almost certain to stick with Epix, of which the trio are co-owners.Disney's family-friendly films are particularly valuable to Netflix, however, because young viewers are active users of the service. Last year it launched a separate Just for Kids section of its website and apps.Although terms were not disclosed, a person close to the matter said Netflix could ultimately pay more than $300 million annually for Disney movies.This year, HBO cut a deal with 20th Century Fox for its movies, at an estimated price of more than $200 million annually.In so-called output deals, pay TV providers typically pay 10% to 12% of the U.S. box office of each film, up to $200 million.For Starz, losing the Disney movies means the channel will have to create more original content to fill the void, just as rival cable network Showtime did when it lost most of its movie content over the last several years. Showtime, a unit of CBS Corp., has managed to make this work by launching several successful shows, including ""Homeland,"" ""Dexter"" and ""Nurse Jackie.""Starz's track record with original programming has been more mixed. Its show ""Spartacus"" has performed well, but its ambitious political drama ""Boss,"" starring Kelsey Grammer, was recently canceled.""Our decision not to extend the agreement for Disney output ... allows us the opportunity to implement our plan to dramatically ramp up our investment in exclusive, premium-quality original series which will best meet the needs of our distributors and subscribers,"" Starz said in a statement.Janney Capital Markets analyst Tony Wible called the deal a positive for Netflix, writing in a research note, ""This exclusivity should help them defend against competitors and may reinvigorate [subscriber] growth at a substantial cost.""Stern Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia had a more mixed reaction.""From a content perspective, this appears to be a major coup for Netflix,"" he said. ""However, without knowledge of the financial terms, we think it would be premature to assume this is a net positive.""",2012/12/04,snopes,1

Donald Glover is in it! So is James Earl Jones, back playing Mufasa. Its going to be directed by Jon Favreau (the actor/director, not the speechwriter/podcaster), coming off the success of his live-action Jungle Book film.Its probably going to be heartwarming and nostalgic. What it wont be is live-action.STOP IT Dana SchwartzI get the temptation to quickly distinguish this new wave of Disney films from their two-dimensional animated originalsCinderella, Beauty and the Beast, and The Jungle Book can all be called live-action because even as they featured magical pumpkins and talking candlesticks and uncanny-valley bears, they also featured humans. There were real human actors, on sets, saying lines that were being recorded while their faces were also being recorded, to be made visible on a screen.A CGI monster and a human child DisneyThe Lion King has no people in it.Lets define some terms, just to make sure were all on the same page. According to Merriam-Webster, live-action refers to cinematography that is not produced by animation.Wikipedia begins its entry on Computer animation with this sentence: Computer animation is the process used for generating animated images. The more general term computer-generated imagery (CGI) encompasses both static scenes and dynamic images, while computer animation only refers to the moving images. CGI is, by definition, animation.Pictured: Science Dana SchwartzI would argue that a film qualifies as live-action if it features cinematography not produced by animation (computer or otherwise) in any appreciable amount. Regardless of how much green screen scenery is being used, or whether the lead actor is doing all of his lines opposite a ping-pong ball on a stick, if theres an actor, it almost certainly counts as live action.I have no idea whether Jon Favreau is flying to the savannah and filming with trained lions that are going to perform opposite other lions with peanut butter in their mouth to make it look like theyre talking. Maybe he is. But if The Jungle Book was was any indication, hell be doing The Lion King via green screen...this time with no humans characters. Itll be a computer animated lion voiced by Childish Gambino, no different from a computer animated toy cowboy (or mustachioed nightmare) voiced by Tom Hanks. Just because our animation has gotten better doesnt mean its not animation.Facts Dana SchwartzWe can call this one the CGI Lion King, or even The Lion King remake. But until I see a leaked set picture of some trained hyenas, I refuse to call this movie live-action.",2017/03/28,snopes,0

The image is a little bigger for our purpose therefore we need to crop it so we can have a nice portrait image suitable for our magazine cover. You can crop an image using the Crop tool located in the tools bar section. With the Crop tool selected Drag over the part of the image you want to keep to create a marquee.It’s is not necessary to be precise, we can fix later.If you need to move the marquee just click inside and drag over to the right or left until the marquee is in the desired position. When our marquee selection is in the desire position press Enter to crop our image and now we have a nice pic to work with. Because this picture is nice and clean we don’t have to worry about retouching, so let’s focus on the magazine design and typography. There are many ways to create the red border around our cover, but I want to show you an easy and painless way to do it. To make a marquee selection can be a little tricky if you are a beginner so I recommend to use the Rule as guide. To make the Rule visible go to the menu bar and click on view and then in the drop down menu click on Rules and the rule will show up around your work stage. With the inverse selection press ALT + Backspace to fill the selection with red color ( make sure the foreground color is set to Red) and there we have the red edges around the cover! sweet isn’t it?. Press Ctrl + D lo deselect the marquee. Now we are ready to move on and fill our image with some Text. Select the text tool, set the font type to trajanus brick, in case you don’t have this font type in your computer you can download for free from: http://www.sostars.com/trajanus-bricks-font,although this font is not the same as the used in Time’s magazine, it is pretty close for our purpose in this tutorial. Make sure to select your font color to red. Now that we have our Time text we need to fix something; you may noticed that there is too much space between the letter T and the I, let’s fix it. I’ll show a trick to solve this situation that you can use it in some others projects where you need to apply special effects to a single text character.In your layers panel right click in your text layer and from the menu select rasterize now select the rectangular marquee to draw a selection on the letter T , now with the right arrow in our keyboard click a few times to put the letter T in place close to the I, press Ctrl+D to clear the selection, now you have your TIME text ready to put in place, just click in the move tool and put in the position as shown in the final image above. Now we are ready to put some text in our shape. Just place your text inside the shape. For the other text in our magazine I used Times New Roman font, white, bold.set the appropriate size and type any text you want. Finally you can add a barcode image, get one from google or use the image above, resize it if necessary and put in place, and you have your TIME magazine front cover ready for publishing.",2010/08/06,snopes,0

The project is part of Toyota’s plan to spend $10 billion on capital investments in the United States over the next five years, as announced on Jan. 9. The investment will be used for retooling, new equipment and cutting-edge technologies at its Princeton, Indiana, plant in order to manufacture an additional 40,000 Highlanders per year, Toyota said in a statement. The production is scheduled to begin in fall 2019. The plant made more than 400,000 vehicles in 2016 and currently employs about 5,300 workers. “This expansion project is part of Toyota’s localization strategy to build vehicles where they are sold,” the company said, making no reference to Trump. On Jan. 5, Trump railed against Toyota for its 2015 announcement of plans to build a Mexico factory. Toyota announced the $10 billion plan on Jan. 9, saying that it has spent $21.9 billion on direct investment in the United States and has 10 manufacturing facilities, 1,500 dealerships and 136,000 employees in the country. Indiana is where Vice President Mike Pence served as governor. Toyota President Akio Toyoda met with Pence in Washington on Jan. 10. Since his election in November, Trump has been touting his “America First” economic agenda by pressing companies to keep jobs and production in the United States. He won such key industrial states as Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania with promises of protecting jobs. On Monday, Trump accused Japan and China of engaging in trade practices that he said are “not fair” to American companies, while singling out auto trade with Japan as falling into that category. “If they’re going to charge tax to our countries — if as an example, we sell a car into Japan and they do things to us that make it impossible to sell cars in Japan . . . it’s not fair,” he said in a meeting with business leaders. In a related move, Trump on Tuesday urged the chief executives of the Big Three U.S. automakers to build more cars in the United States. In return, the Republican president promised to cut regulations and taxes to make it more attractive for businesses to operate in the country.

He is also charged with kidnapping a woman and keeping her chained on his property in rural Woodruff, South Carolina. Kala Brown's rescue on Thursday led to the break in the 13-year-old cold case. Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright said Kohlhepp also showed police officers the grave sites of two of his other victims buried on his 95-acre property on Saturday. That's in addition to the body that was found on Friday in a shallow grave at the site. Wright and Coroner Rusty Clevenger identified that victim as 32-year-old Charles Carver, the boyfriend of Brown, who was found in a locked metal container on Thursday.Investigators brought Kohlhepp back to his property late Saturday afternoon as part of a massive search of the area.

Pictured right is a deck of cards made by Lucas' father and passed out to inmates in South Carolina prisons The building that once housed the Superbike Motorsports shop in Chesnee, South Carolina (pictured) has been abandoned since the quadruple murder rocked the city 13 years agoDetectives told DailyMail.com they have begun sifting through missing persons records as they continued the search for more bodies in farmland where Brown was held captive. It emerged on Friday that Kohlhepp was released from prison in Arizona in 2001 after being convicted of raping a 14-year-old at gunpoint.At 15 years old, he was convicted of raping his teenage neighbor at gunpoint and threatening to kill her siblings if she called police. Kohlhepp had to register as a sex offender. And he was described by a judge as 'impulsive, explosive, and preoccupied with sexual content' from the age of nine. But that didn't stop him from getting a South Carolina real estate license in 2006 and building a firm.Wright said 'it's strange' that Kohlhepp managed the pretext of a normal life for so long.Scott Waldrop, who's lived next door to the Woodruff property for nearly 22 years, said he thought Kohlhepp was a serious Doomsday 'prepper' who liked his privacy, but 'he didn't seem like a threat.'Waldrop said when he saw the container, it was full of bottled water and canned goods. After buying the property two years ago, Kohlhepp immediately started putting a chain link fence around it.Waldrop said Kohlhepp paid him to put no trespassing signs, cut trees for him and other odd jobs around the property. Kohlhepp also installed deer cameras and put bear traps throughout.'I was the only one he let over there, I think because I laughed at his jokes and listened to him,' he said. 'I just hate to know somebody who's done something like this.'Kohlhepp has a house about nine miles away in Moore, where neighbor Ron Owen said Kohlhepp was very private, but when they did talk across the fence, he was a 'big bragger.'Kohlhepp liked to talk about the money he made day trading online, for example, and about his two BMWs. He recently told Owen, 76, that he'd spent $80,000 on the chain link fence.'We didn't see any signs whatsoever that this was going on,' Owen said. 'My first reaction's a baseball bat, but I know I'm not to take that in my own hands. God will deal with him.' Brown (left), 30, was found chained up in a metal container on Kohlhepp's property after going missing in August. Authorities announced Saturday that a body found on the property was that of Charlie Carver (right), 32, her boyfriendMeanwhile, a visibly shaken Sheriff Wright told reporters on Saturday: 'I do think this helps with a little bit of closure but I don't think this make everything better. We certainly wanted a different outcome.'Authorities were still trying to determine how long Carver had been buried. They didn't find any ID on Carver's body and they said it wasn't immediately possible to identify him based on his appearance.His mother Joanne Shiflet had told the Greenville News earlier Saturday: 'Until I see a body, I can't give up. For this to be over, I have to see him.' Brown said her alleged captor had shot dead her boyfriend and told her there were four victims in all.Scores of officers are searching the farmland, which sits back from the main road and where Brown was held captive in a container.Wright told DailyMail.com: 'I'm going to be honest with you. I don't chain my dogs up and I wouldn't treat my dogs the way this lady was treated.' Scores of officers are searching the farmland, which sits back from the main road and where Brown was held captive in a container. Investigators are pictured excavating one part of the property on Friday One reported asked Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright (pictured) Saturday night if investigators thought they had a serial killer on their hands. 'It appears to be that that's what we're looking at,' Wright said Police search for evidence on property owned by registered Kohlhepp today. Officers have marked off areas for searching in a grid pattern and special lights were brought in today to provide for night searchesHe said Brown was fully clothed when she was found by police but the container had no air conditioning light.She said her captor had fed her while keeping her in chains around her neck and ankles.Asked about the enormity of the task in searching the land for more bodies, he said officers were well prepared.'It doesn't make any difference if it was 500 acres because we think we have evidence out here. The men are resolved not to give up until we find everything that we need to find, period.'It doesn't matter how long it takes. It is not an issue. This is one of the biggest crime scenes that I have ever been involved in.'We are trying to make certain that nobody walks through anything and overlooks anything.' Investigators relied on cadaver dogs, other means of investigation and 'God's grace' to find Carver's body, Wright told the Greenville News. Officers have marked off areas for searching in a grid pattern.

Kohlhepp chillingly responded to the post: 'Why? Serial killers need love, too' (pictured)Brown is said to be doing well and texting friends who supported the hunt for her after she and her boyfriend disappeared on August 30. She was discovered on Thursday by deputies acting on a tip-off they received. She and Carver had last been seen on August 30. His car was found on the property on Thursday night.Late Friday evening, Brown's family released a statement saying the brave survivor needed privacy to cope with what had happened.'While Kala is doing well physically, emotionally she's having good moments and bad moments,' the family said.'She's requesting privacy at this time and will make an official statement as soon as the authorities give her permission to do so. Right now Kala needs time to process and begin to cope with the events that have occurred. 'She thanks everyone for their love and support.'On April 19, four months before the kidnapping, Kohlhepp replied to a post that reads: '(People need) to start appreciating the effort I put in to not be a serial killer.'Kohlhepp chillingly responded to the post: 'Why? Serial killers need love, too.'Spartenburg coroner Rusty Clavenger confirmed a corpse had been unearthed by police, less than 24 hours into the investigation of the sprawling property in Woodruff, South Carolina. About two weeks after Brown went missing, Kohlhepp posted on his Facebook about 'filling ravines' on his property. It is unclear if this was in the area where the deceased body was found. Flowers were left on a fence surrounding property owned by Kohlhepp, in Moore, South Carolina, on November 5 Brown has told investigators that there may be other victims and speculated that there were as many as four bodies buried on the property (pictured as police dig for evidence) Carver's body was unearthed by police, less than 24 hours into the investigation (pictured, police search a field on property owned by Kohlhepp on Thursday) 'We're trying to get all this sorted out and figure out what were going to charge him with. One of the charges will be kidnapping, it could be murder. It could be a number of things,' Wright said after the search began Todd Kohlhepp (pictured in blue shirt) appeared at a bond hearing at the Spartanburg County Detention Center Friday. He is likely to face at least one murder charge, and is being held without bond.

She added: 'She told us this individual did kill him in her presence.'Kohlhepp had a public defender during his appearance. He was not handcuffed, but sat with his hands behind his back.Barnette then went on to tell the hearing Brown was found with chains around her neck and ankles, and that addition chains were found in Kohlhepp's bedroom, along with an 'unbelievable' amount of ammunition.Investigators also found silenced 9mm handguns and assault weapons, he said.He is to remain in jail without bond until his first court hearing on January 19, the judge ruled. Investigators went to Kohlhepp's Moore, South Carolina, home and impounded his vehicles (pictured) after he was arrested on Thursday A county sherriff helicopter lands at a property owned by Kohlhepp, where Carver's body was found Friday afternoon Police are seen standing around a hole in the ground that had been dug as part of the search for bodies on the property FridayA look at Kohlhepp's Facebook page suggests that the man became considerably more active online after Carver and Brown's disappearance on August 30. Chilling: In a chilling Facebook post 16 days after Brown and Carver went missing, Kohlhepp posted about how most people who vanish turn up againBetween the start of July and the end of August, he only posted nine times, mostly showing properties that Kohlhepp - a realtor - was selling.But in September he posted more than 40 times - sometimes multiple times a day, and more frequently about his feelings and thoughts on life.The first post in this more active phase is on August 31, the day after the couple disappeared, in which he appears to have been focusing on the news.'Its wednesday, the trash people picked up my trash at 5:30 this morning,' he wrote. 'this post is still way more interesting than whats on the news.. carry on.'A more chilling post came on September 15, when he wrote: 'Reading the news.. this person missing, that person missing, another person missing.. oh wait.. that person just went to beach with friend, other person found with her parole violation boyfriend...'In the event I become missing, please note no one would take me. I eat too much and I am crabby, they would just bring me back or give me 20 bucks for a cab ride. Abuse: Kohlhepp also said that his family would hit him for as little as setting down a cup too hard at the table. His Facebook usage increased dramatically after the couple disappeared'Most likely if I am missing, its because my dumb ass did something on that tractor again and I am too stubborn to go to the doctor... I got 9 lives.. I aint done yet..' And in a post from September 26, he talks about how he was beaten by several members of his family.'In my family you got backhanded for talking back or being disrespectful... actually acting up ended up a spanking that was epic.. you do NOT want to make the same mistake in my family again,' he said, going on to complain about rioters he'd seen on the news.'My family believed raising me was a group effort,' he added in the comments. 'That means when I messed up, mom beat my a**, step father beat my a** when he got home.. next time I went to grandparents I got my a** beat... they made a believer out of you..'He continued: 'you stood up for anthem, you shut up with adults spoke.. you sure as hell never set that cup down hard on the table.. noooooooooooo... and cop an attitude over anything... well.. you lost tv, bike.. friends that month..'After the spanking.. you just didnt act up... these kids ( and adults ) just dont know.... damn shame too.. they might learn to appreciate if they did.'Carver's family have said that some of the Facebook posts that he apparently made after his disappearance were out of character, and they believe that his account was hacked by someone who made fake updates. Police stand guard outside a building on the property owned by Kohlhepp, who was arrested after a woman was found chained up in a metal container Police use a backhoe on the massive property in South Carolina as part of the ongoing search for as many as four bodies investigators believe may be buried on the landHelicopters were seen at the property on Friday morning, along with a backhoe and police dogs that were being used in nearby woods as part of the search.A Greenville News reporter who flew over the property noted on Twitter that there was what appeared to be a camouflaged metal storage shed on the land.Kohlhepp was also arrested for the kidnapping and sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl in 1986, when he was 15. He was jailed from 1987 to 2001 over the incident.Court documents, obtained by WFXG, detail how Kohlhepp pointed a 'small blue steel handgun at (the victim's) head' and led her into his house. Inside, he 'placed gray duct tape over her mouth' and 'tied her hands together with a rope', before removing her clothes and 'forcing the victim to have sexual intercourse with him'. The judge who ruled on the case described Kohlhepp as 'impulsive, explosive, and preoccupied with sexual content' from the age of nine. 'He has not changed. He has been unabatedly aggressive to others and destructive of property since nursery school. 'He destroys his own clothing, personal possessions and pets apparently on whim,' court papers state. The documents also cite a psychiatrist's report that says the 45-year-old has 'emotional difficulties and poor impulse control'. Kohlhepp got his realtor's license in 2006, before background checks for applicants were made compulsory. A mugshot of Kohlhepp after his arrest shows him with a cruel smirk. TODD KOHLHEPP'S SHOCKING PAST AS A 'MONSTER' WHO WAS JAILED FOR RAPING A 14-YEAR-OLD GIRL Kohlhepp raped a 14-year-old girl at gunpoint in 1986, when he was 15, and openly admitted to the crime when police arrived to question him. This mugshot from that arrest shows him with a cruel smirk. He was jailed from 1987-2001Court documents from an incident in 1986 that saw Todd Kohlhepp jailed for 14 years have shed light on his shocking past. Kohlhepp, who owns the property where Kala Brown was found chained up like a dog in a metal container on Thursday, kidnapped and sexual assaulted a girl when he was 15.A sentencing report, obtained by WFXG, claims Kohlhepp lured the girl outside by telling her an ex-boyfriend wanted to talk to her.When the two were outside, he then pointed a 'small blue steel handgun at her head' and 'told her to walk down the alley towards his house.' Once they got into Kohlhepp's bedroom, according to the documents, he duct taped her mouth, tied her hands together, and, 'removed her clothes, then his clothes and forced the victim to have sexual intercourse with him.'The victim allegedly told police Kohlhepp had threatened to kill her and her siblings if she told anyone about the incident, however she still called police when she got home.The document continues: 'When contacted by police, the defendant was holding a .22 caliber rifle which was pointed at the ceiling. When questioned regarding this incident, the defendant fully admitted his guilt and indicated he used the victim's ex-boyfriend as a ploy.'The judge who ruled on the case described Kohlhepp as 'impulsive, explosive, and preoccupied with sexual content' from the age of nine.'He has not changed. He has been unabatedly aggressive to others and destructive of property since nursery school. He destroys his own clothing, personal possessions and pets apparently on whim,' court papers state. The documents also cite a psychiatrist's report that says the 45-year-old has 'emotional difficulties and poor impulse control'.It described him 'destroying his bedroom with a hammer; destroying other children's projects; hitting other children; cloroxing a goldfish; shooting a dog with a BB gun; being dismissed from the Boy Scouts because he was too disruptive; shredding his own clothes'.The judge's report said: 'He is extremely self-centered with high levels of anti-social personality functioning, and likely continuing aggressive behaviors toward others in the future.' Carver's family released a statement on Friday afternoon, shortly before Kohlhepp's bond hearing got underway and before authorities identified the deceased body as Carver's.'We, Charlie David Carver's family, would like to begin by saying how wonderful it is Kala has been found and that she is receiving care and is back with family and friends,' it read.'The outpouring of concern and affection from the community has been overwhelming and we are very thankful. 'At this time we know that no more than what has been reported within the media or statements made by law enforcement.'We ask that you continue to pray for Kala's healing and for David's safe return as well. In the meantime, we ask for some time to ourselves as we process events as they unfold.'Thank you for your understanding and expect updates as they become available.' Brown's close friend, Leah Miller, said the 30-year-old started working for Kohlhepp only weeks before she vanished.She said Brown helped Kohlhepp clear and clean properties before he put them on the market, according to Greenville Online. 'I was supposed to be helping Kala, but I recently had neck surgery,' Miller said.

Another friend, Lindsey Mayson, told WSPA the suspected kidnapper did not seem like a bad person when she met him.'We went by his house to get a key before we went by his house to clean. Didn't seem like a person who would do anything to anybody. He seemed down to earth,' Mayson said. Earlier, Wright said Brown was 'chained inside the container like a dog' when police found her.He said she told deputies she had been kept in the container - which measured 30 feet by 15 feet by 10 or 12 feet - for two months and had been fed regularly. 'It's all by God's grace that we found that little girl alive,' Wright told NBC News. A massive investigation is now underway on the 100-acre property owned by Kohlhepp. Authorities search a field on the property above A deputy is seen leaving out of Kohlhepp's home carrying a computer on ThursdayBrown was taken to local hospital for treatment and Wright said she was 'obviously traumatized' but 'alive and well,' according to The State. Anderson Police Chief Jim Stewart said his department's investigation into the disappearance of Brown and Carver led authorities to the property near Woodruff, 80 miles northwest of the state capital of Columbia, where the woman was found.Stewart said more than a dozen search warrants were issued.'We got computer and cellphone records that ultimately led us to the area in Woodruff,' Stewart said. 'We knew that was the last place that a cellphone tied to this case pinged.' Kohlhepp was added to the sex offender registry in 1987 when he was convicted and sentenced to prison for kidnapping and raping a 14-year-old girl in Arizona in 1986.Records indicate Kohlhepp, orginally from Arizona, is a licensed real estate agent as well as a licensed pilot.

The next day, surveillance footage caught Carver leaving his work. That day marked the last the couple's friends or family heard from them.Carver and Brown had been dating just a few months, and had moved in together over the summer as Carver was going through a divorce.After failing to answer calls or messages from their loved ones, the couple's parents searched their apartment a few days later and found Brown's Pomeranian inside without any food or water. As the search for the missing couple started, Carver's Facebook - which he does not typically use - started becoming more and more active. Above shows an exchange on his Facebook page on September 6Medications and Brown's glasses were also left behind in the abandoned apartment.Neighbor Nicholas Arocho told Greenville Online that Carver's family took Pomeranian and paid the couple's rent for a couple of months after they disappeared. Relatives believe that the account has been hacked. Above, a message that someone received from Carver saying he was 'fine'The family later packed up the couple's belongings, he said.As the search for the missing couple started, Carver's Facebook - which he does not typically use - started becoming more active.On September 1, the account posted an update that the two had gotten married and then on September 6 his profile picture was changed. Other posts include links to stories and GoFundMe fundraisers for the missing couple.There are also several bizarre posts unrelated to the couple's disappearance, such as memes and comic book illustrations.The most recent post from October 2 reads: 'What color ribbon supports the cure for people who can't keep their nose out of other people's business?'When one concerned family member reached out to Carver on the account, they received a private message saying 'yes I'm fine'.But family members believe the account was hacked since the posts are not in Carver's style. Meanwhile, Brown's Facebook - which she used more than her boyfriend - has been completely silent. A friend of Brown and Carver's mother told police that someone the couple knows has 'given them problems before'.Brown's car was found in her apartment complex and her cellphone had not been used in the 48 hours before she vanished. Pictures of the couple and 'MISSING' posters were shared on Facebook after their disappearance in August Carver's car, a 2002 white Pontiac Grand Prix with a South Carolina license plate number HWY124, was found on the property on Thursday",2016/11/06,snopes,0

Flooding has long been an issue in the older parts of the city with poor drainage systems.In the Shantinagar suburb, and other areas, the blood and animal waste combined with the floods created these shocking scenes: residents wading through ankle-high bloody water.Image copyright Syful Islam Rony/Prothom AloImage caption Flooding is a perennial problem in the city of DhakaImage copyright Syful Islam Rony/Prothom AloImage caption A city waste management official said work was under way to clear the floodwatersFlooding and the annual sacrifice of livestock are regular occurrences in Dhaka, meaning most residents have not expressed much shock at these pictures.Why are animals slaughtered?The annual Eid al-Adha holiday, the second biggest celebration of the year for Muslims after Eid al-Fitr, commemorates when the prophet Ibrahim showed his readiness to sacrifice his son, Ishmael.Goats and cows are bought from markets by Muslim families and slaughtered, to thank Allah for sparing Ishmael, after an imam has read verses from the Koran.The meat is shared between family, friends and the poor, but the off-cuts and offal are discarded.Has this happened before?Almost every year there is some amount of blood on the streets as many families slaughter their livestock on the road.

Not even concerning the big things. It could be as easy as “I hope that was the kind of sandwich he likes” when packing your son’s lunch.But the worst nightmare of every single parent is having your kids taken away from you.For one mom in Cambridgeshire, this nightmare became reality after she did something most parents have probably done.The mother, who remains unnamed, had her two young children stripped from her hands after “continually ignoring advice.”That advice? Don’t let your kids sleep in your bed.Social workers raised concerns after they saw bruises on both kids. Social workers advised both parents to stop letting their kids sleep in the family bed, but they did not take the advice.A judge says he believes the bruises are unintentional, but were still caused by excessive force and rough handling by both parents. The youngest boy had bruises and a broken wrist when he was just months old.The case is kind of odd, because the judge says he has no doubts this mom loves her kids and keeps saying she wasn’t intentionally hurting her kids, but he says she’s still abusing them by co-sleeping. He also was shown evidence how this mother “always thinks she knows best” and ignores everyone’s advice.The children were both taken from their parents and, at the judge’s discretion, were put up for adoption. The claim is that after being warned by professionals since the birth of her first child to not allow the children to co-sleep with them, neither parent took any measure to protect their children.The entire case seems fishy, and as though they’re not revealing more aspects of the story that would make everything connect.It’s still a scary thought, though.

Can I expunge my California Penal Code 25850 PC conviction?If you are granted probation in a misdemeanor or felony Penal Code 25850 PC case, you may expunge your California criminal record once you successfully complete the probationary period. However, the judge can deny you an expungement if you suffer a probation violation or fail to adhere to all the terms and conditions of probation.50And if you are charged with carrying a loaded firearm in public as a felony, the court may be willing to reduce the wobbler from a felony to a misdemeanor .51 The court may also grant an early termination of probation if you comply with all the terms and conditions of probation for the first year or two.525.3.

In other words, the question presented for determination, whether section 12031, subdivision (a) applies to the weapon known as a ‘Taser' is answered in the affirmative.”)California Penal Code 16250 -- As used in this part, ""BB device"" means any instrument that expels a projectile, such as a BB or a pellet, not exceeding 6mm caliber, through the force of air pressure, gas pressure, or spring action, or any spot marker gun.Note: Since these weapons rely on the force of air pressure and not combustion, they do not qualify as firearms.California Jury Instructions – Criminal – CALCJI 16.431 -- The term “public place” means any place which is open to common or general use, participation and enjoyment by members of the public.

(a) Nothing in Section 25850 [California's carrying a loaded firearm law] is intended to preclude the carrying of any loaded firearm, under circumstances where it would otherwise be lawful, by a person who reasonably believes that any person or the property of any person is in immediate, grave danger and that the carrying of the weapon is necessary for the preservation of that person or property. (b) A violation of Section 25850 is justifiable when a person who possesses a firearm reasonably believes that person is in grave danger because of circumstances forming the basis of a current restraining order issued by a court against another person who has been found to pose a threat to the life or safety of the person who possesses the firearm. This subdivision may not apply when the circumstances involve a mutual restraining order issued pursuant to Division 10 (commencing with Section 6200) of the Family Code absent a factual finding of a specific threat to the person's life or safety. It is not the intent of the Legislature to limit, restrict, or narrow the application of current statutory or judicial authority to apply this or other justifications to a defendant charged with violating Section 25400 or committing another similar offense. Upon trial for violating Section 25850, the trier of fact shall determine whether the defendant was acting out of a reasonable belief that the defendant was in grave danger. (c) As used in this section, ""immediate"" means the brief interval before and after the local law enforcement agency, when reasonably possible, has been notified of the danger and before the arrival of its assistance.People v.

It was a miracle”Patient Holly DrewryHolly Drewry, 25, from Sheffield, was wheelchair bound after the birth of her daughter Isla, now two.But Miss Drewry claims the new treatment has transformed her life.She told the BBC’s Panorama programme: “I couldn’t walk steadily. I couldn’t trust myself holding her (Isla) in case I fell. Being a new mum I wanted to do it all properly but my MS was stopping me from doing it.“It is scary because you think, when is it going to end?” The treatment is being carried out at Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield and Kings College Hospital, London and involves use a high dose of chemotherapy to knock out the immune system before rebuilding it with stem cells taken from the patient’s own blood.Miss Drewry had the treatment in Sheffield. She said: “I started seeing changes within days of the stem cells being put in.“I walked out of the hospital. I walked into my house and hugged Isla. I cried and cried. It was a bit overwhelming. It was a miracle.”Her treatment has now been reviewed and her condition found to have been dramatically halted. She will need to be monitored for years but the hope is that her transplant will be a permanent fix.She is now planning to get married.For other patients, the results have been equally dramatic. Steven Storey was a marathon runner and triathlete before he was struck down with the disease and left completely paralysed: “I couldn’t flicker a muscle,” he said.But within nine days of the treatment he could move his toe and after 10 months managed a mile-long swim in the Lake District. He has also managed to ride a bike and walk again.“It was great. I felt I was back,” he said.Alastair Hignell: How I'm tackling MSMr Storey celebrated his first transplant birthday with his daughters. His treatment has been reviewed and, like Miss Drewry, there was no evidence of active disease.The treatment – which effectively ‘reboots’ the immune systems - is the first to reverse the symptoms of MS, which has no cure, and affects around 100,000 people in Britain.Stem cells are so effective because they can become any cell in the body based on their environment.""Since we started treating patients three years ago, some of the results we have seen have been miraculous""Professor Basil SharrackAlthough it is unclear what causes MS, some doctors believe that it is the immune system itself which attacks the brain and spinal cord, leading to inflammation and pain, disability and in severe cases, death.Professor Basil Sharrack, a consultant neurologist at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: ""Since we started treating patients three years ago, some of the results we have seen have been miraculous.""This is not a word I would use lightly, but we have seen profound neurological improvements.""During the treatment, the patient's stem cells are harvested and stored. Then doctors use aggressive drugs which are usually given to cancer patients to completely destroy the immune system.The harvested stem cells are then infused back into the body where they start to grow new red and white blood cells within just two weeks.Within a month the immune system is back up and running fully and that is when patients begin to notice that they are recovering.However specialists warn that patients need to be fit to benefit from the new treatment.The research has been published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.Panorama - Can you stop my multiple sclerosis? is on BBC1 at 8.30pm on Monday, January 18.Follow Telegraph News",2016/01/17,snopes,0

Most people in the industry today still feel this way. That’s one of the things that makes SEMA and its members unique.Today the organization performs many services for its members and for the hobby as a whole. Perhaps most importantly, SEMA works hard to protect consumers’ rights to drive accessorized, customized and vintage vehicles. SEMA keeps close tabs on legislators in Washington, D.C., and also in each state within the United States, so SEMA members and anyone who loves cars and trucks can protest pending legislation that might harm our hobby, as well as endorse legislation that’s good for car lovers. SEMA also has helped numerous consumers interact with car dealers, who sometimes try to get away with charging for repairs on a modified vehicle by claiming (wrongly) that specialty accessories have voided its warranty.Every year, SEMA also presents an enormous trade show in Las Vegas. This is where manufacturers unveil their latest offerings, while buyers, distributors and members of the press walk their feet off to see it all.

The Commission ruled that the Right to Farm Act protections no longer apply to many homeowners who keep small numbers of livestock.Kim White, who raises chickens and rabbits, said, They dont want us little guys feeding ourselves. They want us to go all to the big farms. They want to do away with small farms and I believe that is whats motivating it. The ruling will allow local governments to arbitrarily ban goats, chickens and beehives on any property where there are 13 homes within one eighth mile or a residence within 250 feet of the property, according to Michigan Public Radio. The Right to Farm Act was created in 1981 to protect farmers from the complaints of people from the city who moved to the country and then attempted to make it more urban with anti-farming ordinances. The new changes affect residents of rural Michigan too. It is not simply an urban or suburban concern.Shady Grove Farm in Gwinn, Michigan is the six and a half acre home to 150 egg-laying hens that provide eggs to a local co-op and a local restaurant. The small Michigan farm also homes sheep for wool and a few turkeys and meat chickens to provide fresh healthy, local poultry. We produce food with integrity, Randy Buchler told The Blaze about Shady Grove Farm. Everything we do here is 100 percent natural we like to say its beyond organic. We take a lot of pride and care in what were doing here. Shady Grove Farm was doing its part to bring healthy, local, organic food to the tables of Gwinn residents, and it mirrors the attitudes of hundreds of other small farming operations in Michigan and thousands of others popping up around the nation. The ruling comes within days of a report by The World Health Organization that stated the world is currently in grave danger of entering a post-antibiotic era. The WHOs director-general Dr. Margaret Chan argued that the antibiotic use in our industrialized food supply is the worst offender adding to the global crisis. The Michigan Agriculture Commission passed up an opportunity to support one of the hottest trends in food in Michigan public demand for access to more local, healthy, sustainable food, Gail Philbin told MLive.Meanwhile, neighboring Indiana Governor Mike Pence signed Senate Bill 179 a few weeks before which freed up poultry and egg sales from local and state regulation. Yesterday, the USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack announced massive funding to support research about small and medium-sized family farms, such as small farms ability to build-up local and regional economic systems. Theres a lot of unnecessary legal action being taken against small farms who are doing good things in their communities, said Randy Buchler, who is also on the board of directors for the Michigan Small Farm Council. The Michigan Small Farm Council actively fought to support Michigan farming freedom, but ultimately the Commission voted to approve the new restrictions.Farm Bureau has become another special interest beholden to big business and out of touch with small farmers, and constitutional and property rights of the little guy, Pine Hallow Farms wrote to the Michigan Small Farm Council. The Michigan Farm Bureau endorsed the new regulatory changes. Matthew Kapp, government relations specialist with Michigan Farm Bureau, told MLive that the members weighed in and felt that people raising livestock need to conform to local zoning ordinances. The Farm Bureau did not feel Michigans Right To Farm Act was meant to protect the smaller farms, and ultimately the Michigan Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development agreed.[Photo courtesy of City Chickens Gone Country]",2014/05/02,snopes,1

His book gives a first-hand account not only of the selection process that he endured, but the hectic, colorful, Astro-A-Go-Go world of Houston in the Sixties.He somehow resists the urge to turn his story into self-adulation, bully pulpit, or tedium; an urge that seemingly overpowered many of his fellow astronauts when they 'wrote' their own books. His 'reporter's eye' and droll wit is especially surprising in someone that is a military academy graduate, career officer (he retired with great distinction as a lieutenant general), and a trained engineer.Collin's description of the training and flight of Gemini 10 with 'Corned Beef' John Young is vivid and arresting. His narration of his space walk is so entrancing that it settled the question -- at least, for me -- what it was truly like 'up there'.Apollo 11, the Big Enchilada, is one of the book's finest segments. Collins gives readers such a sense of belonging to the mission themselves that it is irresistible. He describes the training in the simulators, the torture in the 'Vomit Comet' and the 'G-Wheel', and how it was to work with Armstrong and Aldrin. In this last, he is frank and candid. As he notes, it is difficult to have so many 'overachieving sons of overachievers' working together without some friction. He relates a small flare between the other two, after a 'crash' on the lunar surface during simulator training. This incident later appeared, nearly verbatim in the magnificent Tom Hanks 'From Earth to Moon' series.Collins also takes particular care to pay homage and respect to the most unappreciated and neglected of the astronaut's support system -- his wife, Patricia. By the way, he and Patricia are still married (to each other), for about a half century, having been married at Chambley, France, which happens to be where I was born. Although I doubt that the two events are related. At least, one hopes so.This book also has the advantage of giving color and life to other books about the space program, particularly Andrew Chaikin's wonderful 'A Man on the Moon: The Voyages of the Apollo Astronauts', and Gene Kranz's 'Failure Is Not An Option'.Collins has that most difficult-to-exercise gift of the writer -- what to leave on the cutting room floor. I always found myself feeling, as I do with a great actor, of wanting just a little more. He never over-explains, and his description, even of the most prosaic and mundane things, is terse, apt, and still vibrant and vivid. I believe that he could write a pilot's checklist and make it absorbing. This is one of the books that I buy in bulk, and give away. Not only is it a record of a fascinating time in history, but it is a fine example of how such a tale should be written.A small aside about the humor in the book; there is a footnote regarding radio procedures among fighter pilots that is simply one of the funniest things that I've ever read. How many footnotes have ever made you laugh aloud? I read the book (in one sitting, I might add, and yes -- it's that good) while occupying a booth next to a plate-glass window in a tavern during an afternoon of mixed thundershowers and blasting sunlight. When I read that particular bon mot, I roared, causing the other customers to stare and the waitress to bring me a glass of water and ask if I were all right.I also owe a personal debt to Michael Collins. My brilliant and beautiful wife, Diane, are getting ready to retire. When our financial adviser asked me to describe my goals for a perfect retirement, I thought for a moment, and paraphrased something that Collins had said in his magnificent book: ""Sitting on the porch in the evening, and talking to my wife.""",2012/04/29,snopes,0

Chief, Rejecting Agency’s Science, Chooses Not to Ban InsecticideImageScott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, on Tuesday. Mr. Pruitt rejected a petition filed a decade ago by two environmental groups asking that the agency ban all uses of chlorpyrifos.CreditCreditJim Watson/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesBy Eric LiptonMarch 29, 2017WASHINGTON — Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, moved late on Wednesday to reject the scientific conclusion of the agency’s own chemical safety experts who under the Obama administration recommended that one of the nation’s most widely used insecticides be permanently banned at farms nationwide because of the harm it potentially causes children and farm workers.The ruling by Mr. Pruitt , in one of his first formal actions as the nation’s top environmental official, rejected a petition filed a decade ago by two environmental groups that had asked that the agency ban all uses of chlorpyrifos. The chemical was banned in 2000 for use in most household settings , but still today is used at about 40,000 farms on about 50 different types of crops, ranging from almonds to apples.Late last year, and based in part on research conducted at Columbia University, E.P.A. scientists concluded that exposure to the chemical that has been in use since 1965 was potentially causing significant health consequences. They included learning and memory declines, particularly among farm workers and young children who may be exposed through drinking water and other sources.But Dow Chemical, which sells the product under the trade name Lorsban , along with farm groups that use it, had argued that the science demonstrating that chlorpyrifos caused such harm is inconclusive — especially when properly used to kill crop-spoiling insects.An E.P.A. scientific review panel made up of academic experts last July also had raised questions about some of the conclusions the chemical safety staff had reached. That led the staff to revise the way it had justified its findings of harm, although the agency employees as of late last year still concluded that the chemical should be banned.Mr. Pruitt, in an announcement issued Wednesday night , said the agency needed to study the science more.“We need to provide regulatory certainty to the thousands of American farms that rely on chlorpyrifos, while still protecting human health and the environment,” Mr. Pruitt said in his statement. “By reversing the previous administration’s steps to ban one of the most widely used pesticides in the world, we are returning to using sound science in decision-making — rather than predetermined results.”The United States Department of Agriculture, which works close with the nation’s farmers, supported Mr. Pruitt’s action.“It means that this important pest management tool will remain available to growers, helping to ensure an abundant and affordable food supply for this nation,” Sheryl Kunickis, director of the U.S.D.A. Office of Pest Management Policy, said in a statement Wednesday.Dow Agrosciences, the division that sells the product, also praised the ruling, calling it in a statement “the right decision for farmers who, in about 100 countries, rely on the effectiveness of chlorpyrifos to protect more than 50 crops.”But Jim Jones, who ran the chemical safety unit at the E.P.A. for five years, and spent more than 20 years working there until he left the agency in January when President Trump took office, said he was disappointed by Mr. Pruitt’s action.“They are ignoring the science that is pretty solid,” Mr. Jones said, adding that he believed the ruling would put farm workers and exposed children at unnecessary risk.The ruling is, in some ways, more consequential than the higher profile move by Mr. Trump on Tuesday to order the start of rolling back Obama administration rules related to coal-burning power plants and climate change.In rejecting the pesticide ban, Mr. Pruitt took what is known as a “final agency action” on the question of the safety and use of chlorpyrifos, suggesting that the matter would not likely be revisited until 2022, the next time the E.P.A. is formally required to re-evaluate the safety of the pesticide.Mr. Pruitt’s move was immediately condemned by environmental groups, which said it showed that the Trump administration cared more about catering to the demands of major corporate players, like Dow Chemical, than the health and safety of families nationwide.“We have a law that requires the E.P.A. to ban pesticides that it cannot determine are safe, and the E.P.A. has repeatedly said this pesticide is not safe,” said Patti Goldman, managing attorney at Earthjustice, a San Francisco-based environmental group that serves as the legal team for the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Pesticide Action Network of North America, which filed the petition in 2007 to ban the product.The agency had been under court order to issue a ruling on the petition by Friday. The environmental groups intend to return to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to ask judges to order the agency to “take action to protect children from this pesticide” Ms. Goldman said on Wednesday.Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated part of the name of an environmental advocacy group.

For decades, Target has collected vast amounts of data on every person who regularly walks into one of its stores. Whenever possible, Target assigns each shopper a unique code — known internally as the Guest ID number — that keeps tabs on everything they buy. “If you use a credit card or a coupon, or fill out a survey, or mail in a refund, or call the customer help line, or open an e-mail we’ve sent you or visit our Web site, we’ll record it and link it to your Guest ID,” Pole said. Also linked to your Guest ID is demographic information like your age, whether you are married and have kids, which part of town you live in, how long it takes you to drive to the store, your estimated salary, whether you’ve moved recently, what credit cards you carry in your wallet and what Web sites you visit. Target can buy data about your ethnicity, job history, the magazines you read, if you’ve ever declared bankruptcy or got divorced, the year you bought (or lost) your house, where you went to college, what kinds of topics you talk about online, whether you prefer certain brands of coffee, paper towels, cereal or applesauce, your political leanings, reading habits, charitable giving and the number of cars you own. (In a statement, Target declined to identify what demographic information it collects or purchases.) All that information is meaningless, however, without someone to analyze and make sense of it. That’s where Andrew Pole and the dozens of other members of Target’s Guest Marketing Analytics department come in. Almost every major retailer, from grocery chains to investmentbanks to the U.S. Postal Service, has a “predictive analytics” department devoted to understanding not just consumers’ shopping habits but also their personal habits, so as to more efficiently market to them. “But Target has always been one of the smartest at this,” says Eric Siegel, a consultant and the chairman of a conference called Predictive Analytics World. “We’re living through a golden age of behavioral research. The reason Target can snoop on our shopping habits is that, over the past two decades, the science of habit formation has become a major field of research in neurology and psychology departments at hundreds of major medical centers and universities, as well as inside extremely well financed corporate labs. “It’s like an arms race to hire statisticians nowadays,” said Andreas Weigend, the former chief scientist at Amazon.com. “Mathematicians are suddenly sexy.” As the ability to analyze data has grown more and more fine-grained, the push to understand how daily habits influence our decisions has become one of the most exciting topics in clinical research, even though most of us are hardly aware those patterns exist. One study from Duke University estimated that habits, rather than conscious decision-making, shape 45 percent of the choices we make every day, and recent discoveries have begun to change everything from the way we think about dieting to how doctors conceive treatments for anxiety, depression and addictions. This research is also transforming our understanding of how habits function across organizations and societies. A football coach named Tony Dungy propelled one of the worst teams in the N.F.L. to the Super Bowl by focusing on how his players habitually reacted to on-field cues. Before he became Treasury secretary, Paul O’Neill overhauled a stumbling conglomerate, Alcoa, and turned it into a top performer in the Dow Jones by relentlessly attacking one habit — a specific approach to worker safety — which in turn caused a companywide transformation. The Obama campaign has hired a habit specialist as its “chief scientist” to figure out how to trigger new voting patterns among different constituencies. Researchers have figured out how to stop people from habitually overeating and biting their nails. They can explain why some of us automatically go for a jog every morning and are more productive at work, while others oversleep and procrastinate. There is a calculus, it turns out, for mastering our subconscious urges. For companies like Target, the exhaustive rendering of our conscious and unconscious patterns into data sets and algorithms has revolutionized what they know about us and, therefore, how precisely they can sell. Inside the brain-and-cognitive-sciences department of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are what, to the casual observer, look like dollhouse versions of surgical theaters. There are rooms with tiny scalpels, small drills and miniature saws. Even the operating tables are petite, as if prepared for 7-year-old surgeons. Inside those shrunken O.R.’s, neurologists cut into the skulls of anesthetized rats, implanting tiny sensors that record the smallest changes in the activity of their brains. An M.I.T. neuroscientist named Ann Graybiel told me that she and her colleagues began exploring habits more than a decade ago by putting their wired rats into a T-shaped maze with chocolate at one end. The maze was structured so that each animal was positioned behind a barrier that opened after a loud click. The first time a rat was placed in the maze, it would usually wander slowly up and down the center aisle after the barrier slid away, sniffing in corners and scratching at walls. It appeared to smell the chocolate but couldn’t figure out how to find it. There was no discernible pattern in the rat’s meanderings and no indication it was working hard to find the treat. The probes in the rats’ heads, however, told a different story. While each animal wandered through the maze, its brain was working furiously. Every time a rat sniffed the air or scratched a wall, the neurosensors inside the animal’s head exploded with activity. As the scientists repeated the experiment, again and again, the rats eventually stopped sniffing corners and making wrong turns and began to zip through the maze with more and more speed. And within their brains, something unexpected occurred: as each rat learned how to complete the maze more quickly, its mental activity decreased. As the path became more and more automatic — as it became a habit — the rats started thinking less and less. This process, in which the brain converts a sequence of actions into an automatic routine, is called “chunking.” There are dozens, if not hundreds, of behavioral chunks we rely on every day. Some are simple: you automatically put toothpaste on your toothbrush before sticking it in your mouth. Some, like making the kids’ lunch, are a little more complex. Still others are so complicated that it’s remarkable to realize that a habit could have emerged at all. Take backing your car out of the driveway. When you first learned to drive, that act required a major dose of concentration, and for good reason: it involves peering into the rearview and side mirrors and checking for obstacles, putting your foot on the brake, moving the gearshift into reverse, removing your foot from the brake, estimating the distance between the garage and the street while keeping the wheels aligned, calculating how images in the mirrors translate into actual distances, all while applying differing amounts of pressure to the gas pedal and brake. Now, you perform that series of actions every time you pull into the street without thinking very much. Your brain has chunked large parts of it. Left to its own devices, the brain will try to make almost any repeated behavior into a habit, because habits allow our minds to conserve effort. But conserving mental energy is tricky, because if our brains power down at the wrong moment, we might fail to notice something important, like a child riding her bike down the sidewalk or a speeding car coming down the street. So we’ve devised a clever system to determine when to let a habit take over. It’s something that happens whenever a chunk of behavior starts or ends — and it helps to explain why habits are so difficult to change once they’re formed, despite our best intentions. To understand this a little more clearly, consider again the chocolate-seeking rats. What Graybiel and her colleagues found was that, as the ability to navigate the maze became habitual, there were two spikes in the rats’ brain activity — once at the beginning of the maze, when the rat heard the click right before the barrier slid away, and once at the end, when the rat found the chocolate. Those spikes show when the rats’ brains were fully engaged, and the dip in neural activity between the spikes showed when the habit took over. From behind the partition, the rat wasn’t sure what waited on the other side, until it heard the click, which it had come to associate with the maze. Once it heard that sound, it knew to use the “maze habit,” and its brain activity decreased. Then at the end of the routine, when the reward appeared, the brain shook itself awake again and the chocolate signaled to the rat that this particular habit was worth remembering, and the neurological pathway was carved that much deeper. The process within our brains that creates habits is a three-step loop. First, there is a cue, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use. Then there is the routine, which can be physical or mental or emotional. Finally, there is a reward, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future. Over time, this loop — cue, routine, reward; cue, routine, reward — becomes more and more automatic. The cue and reward become neurologically intertwined until a sense of craving emerges. What’s unique about cues and rewards, however, is how subtle they can be. Neurological studies like the ones in Graybiel’s lab have revealed that some cues span just milliseconds. And rewards can range from the obvious (like the sugar rush that a morning doughnut habit provides) to the infinitesimal (like the barely noticeable — but measurable — sense of relief the brain experiences after successfully navigating the driveway). Most cues and rewards, in fact, happen so quickly and are so slight that we are hardly aware of them at all. But our neural systems notice and use them to build automatic behaviors. Habits aren’t destiny — they can be ignored, changed or replaced. But it’s also true that once the loop is established and a habit emerges, your brain stops fully participating in decision-making. So unless you deliberately fight a habit — unless you find new cues and rewards — the old pattern will unfold automatically. “We’ve done experiments where we trained rats to run down a maze until it was a habit, and then we extinguished the habit by changing the placement of the reward,” Graybiel told me. “Then one day, we’ll put the reward in the old place and put in the rat and, by golly, the old habit will re-emerge right away. Luckily, simply understanding how habits work makes them easier to control. Take, for instance, a series of studies conducted a few years ago at Columbia University and the University of Alberta. Researchers wanted to understand how exercise habits emerge. In one project, 256 members of a health-insurance plan were invited to classes stressing the importance of exercise. Half the participants received an extra lesson on the theories of habit formation (the structure of the habit loop) and were asked to identify cues and rewards that might help them develop exercise routines. The results were dramatic. Over the next four months, those participants who deliberately identified cues and rewards spent twice as much time exercising as their peers. Other studies have yielded similar results. According to another recent paper, if you want to start running in the morning, it’s essential that you choose a simple cue (like always putting on your sneakers before breakfast or leaving your running clothes next to your bed) and a clear reward (like a midday treat or even the sense of accomplishment that comes from ritually recording your miles in a log book). After a while, your brain will start anticipating that reward — craving the treat or the feeling of accomplishment — and there will be a measurable neurological impulse to lace up your jogging shoes each morning. Our relationship to e-mail operates on the same principle. When a computer chimes or a smartphone vibrates with a new message, the brain starts anticipating the neurological “pleasure” (even if we don’t recognize it as such) that clicking on the e-mail and reading it provides. That expectation, if unsatisfied, can build until you find yourself moved to distraction by the thought of an e-mail sitting there unread — even if you know, rationally, it’s most likely not important. On the other hand, once you remove the cue by disabling the buzzing of your phone or the chiming of your computer, the craving is never triggered, and you’ll find, over time, that you’re able to work productively for long stretches without checking your in-box. Some of the most ambitious habit experiments have been conducted by corporate America. To understand why executives are so entranced by this science, consider how one of the world’s largest companies, Procter & Gamble, used habit insights to turn a failing product into one of its biggest sellers. P.& G. is the corporate behemoth behind a whole range of products, from Downy fabric softener to Bounty paper towels to Duracell batteries and dozens of other household brands. In the mid-1990s, P.& G.’s executives began a secret project to create a new product that could eradicate bad smells. P.& G. spent millions developing a colorless, cheap-to-manufacture liquid that could be sprayed on a smoky blouse, stinky couch, old jacket or stained car interior and make it odorless. In order to market the product — Febreze — the company formed a team that included a former Wall Street mathematician named Drake Stimson and habit specialists, whose job was to make sure the television commercials, which they tested in Phoenix, Salt Lake City and Boise, Idaho, accentuated the product’s cues and rewards just right. February 16, 2012 - In a preview of this Sunday's New York Times Magazine, Charles Duhigg details how some retailers profit by predicting major changes in your life. The first ad showed a woman complaining about the smoking section of a restaurant. Whenever she eats there, she says, her jacket smells like smoke. A friend tells her that if she uses Febreze, it will eliminate the odor. The cue in the ad is clear: the harsh smell of cigarette smoke. The reward: odor eliminated from clothes. The second ad featured a woman worrying about her dog, Sophie, who always sits on the couch. “Sophie will always smell like Sophie,” she says, but with Febreze, “now my furniture doesn’t have to.” The ads were put in heavy rotation. Then the marketers sat back, anticipating how they would spend their bonuses. A week passed. Then two. A month. Two months. Sales started small and got smaller. Febreze was a dud. The panicked marketing team canvassed consumers and conducted in-depth interviews to figure out what was going wrong, Stimson recalled. Their first inkling came when they visited a woman’s home outside Phoenix. The house was clean and organized. She was something of a neat freak, the woman explained. But when P.& G.’s scientists walked into her living room, where her nine cats spent most of their time, the scent was so overpowering that one of them gagged. “It’s usually not a problem,” she said. “No,” she said. “Isn’t it wonderful? A similar scene played out in dozens of other smelly homes. The reason Febreze wasn’t selling, the marketers realized, was that people couldn’t detect most of the bad smells in their lives. If you live with nine cats, you become desensitized to their scents. If you smoke cigarettes, eventually you don’t smell smoke anymore. Even the strongest odors fade with constant exposure. That’s why Febreze was a failure. The product’s cue — the bad smells that were supposed to trigger daily use — was hidden from the people who needed it the most. And Febreze’s reward (an odorless home) was meaningless to someone who couldn’t smell offensive scents in the first place. P.& G. employed a Harvard Business School professor to analyze Febreze’s ad campaigns. They collected hours of footage of people cleaning their homes and watched tape after tape, looking for clues that might help them connect Febreze to people’s daily habits. When that didn’t reveal anything, they went into the field and conducted more interviews. A breakthrough came when they visited a woman in a suburb near Scottsdale, Ariz., who was in her 40s with four children. Her house was clean, though not compulsively tidy, and didn’t appear to have any odor problems; there were no pets or smokers. To the surprise of everyone, she loved Febreze. “I use it every day,” she said. “What smells are you trying to get rid of?” a researcher asked. “I don’t really use it for specific smells,” the woman said. The researchers followed her around as she tidied the house. In the bedroom, she made her bed, tightened the sheet’s corners, then sprayed the comforter with Febreze. In the living room, she vacuumed, picked up the children’s shoes, straightened the coffee table, then sprayed Febreze on the freshly cleaned carpet. “It’s nice, you know?” she said. “Spraying feels like a little minicelebration when I’m done with a room.” At the rate she was going, the team estimated, she would empty a bottle of Febreze every two weeks. When they got back to P.& G.’s headquarters, the researchers watched their videotapes again. Now they knew what to look for and saw their mistake in scene after scene. Cleaning has its own habit loops that already exist. In one video, when a woman walked into a dirty room (cue), she started sweeping and picking up toys (routine), then she examined the room and smiled when she was done (reward). In another, a woman scowled at her unmade bed (cue), proceeded to straighten the blankets and comforter (routine) and then sighed as she ran her hands over the freshly plumped pillows (reward). P.& G. had been trying to create a whole new habit with Febreze, but what they really needed to do was piggyback on habit loops that were already in place. The marketers needed to position Febreze as something that came at the end of the cleaning ritual, the reward, rather than as a whole new cleaning routine. The company printed new ads showing open windows and gusts of fresh air. More perfume was added to the Febreze formula, so that instead of merely neutralizing odors, the spray had its own distinct scent. Television commercials were filmed of women, having finished their cleaning routine, using Febreze to spritz freshly made beds and just-laundered clothing. Each ad was designed to appeal to the habit loop: when you see a freshly cleaned room (cue), pull out Febreze (routine) and enjoy a smell that says you’ve done a great job (reward). When you finish making a bed (cue), spritz Febreze (routine) and breathe a sweet, contented sigh (reward). Febreze, the ads implied, was a pleasant treat, not a reminder that your home stinks. And so Febreze, a product originally conceived as a revolutionary way to destroy odors, became an air freshener used once things are already clean. The Febreze revamp occurred in the summer of 1998. Within two months, sales doubled. A year later, the product brought in $230 million. Since then Febreze has spawned dozens of spinoffs — air fresheners, candles and laundry detergents — that now account for sales of more than $1 billion a year. Eventually, P.& G. began mentioning to customers that, in addition to smelling sweet, Febreze can actually kill bad odors. Today it’s one of the top-selling products in the world. Andrew Pole was hired by Target to use the same kinds of insights into consumers’ habits to expand Target’s sales. His assignment was to analyze all the cue-routine-reward loops among shoppers and help the company figure out how to exploit them. Much of his department’s work was straightforward: find the customers who have children and send them catalogs that feature toys before Christmas. Look for shoppers who habitually purchase swimsuits in April and send them coupons for sunscreen in July and diet books in December. But Pole’s most important assignment was to identify those unique moments in consumers’ lives when their shopping habits become particularly flexible and the right advertisement or coupon would cause them to begin spending in new ways.

In the 1980s, a team of researchers led by a U.C.L.A. professor named Alan Andreasen undertook a study of peoples’ most mundane purchases, like soap, toothpaste, trash bags and toilet paper. They learned that most shoppers paid almost no attention to how they bought these products, that the purchases occurred habitually, without any complex decision-making. Which meant it was hard for marketers, despite their displays and coupons and product promotions, to persuade shoppers to change. But when some customers were going through a major life event, like graduating from college or getting a new job or moving to a new town, their shopping habits became flexible in ways that were both predictable and potential gold mines for retailers. The study found that when someone marries, he or she is more likely to start buying a new type of coffee. When a couple move into a new house, they’re more apt to purchase a different kind of cereal. When they divorce, there’s an increased chance they’ll start buying different brands of beer. Consumers going through major life events often don’t notice, or care, that their shopping habits have shifted, but retailers notice, and they care quite a bit. At those unique moments, Andreasen wrote, customers are “vulnerable to intervention by marketers.” In other words, a precisely timed advertisement, sent to a recent divorcee or new homebuyer, can change someone’s shopping patterns for years. And among life events, none are more important than the arrival of a baby. At that moment, new parents’ habits are more flexible than at almost any other time in their adult lives. If companies can identify pregnant shoppers, they can earn millions. The only problem is that identifying pregnant customers is harder than it sounds. Target has a baby-shower registry, and Pole started there, observing how shopping habits changed as a woman approached her due date, which women on the registry had willingly disclosed. He ran test after test, analyzing the data, and before long some useful patterns emerged. Lotions, for example. Lots of people buy lotion, but one of Pole’s colleagues noticed that women on the baby registry were buying larger quantities of unscented lotion around the beginning of their second trimester. Another analyst noted that sometime in the first 20 weeks, pregnant women loaded up on supplements like calcium, magnesium and zinc. Many shoppers purchase soap and cotton balls, but when someone suddenly starts buying lots of scent-free soap and extra-big bags of cotton balls, in addition to hand sanitizers and washcloths, it signals they could be getting close to their delivery date. As Pole’s computers crawled through the data, he was able to identify about 25 products that, when analyzed together, allowed him to assign each shopper a “pregnancy prediction” score. More important, he could also estimate her due date to within a small window, so Target could send coupons timed to very specific stages of her pregnancy. One Target employee I spoke to provided a hypothetical example. Take a fictional Target shopper named Jenny Ward, who is 23, lives in Atlanta and in March bought cocoa-butter lotion, a purse large enough to double as a diaper bag, zinc and magnesium supplements and a bright blue rug. There’s, say, an 87 percent chance that she’s pregnant and that her delivery date is sometime in late August. What’s more, because of the data attached to her Guest ID number, Target knows how to trigger Jenny’s habits. They know that if she receives a coupon via e-mail, it will most likely cue her to buy online. They know that if she receives an ad in the mail on Friday, she frequently uses it on a weekend trip to the store. And they know that if they reward her with a printed receipt that entitles her to a free cup of Starbucks coffee, she’ll use it when she comes back again. In the past, that knowledge had limited value. After all, Jenny purchased only cleaning supplies at Target, and there were only so many psychological buttons the company could push. But now that she is pregnant, everything is up for grabs. In addition to triggering Jenny’s habits to buy more cleaning products, they can also start including offers for an array of products, some more obvious than others, that a woman at her stage of pregnancy might need. Pole applied his program to every regular female shopper in Target’s national database and soon had a list of tens of thousands of women who were most likely pregnant. If they could entice those women or their husbands to visit Target and buy baby-related products, the company’s cue-routine-reward calculators could kick in and start pushing them to buy groceries, bathing suits, toys and clothing, as well. When Pole shared his list with the marketers, he said, they were ecstatic. Soon, Pole was getting invited to meetings above his paygrade. Eventually his paygrade went up. At which point someone asked an important question: How are women going to react when they figure out how much Target knows? “If we send someone a catalog and say, ‘Congratulations on your first child!’ and they’ve never told us they’re pregnant, that’s going to make some people uncomfortable,” Pole told me. “We are very conservative about compliance with all privacy laws. About a year after Pole created his pregnancy-prediction model, a man walked into a Target outside Minneapolis and demanded to see the manager. He was clutching coupons that had been sent to his daughter, and he was angry, according to an employee who participated in the conversation. Charles Duhigg explains the science of habits. “My daughter got this in the mail!” he said. “She’s still in high school, and you’re sending her coupons for baby clothes and cribs? The manager didn’t have any idea what the man was talking about. He looked at the mailer. Sure enough, it was addressed to the man’s daughter and contained advertisements for maternity clothing, nursery furniture and pictures of smiling infants. The manager apologized and then called a few days later to apologize again. On the phone, though, the father was somewhat abashed. “I had a talk with my daughter,” he said. “It turns out there’s been some activities in my house I haven’t been completely aware of. She’s due in August. When I approached Target to discuss Pole’s work, its representatives declined to speak with me. “Our mission is to make Target the preferred shopping destination for our guests by delivering outstanding value, continuous innovation and exceptional guest experience,” the company wrote in a statement. “We’ve developed a number of research tools that allow us to gain insights into trends and preferences within different demographic segments of our guest population.” When I sent Target a complete summary of my reporting, the reply was more terse: “Almost all of your statements contain inaccurate information and publishing them would be misleading to the public. We do not intend to address each statement point by point.” The company declined to identify what was inaccurate. When I offered to fly to Target’s headquarters to discuss its concerns, a spokeswoman e-mailed that no one would meet me. When I flew out anyway, I was told I was on a list of prohibited visitors. “I’ve been instructed not to give you access and to ask you to leave,” said a very nice security guard named Alex. Using data to predict a woman’s pregnancy, Target realized soon after Pole perfected his model, could be a public-relations disaster. So the question became: how could they get their advertisements into expectant mothers’ hands without making it appear they were spying on them? How do you take advantage of someone’s habits without letting them know you’re studying their lives? Before I met Andrew Pole, before I even decided to write a book about the science of habit formation, I had another goal: I wanted to lose weight. I had got into a bad habit of going to the cafeteria every afternoon and eating a chocolate-chip cookie, which contributed to my gaining a few pounds. Eight, to be precise. I put a Post-it note on my computer reading “NO MORE COOKIES.” But every afternoon, I managed to ignore that note, wander to the cafeteria, buy a cookie and eat it while chatting with colleagues. Tomorrow, I always promised myself, I’ll muster the willpower to resist. Tomorrow, I ate another cookie. When I started interviewing experts in habit formation, I concluded each interview by asking what I should do. The first step, they said, was to figure out my habit loop. The routine was simple: every afternoon, I walked to the cafeteria, bought a cookie and ate it while chatting with friends. Next came some less obvious questions: What was the cue? Hunger? Boredom? Low blood sugar? And what was the reward? The taste of the cookie itself? The temporary distraction from my work? The chance to socialize with colleagues? Rewards are powerful because they satisfy cravings, but we’re often not conscious of the urges driving our habits in the first place. So one day, when I felt a cookie impulse, I went outside and took a walk instead. The next day, I went to the cafeteria and bought a coffee. The next, I bought an apple and ate it while chatting with friends. You get the idea. I wanted to test different theories regarding what reward I was really craving. Was it hunger? (In which case the apple should have worked.) Was it the desire for a quick burst of energy? (If so, the coffee should suffice.) Or, as turned out to be the answer, was it that after several hours spent focused on work, I wanted to socialize, to make sure I was up to speed on office gossip, and the cookie was just a convenient excuse? When I walked to a colleague’s desk and chatted for a few minutes, it turned out, my cookie urge was gone. All that was left was identifying the cue. Deciphering cues is hard, however. Our lives often contain too much information to figure out what is triggering a particular behavior. Do you eat breakfast at a certain time because you’re hungry? Or because the morning news is on? Or because your kids have started eating? Experiments have shown that most cues fit into one of five categories: location, time, emotional state, other people or the immediately preceding action. Where are you? What time is it? What’s your emotional state? Who else is around? What action preceded the urge? The next day I did the same thing. And the next. Pretty soon, the cue was clear: I always felt an urge to snack around 3:30. Once I figured out all the parts of the loop, it seemed fairly easy to change my habit. But the psychologists and neuroscientists warned me that, for my new behavior to stick, I needed to abide by the same principle that guided Procter & Gamble in selling Febreze: To shift the routine — to socialize, rather than eat a cookie — I needed to piggyback on an existing habit. So now, every day around 3:30, I stand up, look around the newsroom for someone to talk to, spend 10 minutes gossiping, then go back to my desk. The cue and reward have stayed the same. Only the routine has shifted. It doesn’t feel like a decision, any more than the M.I.T. rats made a decision to run through the maze. It’s now a habit. I’ve lost 21 pounds since then (12 of them from changing my cookie ritual). After Andrew Pole built his pregnancy-prediction model, after he identified thousands of female shoppers who were most likely pregnant, after someone pointed out that some of those women might be a little upset if they received an advertisement making it obvious Target was studying their reproductive status, everyone decided to slow things down. The marketing department conducted a few tests by choosing a small, random sample of women from Pole’s list and mailing them combinations of advertisements to see how they reacted. “We have the capacity to send every customer an ad booklet, specifically designed for them, that says, ‘Here’s everything you bought last week and a coupon for it,’ ” one Target executive told me. “We do that for grocery products all the time.” But for pregnant women, Target’s goal was selling them baby items they didn’t even know they needed yet. “With the pregnancy products, though, we learned that some women react badly,” the executive said. “Then we started mixing in all these ads for things we knew pregnant women would never buy, so the baby ads looked random. We’d put an ad for a lawn mower next to diapers. We’d put a coupon for wineglasses next to infant clothes. That way, it looked like all the products were chosen by chance. “And we found out that as long as a pregnant woman thinks she hasn’t been spied on, she’ll use the coupons. She just assumes that everyone else on her block got the same mailer for diapers and cribs. In other words, if Target piggybacked on existing habits — the same cues and rewards they already knew got customers to buy cleaning supplies or socks — then they could insert a new routine: buying baby products, as well. There’s a cue (“Oh, a coupon for something I need!”) a routine (“Buy! Buy! Buy!”) and a reward (“I can take that off my list”). And once the shopper is inside the store, Target will hit her with cues and rewards to entice her to purchase everything she normally buys somewhere else. As long as Target camouflaged how much it knew, as long as the habit felt familiar, the new behavior took hold. Soon after the new ad campaign began, Target’s Mom and Baby sales exploded. The company doesn’t break out figures for specific divisions, but between 2002 — when Pole was hired — and 2010, Target’s revenues grew from $44 billion to $67 billion. Pole was promoted. He has been invited to speak at conferences. “I never expected this would become such a big deal,” he told me the last time we spoke. A few weeks before this article went to press, I flew to Minneapolis to try and speak to Andrew Pole one last time. I hadn’t talked to him in more than a year. Back when we were still friendly, I mentioned that my wife was seven months pregnant. We shop at Target, I told him, and had given the company our address so we could start receiving coupons in the mail. As my wife’s pregnancy progressed, I noticed a subtle upswing in the number of advertisements for diapers and baby clothes arriving at our house. Pole didn’t answer my e-mails or phone calls when I visited Minneapolis. I drove to his large home in a nice suburb, but no one answered the door. On my way back to the hotel, I stopped at a Target to pick up some deodorant, then also bought some T-shirts and a fancy hair gel. On a whim, I threw in some pacifiers, to see how the computers would react. Besides, our baby is now 9 months old. You can’t have too many pacifiers. When I paid, I didn’t receive any sudden deals on diapers or formula, to my slight disappointment. It made sense, though: I was shopping in a city I never previously visited, at 9:45 p.m. on a weeknight, buying a random assortment of items. I was using a corporate credit card, and besides the pacifiers, hadn’t purchased any of the things that a parent needs. It was clear to Target’s computers that I was on a business trip. Pole’s prediction calculator took one look at me, ran the numbers and decided to bide its time. Back home, the offers would eventually come. As Pole told me the last time we spoke: “Just wait.

If you did, you wouldn’t say that I live in a shithole country. You know how difficult you’ve made my job as a Peace Corps Volunteer. People constantly associate me with your actions and your hurtful words about the country and continent that they grew up in. I live in Uganda, so I can tell you first hand that this is one of the most beautiful countries that I have ever been to. IT IS NOT A SHITHOLE COUNTRY. I have also been to Rwanda, and I can tell you that it is incredible--filled with the most stunning views and amazing landscapes. NOT A SHITHOLE COUNTRY. The people who live in these two countries are kind, hardworking, dedicated, loving, and oh so welcoming. We would be lucky to have these people in America. I have been treated kinder and more like family in these two countries than I ever have been in America. I don’t understand how you can call these countries shithole countries when you have probably never been there and when America isn’t so perfect. Mr. President, I don’t think you have any right to call these countries shithole countries when you have probably never been there, and even if you have been there you still have no right to call them shithole countries.Mr. President, you know that America was founded on immigration, that the founded fathers came here to escape. Then there was Ellis Island where people could enter our country for a better life and in order to live the American dream. It really bothers me that you are so against immigration when all these people are trying to do is create a better life for themselves and their families. You also don’t know how your words affect people who have fallen in love with people from other countries and are trying to bring them into America to live and build a life. It makes it harder for those people to want to come to this country because of the hate that you constantly spread about them. It truly isn’t fair, because they have not done anything to you or this country. Honestly, figure your shit out before you call these countries shithole countries, because at this point their countries are far better than America.Mr. President please I am begging you stop making my job more difficult by the hate you spread about other countries. We Peace Corps Volunteers are trying our best to build communities and create families we can’t do that when people think our president hates them because sometimes they associate us with that hatred and they think that we also hate them, which is not true we love our host countries and think the world of the people that we have met.Last thing Mr. President, do us all a favor and go visit these countries. See for yourself that they are indeed not shithole countries, that they are FAR FAR FAR better than you think. If you spend just one day in these countries you would see what you were missing and your life and your heart would change and I think you might even develop kindness toward others.Now Mr. President, spread love not hate.Keep Reading",2018/01/21,snopes,0

Orwell's wife Eileen is seated to his left .Orwell was shot in the throat His wife helped him escape to France after the members of the POUM were arrested by the republicans . The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939In December 1936, Orwell went to Spain as a fighter for the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War that was provoked by Francisco Franco's Fascist uprising . He did not join the International Brigade as most leftist did , but the little known Marxist POUM .In conversation with Philip Mairet, editor of New English Weekly, Orwell said: 'This fascism ... somebody's got to stop it'.To Orwell, liberty and democracy went together, guaranteeing, among other things, the freedom of the artist; the present capitalist civilization was corrupt, but fascism would be morally calamitous.The POUM Barcelona 1937 Orwell in backJohn McNair (1887–1968), quotes him: 'He then said that this [writing a book] was quite secondary, and [that] his main reason for coming was to fight against Fascism'. Orwell went alone; his wife, Eileen, joined him later. He joined the Independent Labour Party contingent, which consisted of some twenty-five Britons who had joined the militia of the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM - Partido Obrero de Unificación Marxista), a revolutionary communist party. The POUM, and the radical wing of the anarcho-syndicalist CNT (Catalonia's dominant left-wing force), believed General Franco could be defeated only if the Republic's working class overthrew capitalism — a position at fundamental odds with the Spanish Communist Party, and its allies, which (backed by Soviet arms and aid) argued for a coalition with the bourgeois parties to defeat the fascist Nationalists. After July 1936 there was profound social revolution in Catalonia, Aragón, and wherever the CNT was strong, an egalitarian spirit sympathetically described in Homage to Catalonia. George Orwell - Spanish Civil War and TeaFortuitously, Orwell joined the POUM, rather than the Communist International Brigades, but his experiences — especially his and Eileen's narrow escape during a Communist purge in Barcelona in June 1937 — much increased his sympathies for the POUM, making him a life-long anti-Stalinist and firm believer in what he termed Democratic Socialism, socialism with free debate and free elections.In combat, Orwell was shot through the neck and nearly killed. At first, he feared his voice would be reduced to a permanent, painful whisper; this was not to be so, though the injury affected his voice, giving it ""a strange, compelling quietness"". He wrote in Homage to Catalonia that people frequently told him he was lucky to survive, but that he personally thought ""it would be even luckier not to be hit at all"".' People then had something we haven't got now. They didn't think of the future as something to be terrified of..' Coming up for AirGeorge and Eileen Orwell then lived in Morocco for half a year so he could recover from his wound. In that time, he wrote Coming Up for Air, his last novel before World War II. It is the most English of his novels; alarums of war mingle with images of idyllic Thames-side Edwardian childhood of protagonist George Bowling. The novel is pessimistic; industrialism and capitalism have killed the best of Old England, and there were great, new external threats. In homely terms, Bowling posits the totalitarian hypotheses of Borkenau, Orwell, Silone and Koestler: ""Old Hitler's something different. So's Joe Stalin. They aren't like these chaps in the old days who crucified people and chopped their heads off and so forth, just for the fun of it ... They're something quite new .""",2010/04/20,snopes,0

A long list of others are biding their time and assessing their chances.REPUBLICANS IN THE RACE Ben Carson Retired PhysicianAge: 63Religion: Seventh-day AdventistBase: Evangelicals Resume: Famous pediatric neurosurgeon, youngest person to head a major Johns Hopkins Hospital division. Created a charity that awards scholarships to children of good character.Education: B.A. Yale University. M.D. University of Michigan Medical School.Family: Married to Candy Carson (1975), with three adult sons. The Carsons live in Maryland with Ben's elderly mother Sonya, who was a seminal influence on his life and development. Claim to fame: Carson spoke at a National Prayer Breakfast in 2013, railing against political correctness and condemned Obamacare with President Obama sitting just a few feet away.Achilles heel: Carson is inflexibly conservative, opposing gay marriage and once saying gay attachments formed in prison provided evidence that sexual orientation is a choice. Carly Fiorina Former CEOAge: 60Religion: Episcopalian Base: Conservatives Resume: Former CEO of Hewett-Packard, former group president of Lucent Technologies, onetime US Senate candidate in CaliforniaEducation: B.A. Stanford University. UCLA School of Law (did not finish). M.B.A. University of Maryland. M.Sci. Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Family: Married to Frank Fiorina (1985), with two adult step-daughters. Divorced from Todd Bartlem (1977-1984).Claim to fame: Fiorina was the first woman to lead a Fortune 20 company, something that could provide key ammunition against the Democratic Partys' drive to make Hillary Clinton the first female president.Achilles heel: Fiorina's unceremonious firing by HP's board has led to questions about her management and leadership styles. And her only political experience has been a failed Senate bid in 2010 against Barbara Boxer. Mike Huckabee Former Arkansas governor Age: 59Religion: Southern BaptistBase: EvangelicalsResume: Former governor and lieutenant governor of Arkansas, former Fox News Channel host, ordained minister, authorEducation: B.A. Ouachita Baptist University.

He's known as an affable Christian and built a huge following on his weekend television program.Achilles heel: Huckabee may have a problem with female voters. He complained in 2014 about Obamacare's contraception coverage, saying Democrats want women to 'believe that they are helpless without Uncle Sugar.' And in 2015 he earned scorn for hawking herbal supplements in infomercials as a diabetes cure. Ted Cruz Texas senatorAge: 44Religion: Southern BaptistBase: Tea partiers Resume:US senator, Texas solicitor general, US Supreme Court clerk, associate deputy attorney general under President George W. BushEducation: B.A. Princeton University. J.D. Harvard Law School.Family: Married to Heidi Nelson Cruz (2001), with two young daughters.

Both Pauls have advocated for a brand of libertarianism that forces government to stop domestic surveillance programs and limits foreign interventions. Marco Rubio Florida senatorAge: 43Religion: Roman CatholicBase: Conservatives Resume: US senator, speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, city commissioner of West MiamiEducation: B.A. University of Florida. J.D. University of Miami School of Law.Family: Married to Jeanette Dousdebes (1998), with two sons and two daughters. Jeanette is a former Miami Dolphins cheerleader who posed for the squads first swimsuit calendar. Claim to fame: Rubio's personal story as the son of Cuban emigres is a powerful narrative, and helped him win his Senate seat in 2010 against a well-funded governor whom he initially trailed by 20 points.Achilles heel: Rubio was part of a bipartisan 'gang of eight' senators who crafted an Obama-approved immigration reform bill in 2013 which never became law a move that angered conservative Republicans. And he was criticized in 2011 for publicly telling a version of his parents' flight from Cuba that turned out to appear embellished. DEMOCRATS IN THE RACE Hillary Clinton Former sec. of stateAge: 67Religion: United Methodist Base: Liberals Resume: Secretary of state, US senator, US first lady, Arkansas first lady, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville law facultyEducation: B.A. Wellesley College. J.D. Yale Law School.Family: Clinton's husband Bill was the 42nd President of the United States.

And her performance surrounding the 2012 terror attack on a State Department facility in Benghazi, Libya, has been catnip for conservative Republicans. Bernie Sanders* Vermont senatorAge: 73Religion: JudaismBase: Far-left progressives Resume: US senator, US congressman, mayor of Burlington, Vermont Education: B.A. University of Chicago.Family: Sanders is married to Jane OMeara Sanders (1988), a former president of Burlington College. They have one child and three more from Mrs. Sanders' previous marriage. His brother Larry is a Green Party politician in the UK and formerly served on the Oxfordshire County Council.Claim to fame: Sanders is an unusually blunt, and unapologetic pol, happily promoting progressivism without hedging. He is also the longest-serving 'independent' member of Congress neither Democrat nor Republican.Achilles heel: Sanders describes himself as a 'democratic socialist.' At a time of huge GOP electoral gains, his far-left ideas don't poll well. He favors open borders, single-payer universal health insurance, and greater government control over media ownership.* Sanders will run as a Democrat but has no party affiliation in the Senate. REPUBLICANS IN THE HUNT Jeb Bush, former Florida governorBush has a father and a brother who occupied the Oval Office, and the capacity to raise massive amounts of campaign cash. He has alienated conservatives, though, by embracing immigration reform and 'Common Core' education standards.Chris Christie, New Jersey governorPugnacious and unapologetic, Christie would bring an ego-driven brashness to the race although his abrasive style and echos of his 'Bridgegate' scandal might ultimately sink him. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina senatorGraham was a non-factor until a March summit in Iowa where he stole the show and put himself on the map. Arizona Sen. John McCain has praised him as the best person to help right America's foreign-relations ship Bobby Jindal, Louisiana governorJindal's main claim to fame is his strident opposition to federal-level 'Common Core' education standards, which included a federal lawsuit that a judge dismissed in late March.John Kasich, Ohio governorKasich is a popular governor in the battleground Buckeye State, but has little name-recognition elsewhere. He has accommodated liberals on some issues and could be seen as a more palatable version of Jeb Bush for Republicans who are anxious about electing a family dynasty.DEMOCRATS IN THE HUNTJoe Biden, U.S. vice presidentBiden would be a natural candidate as the White House's sitting second-banana, but his reputation as a one-man gaffe factory will keep Democrats from taking him seriously. Jerry Brown, California governor Brown has been a presidential candidate three times and earned the nickname 'Moonbeam' for his liberal policy ideas.

Figure 8 a is a picture of the resulting solid in the original posture and its mirror image. The panels (b), (c) and (d) of this figure show the same object rotated around a vertical axis clockwise step by step in this order.Figure 9 is a shape of a car, and Figure 10 shows the object constructed from this shape. Figure 11 is a shape of a ship, and Figure 12 shows the object constructed from this shape. In both Figure 10 and Figure 12 , (a) is the original posture, and (b), (c), (d) are the results of rotation.From these examples, we can observe that the mirror image of an object appears to be the x-reversal mirror image instead of the y-reversal, not only in its original posture but also in its rotated versions. Thus, we achieve the anomalous mirror symmetry.6. Concluding RemarksWe introduced a new concept called “anomalous mirror symmetry”, which is not consistent with the law of optical physics, but which can be perceived subjectively because of optical illusion. We characterized this symmetry and constructed a method for designing the class of space curves and the associated cylindrical surfaces that create anomalous symmetry.The concept of anomalous symmetry we have introduced in this paper might be just one example of many possible new symmetries. The mirror symmetry with respect to a planar mirror is well studied from optical physics point of view. However, if we consider optical illusion, we may be able to extend the concept of mirror symmetry in many directions. The anomalous mirror symmetry introduced in this paper is such that the y-reversal image appears to be x-reversal. In general, for any pair of mirrors A and B, we might be able to define anomalous mirror symmetry in such a way that the mirror image with respect to the mirror A appears to be a mirror image with respect to the mirror B. To study those extensions is one of our future problems.AcknowledgmentsThe author expresses his sincere thanks to the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments, by which the author could improve the manuscript.

The email alleges that exposure to the ingredients in Swiffer Wet Jet caused a dog's death.The Swiffer Wet Jet system contains water (90-100%), propylene glycol n-propyl ether or propylene glycol n-butyl ether and isopropyl alcohol (1-4%). These ingredients are safe to use around pets when used according to label directions and would not cause liver damage at product concentrations. Propylene glycol n-butyl/propyl ether differs significantly from ethylene glycol, the potentially toxic ingredient present in most antifreeze products. Ethylene glycol is frequently implicated in causing renal failure in dogs following antifreeze ingestion. Propylene glycol n-propyl ether and propylene glycol n-butyl ether are very safe ingredients at levels used in cleaning products and do not cause kidney or liver failure.The ASPCA will continue to monitor this situation and will post any additional information as it becomes available. Please call 1-888-426-4435 if you have any questions or have a pet that you suspect is experiencing problems, or visit us at www.apcc.aspca.org .###For over 25 years, the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center has been the premier animal poison control center in North America. The center, an allied agency of the University of Illinois, is the only facility of its kind staffed by 25 veterinarians including five board-certified veterinary toxicologists and 10 certified veterinary technicians.

Friedrich Trump (1869-1918), a German-born barber who got rich providing lodging, food, and female companionship to Klondike gold miners, founded the family real estate empire in Queens, New York. Fred Trump (1905-99) took advantage of new government programs to build affordable urban housing and make lots of money for himself. Donald, born in 1946, was just as interested in being famous as in being wealthy. His first big coup, the Grand Hyatt hotel, opened in 1980, launching a decade of extravagant acquisitions (including two Atlantic City casinos and the Plaza Hotel) that made ""the Donald"" a byword for '80s excess. Blair conscientiously covers Donald's flamboyant personal life, from the womanizing through the stormy marriage to Ivana and the notorious romance with Marla Maples. Her sometimes portentous prose suits the pumped-up style of the man who promoted his projects by promoting himself with everything from a ghostwritten autobiography, The Art of the Deal, to a board game bearing his name. But the author's main interest, and her book's principal fascination, lies in tracing the evolution of American real estate development over the course of the 20th century, as bare-knuckled individual entrepreneurship gave way to business in partnership with government, which was in turn replaced by high-stakes financial manipulation using image to shape reality. Blair may well be right when she claims that the Trumps' saga constitutes ""a singular history of American capitalism itself."" This well-balanced, serious examination of the Trump family business proves its mettle by not mentioning The Donald's love life until it approaches page 300, and even then Blair is more concerned about Ivana's influence on Trump's business sense than on his hormones. While Donald is the star of Blair's work, his father and grandfather emerge as colorful characters in their own right. Arriving from Germany in 1885, Friedrich Trump spent a brief time in New York before striking out for Alaska, where he operated combined saloon-restaurant-brothels in several gold rush towns. When things went sour, Trump returned to New York, where he opened a modest real estate office in Queens that his son, Fred Jr., would greatly expand. Taking advantage of government programs designed to spur construction during the Depression, the middle Trump made his reputation by constructing well-built houses and apartments for the middle class. Following WWII, when the government was eager to find ways to ease the housing shortage, he used his contacts in city government to become a multimillionaire and one of the biggest landlords in Brooklyn and Queens. But his son wasn't interested in the boroughs; Donald used his father's money to make his fortune in Manhattan and then in Atlantic City. Blair documents the painstaking process whereby Trump transformed the Commodore Hotel to the Grand Hyatt and made his first mark in New York. With access to the Trump family and their business associates, Blair (bestselling author of Almost Gone) gives a first-rate, firsthand account of Donald Trump's rise, fall and resurrection as a business tycoon, while also exploring the motivation that drove him to risk it all to seek even more fame and fortune.

If consumers are actually eating meat dripping with blood no wonder they are being sickened with salmonella. Especially if it is ground meat. As far as meat products are concerned I saw a show last year of how wieners are processed and what goes into most of them. I could not believe the huge chunks of fat from the slaughter plants that goes into the vats. And this is perfectly OK with the government, after I saw that I only buy fat free wieners and I read labels. No wonder there is a epidemic of obesity in this country. If the chunks of fat is treated with this ammonia mixture that would be another reason not to buy this product and many others that use fat as a filler.Jared StrongAmmonia treated beef is a wonderful idea on the scale of fast food. Keeping down costs to allow for the dollar menu, or Mc Donalds promotional 35cent burgers was it a while back?, involves serving products traditionally destined for dog food. Why would a consumer expect a 5 star organic grass fed local steak from the dollar menu? Fast food has eliminated squirrel hunting because who is going to take the time to skin a squirrel when the dollar menu is there. The consumer gets what they pay for I’d personally enjoy having the option of safe ammonia treated meat when I’m in an economic position to consider such things rather than have to get a permit to hunt squirrels.Data DocSad to see people saying ammonia-treatment is for safety, when it is primarily to save money reusing tainted meat. Wake up people and contact a local farmer for meat – what you are buying in the grocery store is killing you. It’s loaded with chemicals, antibiotics, colorants and PCB’s. If you buy local, you get flavorful meat that actually tastes good, and it’s not going to poison you. get to know a REAL farmer today – not the kind of farmer who thinks ammonia is the normal way to preserve meat.japhy“If you don’t want bacteria in your food you have to treat it,” he added. “This is a good ingredient and a very effective intervention. It’s almost like something’s been taken out of the arsenal that shouldn’t have. And as a food safety guy, that bothers me.”A ‘good ingredient’. But why does it have to be used, again?“Beef Products Inc. uses an innovative process to turn fatty beef trimmings, which used to go mainly into pet food and other byproducts, into hamburger filler.”To the food industry: Don’t use crap materials in your product that require all that much more processing for something to be and taste edible. Don’t cut corners. And if it costs more? Well, you’re probably saving lives. Even if it is still, in the end, processed fast food, it’s at least a little closer to the source.JRTo the 4% – “good food” crowd: you continue to display your lack of understanding of both what actually occurs in food production or what needs to happen to feed the world. Here’s a good resource to broaden your perspective – http://plentytothinkabout.org/threerights/As a futher reminder to the organic/local crowd – this web site has repeatedly documented for you that neither local nor organic means safe.Really we don’t need this ammoniated beef and all this fast food!SteveJR’s reliance on a white paper espousing the merits of food technology (and the de-merits of organic/ecological agriculture) leaves a lot to be desired — such as truthful substantiation and a viewpoint that is free from blatant conflict of interest.The paper is put together by a major agribusiness technologist — Jeff Simmons president of Elanco, the animal health division of Eli Lilly and Company — with the same old, Only-Technology-Can-Feed-the-World argument…Problem is — it”s an un-truthful self-serving Agribusiness argument not based in fact. But they’ve repeated it often enough so that (some) people actually believe it…For a good look at the whole story go to a recent article in the Atlantic by Barry Estabrook (author of Tomatoland):http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/12/organic-can-feed-the-world/249348/“Given that the current food production system, which is really a 75-year-old experiment, leaves nearly one billion of the world’s seven billion humans seriously undernourished today, the onus should be on the advocates of agribusiness to prove their model can feed a future population of nine billion — not the other way around.”SaraThe fact is, the the “safety” of food depends on your definition of safe. If something is free of bacteria, but eating it causes diabetes, heart disease, and cancer, is it really safe? If something is full of bacteria and promotes immediate and long-term health, is it less “safe?”I don’t think people choose organic or local because it’s safer (though it may be), they choose it for arguably more important reasons, such as quality of nutrition, sustainability of the soil and food system, combating food giants and industrialization of food while supporting local economies and producers, and more.Besides, even if something is labelled “safe” by whomever claims to be qualifies to determine that, and it tastes crappy or is made of waste products, why is it even on the demoted dollar menu, really? Who wants to eat it, regardless of it’s impressive bacteria count? Why does feeding the world have to mean feeding it garbage?If we didn’t put our food at risk for pathogens during raising and processing – we wouldn’t need to add chemicals. Just a thought…BBListen, as long as you eat meat, there is going to be risk. Local and organic does not mean it’s safer. We all have a choice and can decide what to put in our bodies. I prefer food that is as natural as possible (unfefined) and produced without chemicals (poison). We have more power than you think. These huge corporations will produce what we demand because all they care about is money. Demand REAL food!!!!!Java GuyIf you haven’t watched “Food Inc”, take the time to do so. Then if you want to learn more watch: “Forks Over Knives,”. Read “Fast Food Nation”, “Every Twelve Seconds”, “Poisoned” Get educated, get outraged, then take action locally and globally. Change your grocery store habits, make thoughtful restaurant choices.Bottom Line is: Consumers have a choice, we do not have to play the victim to the big agro-conglomerates and fast food industry. Workers in these industries have rights as do we the final consumers.Robert GundelNow I’m even more afraid of fast food meat. If they are taking out the ingredient that makes it have LESS bacteria, are they going to find a way to keep more bacteria from being in it?I’d rather have my food with plenty of preservatives as well. I don’t understand why anyone would have a problem with irradiation either. Let them get sick once from e-coli and see how quick they change their mind. Everything is rosy until it’s YOU laying in the hospital or dead in a morgue.CarrieFrankly, there is an easy way to kill bacteria in meat. It’s called cooking.The article mentions this, but the link is broken. Pretty frightening to see how many additives/cleaning solutions, etc. can be used without being labeled at all:Eat local and buy local. Look your farmer in the eye and know that what they are selling you is the same food they feed to their families.sheilaWhy cant you just feed us real food…I will pay $4 for a real beef burger, as opposed to the 199 mcdonalds burger…just give me the option of knowing what Im buying and eating…it’s just nasty..I dont want to eat out ever again.KaseySIt was never said that the meat is tainted. It is a high probabilty that meat is tainted with E.coli O157:H7 along with Salmonella, etc. Since there is no way to ensure that each inch of every piece of meat is free of bacteria, there are interventions implemented as a hurdle to decrease the log growth.Buying local does not ensure that your meat is wholesome and safe. E. coli spp., Salmonella, Listeria spp., is in the enviornment.Cooking will work assuming that every consumer understands and actually takes into consideration that they can still get food poisoning if for whatever reason they undercooked, or didnt clean properly from raw meat to veggies and so on so forth.Finally, by removing such interventions which either reduce and/or eliminate bacteria, it makes the food system vulnerable. And then when the general public gets sick the gov’t agencies are under fire for not protecting the food system.Taylor WilkinsThe only reason we have E-coli problems is because our cows are being fed corn instead of grass. Corn makes their E-coli production speed up which then makes us sick if we eat it. Grass helps get ridof almost 80% of their E-coli which would leave u with a very healthy cow ready to eat. But the fact that companies dont like to spend money on grass seed or anyone to clean up the poop the cows stand in all day makes them sick. Thats like giving a human plastic. We would adapt o it over time but that only fixes obe problem and causes another. Im not saying dont eat meat. Im saying find out whats in it first and how that animal was raised. This way we wouldnt have any problems with E-coli break outs at allNorma S TerronesThank you for putting this on the “internet.” I am sick!!! I heard stories like this when my father worked for the meat packing industry back in the 50’s and 60’s. The least I can do is grind my own meat, like my mother would do. Or am I wishing on something that doesn’t exist when I buy my own cut of meat to grind??? Better yet AMERICANS SHOULD CUT MEAT OUT OF THEIR DIETS!!! Shame shame on our government for allowing this…bthechangeIt is incredible how people chose the better oil or gas for their lux cars, and for our bodies, they choose garbage… they are feeding their bodies with garbage and it is worst, they are educating the new generation with that idea… the idea of eating garbage because it taste good.

Despite the meal being notoriously known to be high in carbohydrates and fat but very low in protein, fiber, vitamins and minerals, it has somehow retained its global popularity,According to the World Instant Noodles Association (WINA), 52 countries consumed 97.7 billion servings last year alone. Among its highest consumers are China and Hong Kong, which together consumed 40.43 billion servings, followed by Indonesia, with 13.20 billion servings consumed. Unsurprisingly, the U.S. is not too far behind with 4 billion instant noodles consumed in 2015.But its reputation for being a “junk food,” actually gets worse.A Baylor University and Harvard study published in the Journal of Nutrition revealed that eating instant noodles may increase risks of heart disease and stroke, according to Washington Post .The researchers analyzed the health and diet of 11,000 South Koreans between ages 19 and 64. The study showed that South Korean women were at high risk of metabolic syndrome due to the large amounts of ramen they consume. Curiously, the result was not found on male participants, which the scientists attribute to biological differences between the genders.Metabolic syndrome often lead to increased blood sugar and blood pressure levels, causing a higher risk of diabetes, stroke or heart disease.The culprit identified was the substance found in ramen called Tertiary-butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ), a petroleum industry byproduct used to preserve cheap processed foods.“Although instant noodle is a convenient and delicious food, there could be an increased risk for metabolic syndrome given [the food’s] high sodium, unhealthy saturated fat and glycemic loads,” said Hyun Shin, Harvard School of Public Health doctoral candidate and co-author of the study.Separate studies conducted elsewhere have revealed other potential health hazards.In India, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) found lead contamination in Nestlé’s Maggi brand instant noodles containing 7 times the allowed limit. The agency immediately ordered banning of all nine approved variants of Maggi instant noodles in India, calling them “unsafe and hazardous for human consumption.”In South Korea, the Korea Food and Drug Administration (KFDA) found a cancer-causing substance known as Benzopyrene in six brands of noodles made by Nong Shim back in 2012. The discovery led to a massive recall of the products both local and abroad.Like it? Share with your friends!93",2016/07/04,snopes,1

On the grimiest corners of the rightwing internet, though, the restaurant has earned another reputation this election cycle: as the potential home base of a global Democratic sex ring.In what might be one of the strangest stories of the 2016 election, alt right Donald Trump supporters have become obsessed with a purported connection between the pizzeria and the Hillary Clinton campaign, with forum posters obsessing over everything from the restaurant's decor to its owners.""There are many strange coincidences surrounding it,"" one prominent Trump supporter, Twitter personality ""Pizza Party Ben,"" tells Washington City Paper about the pizzeria on Twitter.For Comet owner James Alefantis, the conspiracy theories about his restaurant are just another symptom of 2016.“The whole election has really just been insane,"" Alefantis says. Trump supporters on sites like Reddit and 4chan have long been looking for a stronger connection between Clinton and Jeffrey Epstein, a financial tycoon and sex offender whose plane Bill Clinton sometimes used. The Wikileaks release of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta's hacked emails inspired a feverish, and mostly hapless, search for salacious scandal evidence, while PolitiFact calls the evidence for a Clinton sex network ""ridiculously thin.""Late this week, Trump supporters on 4chan and Reddit began to focus on ""Pizzagate""— innocuous connections between Podesta and emails mentioning pizza that they claimed were far more sinister than they initially appeared.Why, they wondered, did Podesta have a handkerchief with a ""pizza-related"" map on it? And why did Podesta get so many emails about eating pizza?The answer to any reasonable person would be that Podesta eats pizza sometimes. Indeed, Alefantis says, ""pizza's always a big thing in politics.""To the alt right, though, ""pizza"" became a suspected code word for illegal sex trafficking. Pizza Party Ben, an associate of Breitbart provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos, writes in a Twitter message to WCP that Podesta's use of ""pizza"" is in ""weird cryptic language."" In one 2008 email released by Wikileaks, Alefantis thanked Podesta for attending a fundraiser at the restaurant but regretted not making him a pizza. That drew amateur theorists' attention to the restaurant's murals, which they declared ""creepy,"" and the sliding doors in front of the restaurant's bathrooms, dubbed "" hidden rooms .""Pizza Party Ben posted a lengthy Twitter thread urging readers to ""investigate"" the restaurant for themselves. One person even made a "" crazy wall "" map of the conspiracy, with Comet at its center.The conspiracies were fueled by the fact that Alefantis is the former romantic partner of David Brock, the longtime Democratic operative behind Media Matters and Correct the Record, a rapid-response outfit created to counter anti-Clinton theories on the internet. Given the nature of its operation, Correct the Record takes up an outsized space in the minds of righty conspiracy theorists.""Does anyone want to run surveillance on Comet Ping Pong?"" asked one Reddit user in a popular post on the Trump section of the site. ""Who the fuck do we tell in DC Police that would be competent?""It's not clear how much of the speculation is serious, how much is joking, and how much is just a desperate attempt to slime Clinton's campaign a few days before the election. But a Twitter user with a handle too vile to publish apparently went so far as to visit the restaurant, posting a picture he took from its interior and claiming that he had gone there and tried to open a locked door. ""Spooked,"" the user posted that he fled the restaurant. The conspiracy theorists weren't deterred by compatriots familiar with the pizzeria, who insisted that it's just a restaurant. ""Nothing satanic about it,"" wrote one 4chan user. For his part, Alefantis blames the bizarre theories around his restaurant on the presidential campaign.""It has everyone on edge and just doing bizarre things,"" he says.",2016/11/06,snopes,0

In November of 1994, five years out of office, doctors diagnosed him with Alzheimer’s disease. A new analysis suggests the signs may have been evident even before he left the White House.The findings hail from Arizona State University and are published in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease. They give credence to a method of disease detection that relies on analyzing speech patterns for irregularities, such as the repetition of certain phrases or forgetting them altogether. Alzheimer’s disease carries no reliable diagnostic tool, as scientists have yet to find a way to unlock the so far impenetrable black box of the brain.As a window into dementia, speech analysis can be tricky. Decades of recorded words aren’t usually lying around, waiting to be fed through a computer. But politicians, in their years of documented campaigning and national addresses, can act as a helpful outlier.In their analysis, Visar Berisha and Julie Liss, professors of speech and hearing science at ASU, compared Reagan’s transcripts to those of President George H.W. Bush. The two men acted as a reliable comparison for analyzing speech because they were around the same age during their presidency and served in the same decade. This proximity was important for Berisha and Liss because people speak differently across various time periods and at different stages in life.In parsing both presidents’ many transcripts, they discovered some key differences. Compared to Bush, who has exhibited no signs of dementia, Reagan began relying on crutch words more often toward the end of his presidency, such as using the word “thing” instead of a more specific term. He also repeated himself more often, the researchers found.Berisha and Liss got the idea for their study after coming across a study that analyzed autobiographical essays of nuns living in a convent, some of whom developed Alzheimer’s and tended to project the signs in their writing. “It was surprising that, by analyzing discourse rather than writing samples, similar changes were detectable over the course of two presidential terms,” Berisha told Yahoo .Cognitive decline is best caught early. It isn’t a gradual slide into senility so much as a push off of the edge of a cliff. Once the fall has begun, the amyloid plaques destroying neural connections quickly wipe away speech function and mental reasoning. Vocabulary size begins to shrink and known words elude people’s grasp. For Berisha and Liss, the hope is these kinds of detection methods can apply to the general public. They want to devise a study that can record conversations between physicians and patients to analyze speech patterns over time. They also want to study NFL press conferences among players who have suffered head trauma.“Our goal,” Berisha told Yahoo, “is that one day we can develop health applications that automatically analyze speech and language biomarkers for disease onset or progression.”Source: Berisha V, Wang S, LaCross A, Liss J.

Although orders of magnitude smaller in volume than rare caldera-forming supereruptions, these relatively frequent effusions of rhyolite are comparable to the largest eruptions of the 20th century, and pose a considerable volcanic hazard. However, the physical pathway from rejuvenation to eruption of silicic magma is unclear, particularly because the time between reheating of a subvolcanic intrusion and eruption is poorly quantified. This study uses nanometer-scale trace element diffusion in sanidine crystals to reveal that rejuvenation of a near-solidus or subsolidus silicic intrusion occurred in ∼10 mo or less following a protracted period (220 k.y.) of volcanic repose, and resulted in effusion of ∼3 km3 of high-silica rhyolite lava at the onset of Yellowstone’s last volcanic interval. The future renewal of effusive silicic volcanism at Yellowstone will likely require a comparable energetic intrusion of magma that remelts the shallow subvolcanic reservoir and generates eruptible rhyolite on month to annual time scales.REJUVENATION AND ERUPTION OF RHYOLITE LAVAS AT YELLOWSTONE CALDERAThermal rejuvenation of near-solidus magma reservoirs as a mechanism leading to silicic volcanic eruptions is implicated by cargoes of recycled crystals with inherited isotopic compositions ( Bindeman and Valley, 2001 , 2003 ) and multimodal age populations ( Charlier et al., 2005 ; Bacon and Lowenstern, 2005 ). Eruptible silicic magma may be produced by wholesale remelting of subsolidus intrusions ( Simakin and Bindeman, 2012 ) or periodic expunging of crystal-poor rhyolite from near-solidus but molten bodies of crystal-rich magma ( Charlier et al., 2005 ; Bachmann et al., 2014 ) that may persist for as much as hundreds of thousands of years ( Bachmann and Bergantz, 2004 ; Wotzlaw et al., 2013 ). Common to both silicic magma production paths is the trigger of thermal rejuvenation by intrusion of new hot magma. Despite numerous studies investigating the longevity of silicic magma bodies, the time scales associated with rejuvenating near-solidus or subsolidus intrusions at calderas with protracted histories of episodic volcanism and the subsequent thermochemical evolution leading to eruption remain poorly resolved.Effusion of rhyolite is the most frequent type of eruption within Yellowstone caldera (Wyoming, USA) and the most probable type of future volcanic eruption ( Christiansen et al., 2007 ; Girard and Stix, 2012 ). At least 23 distinct eruptions of rhyolite lava have occurred within Yellowstone since the caldera-forming eruption at 640 ka, largely distributed into three intervals of volcanism separated by tens to hundreds of thousands of years of repose ( Christiansen, 2001 ; Christiansen et al., 2007 ; Watts et al., 2012 ). The onset of these major intervals of intracaldera volcanism are marked by the eruption of rhyolite lavas ( Christiansen, 2001 ) with disequilibrium mineral assemblages and/or low 18O/16O compositions indicating thermal rejuvenation and cannibalization of subvolcanic intrusions that were altered by the caldera’s hydrothermal system during protracted volcanic repose ( Bindeman and Valley, 2001 ; Pritchard and Larson, 2012 ). The youngest interval of post-caldera volcanism ended an ∼220 k.y. period of volcanic quiescence by erupting ∼2–3 km3 of compositionally identical rhyolite to form the Scaup Lake (SCL) and South Biscuit Basin rhyolite lava flows at ca. 260 ka ( Christiansen et al., 2007 ; Girard and Stix, 2009 ). This study targets the SCL rhyolite because its mineralogic and petrologic characteristics reflect the most recent major thermal rejuvenation that led to the growth of a voluminous reservoir responsible for episodic eruptions of rhyolite lavas from ca. 170 to 75 ka ( Watts et al., 2012 ) (Fig. DR1 in the GSA Data Repository 1 ).The SCL rhyolite contains ∼30% phenocrysts of reversely zoned quartz, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, plagioclase, and sanidine with accessory zircon and Fe-Ti oxides. The rims of the phenocrysts indicate crystallization from hotter and less-evolved rhyolite melt ( Fig. 1 ; see the Data Repository), consistent with thermal rejuvenation of near-solidus or subsolidus intrusions followed by cooling and renewed crystallization ( Girard and Stix, 2009 ). For example, SCL plagioclase and sanidine phenocrysts have ubiquitous rims with sharp boundaries that truncate multiple interior domains ( Fig. 2 ). The rims are enriched in Ba, Sr, Ca, and in some cases Mg and Ti, relative to the adjacent grain interiors, consistent with final stage growth from a hotter rhyolite melt formed by injection of a less evolved magma or remelting of feldspar and mafic phases ( Bachmann et al., 2002 ). The ubiquity of this rim on SCL sanidine suggests that it represents a system-wide magmatic event. Two-feldspar thermometry using these plagioclase and sanidine rims yields temperatures of 819 ± 20 °C assuming a pressure of 3 kbar based on geophysical observations of the depth of the current magma reservoir ( Farrell et al., 2014 ), and quartz geobarometry ( Girard and Stix, 2012 ) (see the Data Repository).DIFFUSION OF ELEMENTAL ZONING IN SANIDINEWe employ diffusion modeling of fine-scale Ba, Sr, and Mg zoning across the inner boundaries of the high-temperature rims on SCL sanidine to constrain the timing of magma remobilization and rim growth relative to eruption for the most recent major rejuvenation of the Yellowstone reservoir. To effectively resolve short trace element profiles, we used a NanoSIMS 50L ion microprobe to measure concentration profiles with 0.3 μm spacing over ∼7 µm. The crystallographic orientations of the concentration profiles were measured via electron backscattered diffraction and used to determine the effective diffusivity for elements with anisotropic diffusion in sanidine. The measured concentration profiles were modeled with a misfit-minimization forward-modeling approach that utilizes an analytical solution to the diffusion equation appropriate for an abrupt change in composition far from the rim and/or where the diffusive distance is small, and a systematic brute-force method for model space searching (see the Data Repository).If a step function represents the initial concentration profile prior to diffusion, then Ba self-diffusion across the inner rim boundary indicates an elapsed time between crystallization of the rim and eruption of(n = 4 grains, 95% confidence) at 819 °C, whereas the Sr profiles indicate an elapsed time ofyr (n = 4 grains, 95% confidence) ( Fig. 3 ). Three of four Mg profiles are flat, consistent with faster diffusivity of Mg, with the other sanidine profile (grain 04-43) yielding an elapsed time ofyr at 819 °C (see the Data Repository). A critical observation is that the Ba, Sr, and Mg profiles have equivalent widths (4–7 μm) ( Fig. 2 ; see the Data Repository), a characteristic that rules out simple diffusion from an initial step function given their contrasting experimentally determined diffusivities (Table DR1; see footnote 1 ). If changes in the melt composition due to the resorption of feldspar and mafic minerals during remelting with or without mixing were not instantaneous compared to the time scale of rim growth, then the initial concentration profile would not be a step function. Instead, the initial concentration profile would resemble a relaxed diffusion profile but in fact represent a changing concentration of trace elements in the host melt during crystal growth ( Fig. 2 ). Given the mismatch between the calculated time scales for Ba, Sr, and Mg and the observation that their profile shapes are identical when scaled to the same relative concentration difference, we interpret that the chemical zoning recorded in the sanidine rims nearly entirely represents crystal growth from an evolving melt composition in the aftermath of rejuvenation with little to no subsequent diffusion. Therefore, the time scales calculated assuming a stepped initial condition for the individual Ba, Sr, and Mg profiles ( Fig. 3 ) significantly overestimate the time scale between crystal growth and eruption. Instead, the time interval between sanidine rim growth and eruption for all of the sanidine phenocrysts examined is constrained to <40 yr, which is the time required for the Sr concentration profile to diffusively diverge in shape and length from the Ba profile at the resolution of the NanoSIMS analyses. A decade is necessary for Mg to diffuse from the shape of the Ba concentration curve to the flat profiles recorded in 3 of the sanidine analyzed, so together these observations place an upper limit of ∼10–40 yr on the time scale between the start of rim growth and eruption for the SCL magma as a whole. For grain 04-43, which has a resolvable step in Mg concentration across the rim-core boundary, the diffusive time scale recorded by fast diffusing Mg refines the time interval to <0.8 yr or 10 mo, suggesting that this phenocryst records the final period of remobilization before eruption ( Fig. 3 ). These short durations between rejuvenation and eruption are consistent with crystal growth rates for feldspars in silicic magma based on experiments and natural samples (e.g., Swanson et al., 1989 ; Zellmer and Clavero, 2006 ). At appropriate degrees of undercooling, experimental crystallization rates (∼10−10 cm/s) predict ∼15 yr for growth of the entire sanidine rim (∼500 μm) and 1.5–3.5 mo for the growth of the 4–7 μm concentration gradients (see the Data Repository). Any time elapsed between sanidine dissolution in response to rejuvenation and the onset of renewed crystallization must be <∼1200 yr due to preservation of 18O/16O disequilibrium in the resorbed cores of SCL zircons ( Bindeman et al., 2008 ), but is likely much shorter because the entire population of SCL sanidine crystals would be consumed in only ∼30–45 yr within heated rhyolite given their rate of dissolution (see the Data Repository). Diffusion during SCL lava emplacement is likely to have been insignificant because silicic lavas are typically emplaced as a series of quickly quenched lobes (e.g., Tuffen et al., 2013 ).The renewed precipitation of sanidine at higher temperatures may reflect oversaturation triggered by magma ascent and concomitant exsolution of dissolved H2O in the SCL magma ( Almeev et al., 2012 ), addition of CO2 by new magma ( Wark et al., 2007 ), and/or relatively limited addition of K-Na–enriched melt derived from remelting of sanidine-rich cumulates ( Bachmann and Dungan, 2002 ). Reverse zoning in sanidine and other phases reflecting new crystallization after remobilization is recognized for other silicic magmas at calderas, such as the voluminous Fish Canyon Tuff ( Bachmann et al., 2002 ).The results of this study illustrate that the frequently made assumption in geospeedometry of a step-function initial condition can be inaccurate despite petrographic evidence for resorption, and can be addressed by interrogating diffusion time scale concordance between multiple trace elements that are geochemically similar. Other studies recognize the importance of alternate initial conditions for diffusion modeling ( Costa et al., 2008 ), including deconvolution of the effects of simultaneous crystal growth and diffusion of Ba and Sr in sanidine ( Chamberlain et al., 2014 ). By employing a third faster diffusing element (Mg), this study reveals that Ba and Sr profiles across the sanidine core-rim boundary reflect changes in melt composition rather than diffusive relaxation across a sharp boundary.MONTHS FOR REJUVENATION TO ERUPTIONThe high-spatial-resolution analyses of sanidine phenocrysts in this study indicate a time scale of only several months to dozens of months for rejuvenating silicic intrusive material at Yellowstone to produce its most frequent type of eruption after a protracted period of volcanic repose, during which the subvolcanic system existed as near-solidus or subsolidus state waiting for remobilization (e.g., Cooper and Kent, 2014 ). These brief time scales are remarkably similar to others calculated for eruption triggering, but in those cases due to magma mixing in established, liquid-dominated silicic magma chambers (10–60 yr, Matthews et al., 2012 ; ≤100 yr, Druitt et al., 2012 ). The recurring eruptions of rhyolite lava at Yellowstone caldera are individually comparable in size (∼1–10 km3) to recent silicic eruptions at Chaiten (Chile) or Pinatubo (Philippines), and would likely lead to considerable social and economic disruption and possible interference with North American air travel. If the ∼3 km3 volume for the SCL and South Biscuit Basin rhyolites is derived from a subvolcanic area outlined by their vent zones, then a ≥40–60-m-thick region of near-solidus or subsolidus rhyolite may have been remobilized. Recent physical modeling indicates that a near-solidus body of this size could be rejuvenated by an intrusion of hot, near-liquidus rhyolite within several years or less ( Simakin and Bindeman, 2012 ; Huber et al., 2012 ), consistent with our results. Today, Yellowstone’s vigorous hydrothermal system circulates through a several-kilometers-thick cap of subsolidus, fractured rhyolite above a shallow crustal reservoir (∼10,000 km3) of near-solidus magma mush containing 5%–32% or ∼200–600 km3 of rhyolitic melt ( Farrell et al., 2014 ) and a near-solidus lower crustal reservoir (∼46,000 km3) containing ∼2% or ∼900 km3 of basaltic partial melt ( Huang et al., 2015 ); both are ultimately sustained by intrusion of mafic magma at a rate similar to the active Hawaiian hotspot ( Lowenstern and Hurwitz, 2008 ). The results of this study reveal that a sufficiently energetic rejuvenation of Yellowstone’s shallow crystal-melt mush and/or hydrothermally altered wall rock could lead to an effusive eruption within months. Fortunately, any significant rejuvenation of the reservoir is likely to be associated with deformation or seismicity and identifiable by geophysical monitoring (e.g., Fialko et al., 2001 ; Wicks et al., 2006 ).This research benefitted from discussions with J. Lowenstern, C. Bacon, T. Sisson, R. Christiansen, H. Wright, N. Matthews, and S. Hurwitz at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and manuscript reviews by O. Bachmann, C. Barnes, K. Cooper, C.

They tested 25 air fresheners, laundry detergents, fabric softeners, dryer sheets, disinfectants, dish detergents, all-purpose cleaners, soaps, hand sanitizers, lotions, deodorants, and shampoos. Many of the products tested are top sellers in their category.A single fragrance in a product can contain a mixture of hundreds of chemicals, some of which (e.g., limonene, a citrus scent) react with ozone in ambient air to form dangerous secondary pollutants, including formaldehyde. 2 The researchers detected 133 different VOCs. Most commonly detected were limonene, α- and β-pinene (pine scents), and ethanol and acetone (often used as carriers for fragrance chemicals). 1Steinemann and colleagues found the average number of VOCs emitted was 17. 1 Each product emitted 1–8 toxic or hazardous chemicals, and close to half (44%) generated at least 1 of 24 carcinogenic hazardous air pollutants, such as acetaldehyde, 1,4-dioxane, formaldehyde, or methylene chloride. 1 These hazardous air pollutants have no safe exposure level, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 3 Of the 133 VOCs detected, only ethanol was listed on any label (for 2 products), and only ethanol and 2-butoxyethanol were listed on any Material Safety Data Sheet (for 5 products and 1 product, respectively). 1The Consumer Product Safety Commission, which regulates cleaning supplies, air fresheners, and laundry products, currently does not require manufacturers to disclose any ingredients on the label, including fragrances in these products. 4 The same is true for fragrances in personal care items, which are overseen by the Food and Drug Administration. 5 The Household Product Labeling Act, currently under review in the U.S. Senate, would require manufacturers to label consumer products with all ingredients, including fragrance mixtures. 6 “Disclosing all ingredients could be a first step to understanding potential toxicity and health effects,” says Steinemann.Although the authors did not seek to assess whether use of any of the products studied would be associated with any risk, 1 Steinemann says she receives hundreds of letters, phone calls, and e-mails from people who report a variety of respiratory, dermatological, and neurological problems they attribute to scented products: “Children have seizures after exposure to dryer sheets, and adults pass out around air fresheners,” she says. 7 Steinemann and colleague Stanley M. Caress have written elsewhere that 19% of respondents across two U.S. telephone surveys reported health problems they attributed to air fresheners, and nearly 11% reported irritation they attributed to scented laundry products vented outdoors. 8“It’s important to take people’s complaints seriously,” says Steinemann, because “these human experiences are helping to inform science.” One of her next projects will focus on biomarkers of exposure and effect to better understand how fragranced products may cause a range of adverse health effects. “The ultimate goal is to improve public health,” Steinemann says. For now, she recommends cleaning with basic supplies like vinegar and baking soda.Steinemann’s study “strongly suggests that we need to find unscented alternatives for cleaning our homes, laundry, and ourselves,” says Claudia Miller, an allergist and immunologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. An expert in chemical sensitivity, or toxicant-induced loss of tolerance, Miller created the Quick Environmental Exposure and Sensitivity Inventory, 9 a screening tool for chemical intolerance. According to Miller, products intended to keep homes smelling fresh can set people up for a lifetime of chemically induced illness, and repeated exposure to small amounts of household chemicals can trigger symptoms to previously tolerated chemicals. 10 “The best smell is no smell,” Miller says.​Open in a separate windowREFERENCES1.

Trump , who received draft deferments through much of the Vietnam War, told the author of a coming biography that he nevertheless “always felt that I was in the military” because of his education at a military-themed boarding school.Mr. Trump said his experience at the New York Military Academy, an expensive prep school where his parents had sent him to correct poor behavior, gave him “more training militarily than a lot of the guys that go into the military.”That claim may raise eyebrows given that Mr. Trump, now a Republican presidential candidate, never served in the military and mocked Senator John McCain of Arizona, a decorated naval aviator, for his captivity of several years during the Vietnam War.“He’s not a war hero,” Mr. Trump said in July. “He’s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured.”Mr. Trump described his education, business life, marriages and childhood in extensive interviews with Michael D’Antonio, a Pulitzer Prize-winning former reporter at Newsday. Mr. D’Antonio’s biography of Mr. Trump, “Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success,” will be published Sept. 22.In the book, Mr. Trump emerges as a man largely unchanged from his childhood in the wealthy Queens neighborhood of Jamaica Estates, where an exacting father, Fred Trump, schooled him in self-promotion and encouraged a lifetime of fighting. The senior Mr. Trump, a major real estate developer, counseled his son to “be a killer” and told him, “You are a king.”Mr. Trump memorably told Mr. D’Antonio that “when I look at myself in the first grade and I look at myself now, I’m basically the same.”ImageMr. Trump posing with a Sikorsky helicopter in Manhattan in 1988. Despite his flashy lifestyle, a biographer has found, he has displayed unexpected generosity.CreditWilbur Funches/Associated Press“The temperament is not that different,” he said.Mr. Trump’s preoccupation with winning — at anything and everything, big or small — dominated his youth. His mentor at the New York Military Academy, Theodore Dobias, called Mr. Trump “a conniver, even then.”When Mr. Trump’s high school classmates showed up for a Columbus Day parade in New York City, expecting to lead the procession, they were dismayed to find a group of Roman Catholic girls arranged ahead of them. Mr. Trump announced that he would take care of the problem. When he returned a few minutes later, having negotiated a Trump-like deal, the cadets were put at the front of the parade, Mr. Dobias said.Mr. Trump, he said, “just wanted to be first, in everything, and he wanted people to know he was first.”St. Martin’s Press provided an advance copy of the book to The New York Times, and Mr. D’Antonio provided excerpts from his interviews with Mr. Trump. (The author interviewed Mr. Trump for more than six hours. The sessions abruptly ended, he wrote, after Mr. Trump learned that Mr. D’Antonio had spoken with a longtime Trump enemy.)The biography offers candid and sometimes unflattering assessments of Mr. Trump by co-workers, friends, enemies and, most entertainingly, his former wives. “The little boy that still wants attention,” said Marla Maples, his second wife.“He wants to be noticed,” said Ivana Trump, wife No. 1, who recalled sending him into a fit of rage by skiing past him on a hill in Aspen, Colo. Mr. Trump stopped, took off his skis and walked off the trail. “He could not take it, that I could do something better than he did,” she said.Asked if she had ever figured out her ex-husband, Ivana Trump said, “Yeah, I figured it out.” But then she added, “Well, I really don’t know.”",2015/09/08,snopes,1

But the housekeeper lacked the security clearance to handle such material.In fact, Marina Santos was called on so frequently to receive emails that she may hold the secrets to emailgate if only the FBI and Congress would subpoena her and the equipment she used.Clinton entrusted far more than the care of her DC residence, known as Whitehaven, to Santos. She expected the Filipino immigrant to handle state secrets, further opening the Democratic presidential nominee to criticism that she played fast and loose with national security.Clinton would first receive highly sensitive emails from top aides at the State Department and then request that they, in turn, forward the messages and any attached documents to Santos to print out for her at the home.Among other things, Clinton requested that Santos print out drafts of her speeches, confidential memos and call sheets background information and talking points prepared for the secretary of state in advance of a phone call with a foreign head of state.Marina SantosRon SachsPls ask Marina to print for me in am, Clinton emailed top aide Huma Abedin regarding a redacted 2011 message marked sensitive but unclassified.In a classified 2012 email dealing with the new president of Malawi, another Clinton aide, Monica Hanley, advised Clinton, We can ask Marina to print this.Revisions to the Iran points was the subject line of a classified April 2012 email to Clinton from Hanley. In it, the text reads, Marina is trying to print for you.Both classified emails were marked confidential, the tier below secret or top secret.Santos also had access to a highly secure room called an SCIF (sensitive compartmented information facility) that diplomatic security agents set up at Whitehaven, according to FBI notes from an interview with Abedin.From within the SCIF, Santos who had no clearance collected documents from the secure facsimile machine for Clinton, the FBI notes revealed.Just how sensitive were the papers Santos presumably handled? The FBI noted Clinton periodically received the Presidential Daily Brief a top-secret document prepared by the CIA and other US intelligence agencies via the secure fax.A 2012 sensitive but unclassified email from Hanley to Clinton refers to a fax the staff wanted Clinton to see before your Netanyahu mtg. Marina will grab for you.Yet it appears Clinton was never asked by the FBI in its yearlong investigation to turn over the iMac that Santos used to receive the emails, or the printer she used to print out the documents, or the printouts themselves. see alsoHillary's 33,000 emails might not be 'missing' after all For months now, weve been told that Hillary Clintons 33,000... As The Post first reported, copies of Clintons 33,000 allegedly destroyed emails still exist in other locations and could be recovered if investigators were turned loose to seize them. Higher-ups at the Justice Department reportedly have blocked them from obtaining search warrants to obtain the evidence.It also appears the FBI did not formally interview Santos as a key witness in its investigation.This is a major oversight: Santos may know the whereabouts of a missing Apple MacBook laptop and USB flash drive that contain all of Clintons emails archived over her four years in office.In 2013, Hanley downloaded Clintons emails from her private server to the MacBook and flash drive.The two copies of the Clinton email archive (one on the archive laptop and one on the thumb drive) were intended to be stored in Clintons Chappaqua and Whitehaven residences, the FBI said in its case summary.But Hanley says the devices were lost, and the FBI says it does not have either item in its possession.In addition to Abedin, Santos worked closely with Hanley at Whitehaven and could shed light on the mystery if only she were asked about it.follow the storyRussians went after Hillary emails same day Trump called for hackTrump's trade policy, IG report lead to stock market jittersFBI employee blasted Trump voters: 'Uneducated, lazy POS'IG report finds FBI agents have cozy relationships with reporters'But my emails': Hillary Clinton trolls James ComeyClinton directed her maid to print out classified materialsSEE ALL STORIESWhen a Post reporter confronted Santos at her DC apartment Friday, she would say only, I dont speak to reporters.According to a 2010 profile in The Philippine Star, close Clinton friend Vernon Jordan recommended Santos to the Clintons after she worked part-time for him.Bill Clinton gave a speech in Manila as part of his foundation and took time to visit with the family of the mayordoma [housekeeper] of his Washington, DC, home Marina Santos.He was quoted as describing Santos as the wonderful woman who runs our home in Washington, without whom Hillary will not be able to serve as secretary of state. The article ended remarking, without a hint of irony: Marina now runs his house so that he and his wife can better serve interests higher than their own.Santos could turn out to be the Betty Currie of the Clinton email scandal. Currie was the secretary for President Clinton. She also came recommended by Jordan, and became famous as a central witness in the Monica Lewinsky scandal for her handling of gifts given to Clintons mistress.Investigators had sought the gifts, allegedly hidden under Curries bed on orders from Clinton, as evidence.The State Department and Clinton campaign did not respond to requests for comment.Paul Sperry, a former DC bureau chief for Investors Business Daily and a Hoover Institution media fellow, is the author of Infiltration.Share this:FacebookTwitterGoogleFacebook MessengerWhatsAppEmailCopy",2016/11/06,snopes,1

The species is called ermine especially during its winter white colour phase. The animal ’s pelt was used historically in royal robes in Europe , and the term ermine also refers to the animal’s white coat, sold in the fur trade.Widely distributed across northern North America and Eurasia, ermines are most abundant in thickets, woodlands, and semi-timbered areas. More than 35 subspecies are known. These slender, agile, voracious mammals measure 13 to 29 cm (5 to 12 inches) in head and body length, have a tail length of 5 to 12 cm (2 to 4.7 inches), and weigh less than 0.3 kg (0.7 pound). Females are smaller than males, and members of northern populations are smaller than their southern counterparts.ermine (Mustela erminea kaneii)The East Siberian ermine (Mustela erminea kaneii) of Kamchatka.© Mihailzhukov/Dreamstime.comErmines feed on small mammals, birds , eggs , frogs , and occasional invertebrates . Small prey is seized at the base of the skull , larger prey by the throat. The litter contains 3 to 13 young, born after a gestation prolonged as much as 10 months because of delayed implantation in the wall of the uterus .In summer the ermine is brown, with a whitish throat, chest, and belly. In colder climates the winter coat is white, except for the black tail tip. In moderately cold climates the fur becomes only partly white.The winter-taken pelts, prized for fineness and pure colour, are among the most valuable of commercial furs and are obtained mainly in northern Eurasia. During the reign of Edward III (1327–77) of England , the wearing of ermine was restricted to members of the royal family. Thereafter, state robes were constructed in such a way that in many cases the rank and position of the wearer could be determined by the presence or absence or disposition of the black spots.The International Union for Conservation of Nature has classified the ermine as a species of least concern. Although ermines face significant hunting and trapping pressure in small parts of their range, they are abundant animals whose global population faces no significant threat.",2015/07/21,snopes,0

John Cheves jcheves@herald-leader.comBill would let businesses refuse to serve gay customers for reasons of faithBy John ChevesFebruary 25, 2016 12:06 PMFrankfortA Senate committee approved two “religious liberty” bills Thursday, one to legally protect businesses that don’t want to serve gay, lesbian or transgender customers because of the owners’ religious objections, and the other to protect religious expression in public schools.The first measure, Senate Bill 180 , would prohibit the government from compelling services or actions from anyone if doing so conflicts with their sincerely held religious beliefs. The bill expands the state’s 2013 Religious Freedom Restoration Act to clarify that businesses could not be punished in such cases for violating local ordinances that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.Sen. Albert Robinson, R-London, the bill’s sponsor, said there are Christian-owned bakeries, florists and photographers in Kentucky that don’t want to assist with same-sex weddings. However, they also don’t want to face civil-rights lawsuits by spurned customers and punitive fines by local civil-rights agencies, Robinson said.“All of these business owners want to treat everyone with full human dignity and respect,” Robinson, R-London, told the Senate Committee on Veterans, Military Affairs and Public Protection. “But their consciences and religious beliefs prevent them from using their skills to promote a celebration that runs counter to what the Bible teaches about marriage. Shouldn’t their rights to freedom of speech and freedom of religion be respected?”FLASH SALE: Only 99� per monthSave on your first 3 months of digital access. Hurry! This offer won't last long.SAVE NOWRobinson said he’s also responding to the case of Hands On Originals, a Lexington business that refused to print T-shirts in 2012 for the Lexington Pride Festival, citing the owner’s religious objections.The Lexington Human Rights Commission found that Hands On Originals violated the city’s Fairness Ordinance requiring service to gays and lesbians. But Fayette Circuit Judge James Ishmael overturned that decision, ruling that there was no evidence the business refused the T-shirt order because of the sexuality of the would-be customers. Rather, the business objected to the shirt’s message “advocating sexual activity outside of a marriage between one man and one woman,” he wrote. The case is now on appeal.“There is an agenda at work here that seeks to force people with sincerely held religious convictions to either abandon these beliefs or violate them or face state action that could close their businesses and destroy them financially,” Robinson told his colleagues Thursday.As written, the bill would cover governments as well as businesses, limiting the power of public agencies to infringe on the “right of conscience” or “freedom of religion” of people who work for them.For instance, last July, a religious group threatened to sue the Kentucky Department of Juvenile Justice over its anti-bias policy to protect lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youths in state custody. The department asked a volunteer Baptist minister, David Wells, to stop working at its Bowling Green detention center because Wells would not agree to stop warning the youths about “the harms of homosexuality” as taught in the Bible.Tolerance can go too far, Stan Cave, an attorney for the Family Foundation of Kentucky, testified to the Senate committee on Thursday. Cave said he helped Robinson draft the bill.“Over the last 20 years, we’ve heard a lot of conversation about tolerance,” Cave said. “All of us want to be tolerant. But there comes a point where one person’s rights infringe with being tolerant of another person’s beliefs.”The committee voted 8 to 1 to approve SB 180 and send it to the Senate floor. Sen. Perry Clark, D-Louisville, cast the sole “no” vote, saying the state and federal constitutions already offer adequate protection for religious liberties. Four senators voted “pass,” citing the Hands On Originals case and saying the Senate traditionally doesn’t like to approve legislation that would affect lawsuits pending in the courts.After the hearing, a gay-rights advocate said Robinson’s bill is “an open attack” on Lexington, Louisville, Covington, Morehead, Frankfort, Danville, Midway and Vicco, which have ordinances that protect the civil rights of their lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender citizens.“It’s a clear attack on the eight cities that passed anti-discrimination fairness ordinances to protect LGBT people,” said Chris Hartman, director of the Louisville-based Fairness Campaign. “They made it crystal clear during the committee hearing that that’s what their aims are. So we’ll be doing everything we can to halt the progress of this legislation.”There will be a continued backlash in the General Assembly as some people are frightened by the progress the LGBT community is making legally and socially, Hartman said.“When folks lose ground, they attack more fiercely. That’s what we’re seeing here,” he said.If Robinson’s bill is passed by the Republican-led Senate, it will cross the Capitol to the Democratic-led House. On Thursday, House Speaker Greg Stumbo, D-Prestonsburg, said he hasn’t heard any of his members discuss the bill.“We’ll give it a full and fair hearing, I’m sure, as we do all Senate bills,” Stumbo said.Also Thursday, the same Senate committee unanimously approved Senate Bill 106 , sponsored by Sen. Brandon Smith, R-Hazard.SB 106 would require local school boards to permit “artistic or theatrical programs that advance students’ knowledge of society’s cultural and religious heritage and traditions, as well as provide opportunities for students to study and perform a wide range of cultural and religious music, literature, poetry and drama.”At issue: Linus, the beloved Peanuts comic strip character. In December, Johnson County school officials deleted a Bible passage that Linus recites from a student production of A Charlie Brown Christmas, despite local protests from people who wanted it included. During one performance, several adults in the audience loudly recited the lines on their own.Johnson County school superintendent Thomas Salyer sent a letter to the district’s principals Dec. 11 reminding them that federal courts have forbidden public school officials from encouraging or soliciting religious activity. Under the U.S. Constitution, citizens can express their religious beliefs, but government cannot give favorable treatment to a religion.“The U.S. Supreme Court and the 6th Circuit (U.S. Court of Appeals) are very clear that public school staff may not endorse any religion when acting in their official capacities and during school activities,” Salyer wrote in his letter.Senators at Thursday’s Senate committee hearing took issue with that idea. “Political correctness” has gotten so extreme in the United States that people can’t even say “Merry Christmas” without getting criticized, Smith told the Senate panel.“That seems to be the trend today, where everybody wants to be politically correct,” Smith said. “Any sort of language that has any sort of Christian handle to it anymore is unacceptable or is offensive to people.”Smith’s bill enjoyed strong bipartisan support.“As a Democrat, I gladly support your bill and I want to see it passed because I saw absolutely nothing wrong with that performance,” said Sen.

The second of five children, Rove was raised in Nevada by his mother and stepfather. It wasn't until Rove was a teenager that he found out that his stepfather--who at the time was leaving his mother after coming out as a homosexual--wasn't his biological father. Rove's mother died by suicide in 1981. Rove attended the University of Utah, the University of Texas at Austin and George Mason University, but he never graduated from college. As a student at the University of Utah, he became active in the College Republicans. Rove eventually put aside his academic career to focus on politics full time. He was special assistant to Republican National Committee Chairman George H.W. Bush from 1973 to 1974, served as executive director of the Fund for Limited Government from 1977 to 1978, and was deputy chief of staff to Texas Governor William Clements in 1981. From 1981 to 1999, he was president of Rove & Company, an Austin-based public affairs firm that worked for candidates, nonpartisan causes and nonprofit groups. During this time, he ran several successful election campaigns, including John Ashcroft's 1994 bid for the U.S. Senate, Bill Clement's 1986 race for Texas governor and Phil Gramm's 1982 and 1984 U.S. Senate elections. Rove helped guide George W. Bush to a win in the Texas gubernatorial election in 1994, then served as chief strategist for Bush's presidential campaigns in 2000 and 2004. He remained as a close advisor to the Bush White House, managing the Office of Political Affairs, the Office of Public Liaison, and the Office of Strategic Initiatives. Rove's name was linked to a couple of scandals during his tenure with the Bush administration, including the White House email incident relating to the dismissal of several U.S. attorneys and the conviction of former Democratic Governor of Alabama Don Siegelman. In 2006, Rove was under suspicion in a scandal that involved the leaking of the identity of CIA officer Valerie Plame. Though he was not charged with any crimes relating to these alleged activities, Rove gave up his domestic policy role in the administration in April 2006 and resigned from the White House in August 2007. During election night of the 2012 presidential race between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, Rove had an uncomfortable on-air exchange with Fox News by denying the network's acknowledgement of President Obama's re-election by way of his projected win in Ohio. Although Rove was taciturn on his public outburst, he has remained vocal about the Republican Party's need to attract Latinos and women into its demographic. Rove authored the book, The Triumph of William McKinley: Why the Election of 1896 Still Matters, in 2015. Rove was married to Houston socialite Valerie Mather Wainright from 1976 to 1980. He married graphic designer Darby Tara Hickson in 1986; the couple has a son, Andrew Madison Rove.",2011/11/29,snopes,0

She raced to her room and stuffed a pair of Barbie dolls, a tub of peanut butter and a toothbrush into a bag. She insisted on bringing boots for the long boat ride she imagined was coming.When her mother, Melissa, arrived home from her work as a human resources manager, Sofia ran into her arms and cried.""I want people to understand the impact that their words have on these children,"" said Melissa Yassini, who described the experience in a Facebook post that had been shared more than 21,000 times as of Monday. ""We often forget, we're waging war on one another with words, and we're adults. We can take it. The kids are suffering with this. They go to school every day and they're afraid to tell people they're Muslim. This has to stop."" Sad day in America when I have to comfort my 8 year old child who heard that someone with yellow hair named Trump wanted...Posted by Melissa Chance Yassini on Wednesday, December 9, 2015Anti-Muslim sentiment was building in the days before 14 people were killed Dec. 2 in the massacre at a disability center in Southern California by a Muslim couple investigators say were inspired at least in part by the Islamic State group. Some governors had already said they wouldn't allow Syrians fleeing civil war into their states because of extremist fears. Experts say Trump's call Dec. 7 to keep all Muslims from entering the United States -- a plan he said would apply only temporarily and to non-citizens -- only fanned the flames.Parents say their children hear disparaging remarks in their own communities, see hateful bumper stickers and T-shirts, and have had friends abandon them because of their faith.Ahad Khan, 12, came home from school in rural Westminster, Maryland, in tears because his best friend called him a future terrorist who couldn't be trusted, according to Ahad's father, Raza Khan.Khan, the chairman of the science department at Carroll Community College, shared Ahad's experience in an open letter to Trump on Facebook. As of Monday, it had been shared more than 4,300 times.""He is the engine right now for that fearmongering,"" Khan said in an interview. ""I don't think he realizes that his words matter. He doesn't realize the damaging effect his words can have on people, especially kids.""In the minds of children -- many long on imagination and short on political understanding -- phrases like ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims"" can be traumatic, experts say.""Children expect that society will be nurturing and protective,"" said Mark DeAntonio, a child psychiatry professor at the University of California Los Angeles. ""Statements implying detainment or exclusion for arbitrary reason like race ethnicity or religion create anxiety and trauma.""Some children have questioned their faith and place in American society.Kafumba Kromah, of Minneapolis, said his 8-year-old daughter asked him: ""Why we are Muslims? Why can't we be what everybody else is?"" His daughter encouraged him to cancel a trip to his native Liberia for fear he would be barred from returning.Mehnaz Mahmood, of Dallas, said her 7-year-old son urged her to switch to a black-and-white hijab -- so she would look more like a nun -- after they were subjected to anti-Muslim remarks outside his school this week.Sam Madi, of New Orleans, watched coverage of Trump's remarks with his 11-year-old son. He said he feared anti-Muslim sentiment would set back progress in integrating Muslims into American society. Zane Madi plays soccer and spends most weekends with his mother helping the city's homeless.""We're not prepared for this,"" said Madi, whose father fled Iraq in the 1970s. ""We're not prepared to sit and educate our children why they're not any different from anybody else. I don't think any parent is prepared for that. I don't care what religion you believe or don't believe.""Parents needn't shoulder the burden themselves, said Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor at UCLA. Teachers should talk about not generalizing Muslims and ask children to reinforce their friendships with Muslim students, she said in an email.As Khan, the father in Maryland, tucked his son in last week, he left him with the words he recited when he became a U.S. citizen two decades ago: ""One nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.""""I don't know why, I don't know how people forget that,"" Khan said later, fighting back tears. ""We have to; otherwise we're dividing ourselves.""I had no idea when I published Sofia's story on Facebook that her fears would reach over 20,000 people.

Richard Pan, D-Sacramento, drew the animus of parents who believe vaccines are unsafe and the law is an assault on parental rights. Pan received death threats at his office during the debate.After Gov. Jerry Brown signed Senate Bill 277, opponents turned to an attempt to recall Pan. Needing to gather 35,926 signatures by Dec. 31, they submitted none in Sacramento County or in Yolo County, which contain Pan’s 6th Senate District.“Not a single signature,” said Susan Patenaude-Vigil, Yolo County’s assistant clerk-recorder.FLASH SALE: Only $0.99 per monthSave on your first 3 months of digital access.

They also fell well short in seeking a referendum to overturn the law .A Sacramento-area organizer for the referendum campaign said the effort to overturn the law drew resources and time away from the Pan recall campaign.“By the time we were done with the referendum, we only had about three months left” to pursue the recall,” said Janine Kloss, who lives in Pan’s district. “The referendum interfered with that (recall) timeline.”Although Kloss’ name appears on the “Recall Pan” website, she said she had little involvement with the campaign. The proponent listed on campaign filing documents did not respond to multiple inquiries from The Sacramento Bee. The campaign’s ballot committee did not show any contributions.The anti-recall campaign, on the other hand, pulled in tens of thousands of dollars to defend Pan. Groups representing physicians, real estate interests, educators and organized labor contributed around $125,000 to the campaign, which unlike conventional races does not impose contribution limits.Beginning in July, schools will need to ensure that students entering kindergarten and seventh grade are up-to-date on all of their vaccines as a condition of enrollment.

''The fourth plane was hit by rocket fragments.''

''We turned out to be not bad teachers,'' a reserve colonel identified as G. Lyubinetsky said.

The American pilot was captured and asked to meet the soldiers who manned the battery that shot him from the sky. ''When he was told that it was Vietnamese, he did not believe it,'' the major said. As the Soviet technicians became more deeply involved, they even helped set up such ground-level lures as dummy villages to attract American planes into anti-aircraft ambush, according to the reminiscences. In one case, said Sergeant Kolesnik, three American Skyhawk fighter bombers were downed by such an ambush. ''This had an effect on the Americans,'' the sergeant said. ''Within two weeks they stopped all flights over the region.'' The report offered no overall summary of the numbers of Soviet technicians who became involved as combatants and casualties, nor the range and duration of their activities. One former soldier said that Soviet veterans of Vietnam annually gather on March 5 near Moscow to maintain contact with one another. Their pride was such in their Vietnam service that they made up small momentoes for themselves from the scrap of the 400th American plane that was downed in the war, the report said.

They're just rushing to catch the premiere of the highly anticipated ""Boy Meets World"" spinoff ""Girl Meets World"" on Disney Channel. Bringing back Cory, Topanga, and Mr. Fee-hee-heenay!, nostalgic TGIF lovers are stoked to see their favorite Friday night characters get new televised life again.But with the cast of ""Boy Meets World"" being welcomed onto DVR's once again, we couldn't help but wonder what other classic 90's sitcoms should be brought back to life, and in what capacity. So here is how we'd like to see classic TV sitcoms rebooted.SeinfeldOften ranked as the greatest television series of all time, ""Seinfeld's"" comedic methodology of nothing still attracts new fans every year. But with Julia Louis Dreyfus preoccupied with her political duties in ""Veep"" and Jerry Seinfeld cruising to viral video stardom in ""Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"" it might be better just to focus this reboot on either the characters of George Costanza or Cosmo Kramer. A series where George returns back to school to actually pursue his dream of being an architect while living with his parents would be a hit. But frankly, watching Cosmo Kramer inherit millions and launching a new branch of Kramerica in Silicon Valley might be ripe for more comedic potential.Home ImprovementThere was something so earnest and lovable about the loose screwed Tim Taylor navigating his family life and his hardware TV series every week. But now that all of his lads are grown up and likely with families of their own, you can't really inject him back into the family man role anymore. Viewers though would definitely identify with a recession prone Taylor, who after losing his television show is forced to work at Home Depot while trying to gain traction for his YouTube channel with the help of his wisecracking grandson.FrasierOne of the most successful spinoffs of all time, ""Frasier"" was smart and funny, injecting plenty of intellectual one-liners with witty storytelling that dominated NBC's ""Must See TV"" lineup. The series could come back with Frasier and Niles living in Chicago, opening up their own psychiatry office for the city's media, culture and athletic elite. Throw in a few appearances from the ole gang from ""Cheers"" and Frasier will be scrambling eggs and tossing salad again in no time.FriendsThe series got some short-lived spinoff life in ""Joey"" which lasted for two seasons. But a sitcom about Chandler and Monica's family life post ""Friends""-dom would incorporate the couple's dynamic chemistry which was often the highpoint on many ""Friends"" episodes. Add in Phoebe as a wayward roommate halfway through season one and you got a hit.The Fresh Prince of Bel-AirWill Smith plays Will Smith, who after making it big as a rapper takes in another disadvantaged, wise-cracking California youth to live with him in his luxury Philadelphian apartment. Add in a feisty little sister character played by Quvenzhan Wallis and audiences will be sure not to say smell ya later.Full HouseAfter the girls grow up and move out to college, Danny Tanner becomes depressed and lonely, questioning what to do with his life. So uncle Jesse invites Danny to be his business manager on his band's upcoming cross-country tour, with Uncle Joey serving as head roadie. They could even make a pit stop at Michelle Tanner's college in one episode, with the men initially embarrassing the young undergrad but then the family rejoicing in a warm embrace.Sabrina the Teenage WitchSabrina settles down into a quiet life as a bookshop owner in London while serving as single mother to her own bewitching female adolescent. But when her daughter's powers start to surface, they'll have to cast a big spell over London if they want to keep their Visas.Spin CityMichael J. Fox's character Mike Flaherty is inducted as Governor of New York after his predecessor and their entire staff step down due to scandal. Looking for a reliable team, Flaherty gets in touch with his old staff to help run the state, while Flaherty tries to maintain the state of his own family affairs in the process.Married... with ChildrenAfter looking forward to his retirement for years, the cranky Al Bundy becomes disenchanted without having anything to do all day. But after forming a bond with his daughter Kelly's lovable son, Bundy finds a new purpose in life as grandfather. Al and Peggy must adjust to being grandparents despite their penchant for inappropriate behavior. The title, you guessed it, is ""Married...With Grandchildren.""Related Topics:",2014/06/27,snopes,0

Use this natural trick to prevent stomach flu, even if you’ve been exposed! We’ve been doing this for six years and it has kept us healthy, even when we know we’ve been exposed to the stomach virus. It’s so easy, you’d be a fool not to try it! The stomach flu (not truly the “flu”) by nickname, stomach bug, norovirus, puking flu as my kids like to call it…whatever you call it, it’s NOT FUN. Use this simple, effective trick to prevent the stomach flu! If you need home remedies stomach flu has already hit your house perhaps? This works for anyone who is exposed to the stomach virus, but is not yet showing symptoms. We do this daily in our house. Don’t wait any longer order what you need now! Before you waste any more time run over and order everything you need to prevent the stomach virus daily. This is the best home remedies stomach flu post you’ll find and here are the products you need at the best prices. Plus you’ll save yourself a trip to the store where you will likely pick up more germs! These are the best prices on the products you need plus they’ll ship right to your door. Don’t wait any longer on ordering these. Use them year-round or during peak stomach virus season, it’s up to you! There is a little-known home remedy to prevent the stomach bug altogether. The trick here is PREVENTION! If you are already feeling symptoms of the stomach flu then this will NOT work. You need to do this BEFORE you get sick. However, if you have been EXPOSED to the stomach bug but aren’t showing symptoms yet then this is the trick you need to prevent yourself from getting sick. The best part? It’s natural and doesn’t involve anything containing chemicals. I am all for natural remedies! Okay, this is going to sound a little “out there” but I’ve tried it and believe me this works! On Monday my hubby came down with the stomach flu. He was puking and felt awful. I think heÂ had norovirus which is a highly contagious stomach flu.Â Norovirus has been going around and sure enough, a guy he works with had it right before him.Â Well, of course, he had eaten off my plate that day and I was so worried that the kids and I would all get it too. A friend of mine told me to start drinking grape juice to prevent me from getting sick. The kids and IÂ all started drinking grape juice and here we are 3 days later healthy and well! You may have landed on my page after searching “prevent stomach flu grape juice”. Well, I did some research as there wasn’t much info out there on this. It turns out there is some science behind this grape juice thing and I did a little research. In order to prevent yourself from getting the stomach flu after you know you have been exposed (taking care of a sick person, being around someone that was sick, etc) you need to start drinking 100% Grape Juice, no sugar added, right away BEFORE any symptoms appear. If you are having symptoms then it is too late for thisÂ home remedies stomach fluÂ trick and DO NOT drink the grape juice or you will be puking purple and it won’t be pretty! Drink the grape juice three times a day for a few days after being exposed. I have been drinking a juiceÂ glass full three times a day and filling the kids sippy cups full three times a day. Yes, this is a lot of sugar but I’d rather consume/give my kids sugar than have them get the stomach flu. The grape juice works by changing the pH in your intestinal tract soÂ that the virus can’t multiply. It also harbors various strong anti-viral chemicals in it. Along with the Vitamin C and anti-oxidants in the juice, it’s supposed to flush and kill the virus and/or severely lesson the symptoms. When you get a stomach virus, it actually isn’t in your stomach, it’s all in your large and small intestines. The effects of what it’s doing to those makes you sick to your stomach (changing the acidity in your stomach). Keeping the pH of the intestines slightly more alkaline is supposed to stop the virus from taking hold and thus making you sick. You can drink the grape juice alone or add in grapefruit seed extract for additional virus-killing benefits.Â NutriBioticÂŽ Maximum GSE Liquid Concentrate provides the highest available concentration of Citricidal brand grapefruit seed extract, a natural compound derived from the seed and pulp of grapefruit. The Citricidal seems to be the essential component in helping kill off any stomach virus in your system. I add 2-3 drops to the grape juice each time we drink it. Read the reviews on Amazon and see that this is also good for many, many other uses. It’s not only good for a home remedies stomach flu prevention trick, but so many other things too! So there is the science behindÂ this home remedies stomach flu prevention trick and I’mÂ the living experiment đ We are all healthy and have survived having the stomach flu going through our house! I love that grape juice tastes great and is something my kids will willingly drink. So next time you are around someone with the stomach flu start drinking grape juice! During peak cold and flu season we drink one glass of grape juice a day to prevent the stomach flu. If you know you’ve been exposed to it then up it to three times a day until a few days after the virus is gone from your home. Otherwise, drink a glass daily to prevent the stomach bug from infecting you and your family! In the summer we don’t drink it as we find the stomach bug rarely strikes in summertime.",2012/01/12,snopes,1

Oh, and beg for clear skies. This month’s so-called “Snow Moon” will pass through Earth’s outer shadow just after sunset, turning its face varying shades of grey. Lunar eclipses occur when the Earth is optimally placed between the sun and the moon. With an added dose of serendipity, we’re on our planet’s primo dark side with front-row seats. On the East Coast, the full moon climbs above the horizon around 5:30 p.m., just as it enters Earth’s penumbral (outer) shadow and — ever so slowly — the lunar disk will start to dim and turn gray. Late afternoon twilight gives way to the evening dark skies. For practical purposes, the Eastern time zone will likely perceive the gray shading around 6:14 p.m., according to Alan MacRobert and Kelly Beatty, senior editors at Sky & Telescope magazine. By the middle of the eclipse, at 7:44 p.m. Eastern time, the northern third of moon will be a noticeably darker gray, said astronomer Geoff Chester of the U.S. Naval Observatory. After mid-eclipse, the graying begins to yield to the moon’s normal brightness. The moon fully leaves the penumbral shadow at 9:55 p.m. But wait — there’s more! Let the kids stay up late, because Comet 45P/Honda-Mrkos-Pajdusáková (don’t ask us how to pronounce all those names) makes its closest approach to Earth Friday night. You’ll be able to see the greenish comet by telescope and binoculars in a dark location, but not with the naked eye. Depending on where you’re located, clouds may also prove to be a hindrance. A fairly large portion of the Northeast is forecast to be shrouded this evening, as well as the Great Lakes region and parts of the Southwest. Fortunately you can still watch, because the great folks at slooh.com will be webcasting the eclipse and the comet. And really, even if the skies were clear, that might be the best option if you want to see both events up-close. Slooh’s live feed from various locations begins at 5:30 p.m. with the lunar eclipse. Experts will weigh in with a play-by-play around 7:30 p.m. during the eclipse maximum. At 10:30 p.m. ET, Slooh will begin the comet show. Join astronomers Gerard Monteux and Bob Berman to learn about this seventh-magnitude (not visible with the naked eye) celestial object. For both live shows, send photos of the eclipse and comet to @Slooh on Twitter for a chance to be featured during the webcast. This eclipse is a little like deja vu. Yes, you’ve seen it before — eclipses are dictated by the Saros cycle, where 6,585.3 days slip in between eclipses, according to retired NASA eclipse expert, Fred Espenak. This eclipse series lasts 12 to 15 centuries. This eclipse is Saros 114. It has been around since the year 971 and it will last until June 22, 2233 (at 22:22:33 Universal Time!), according to NASA tables. The previous eclipse in this series occurred on Jan. 31, 1999, and before that, the eclipse occurred in the waning hours of Jimmy Carter’s presidency on Jan. 20, 1981. Facts do not lie, as the next lunar eclipse in this series is Feb. 22, 2035 — George Washington’s 303rd birthday.",2017/02/08,snopes,1

Based on these reports, CVM officials decided to investigate a plausible theory that the dogs were exposed to pentobarbital through dog food, and that this exposure was making them less responsive to pentobarbital when it was used as a drug.The investigation consisted of two parts. First, CVM had to determine if dog food could contain residues of the drug. Second, if residues were found, the Center had to determine what risk, if any, the residues posed to dogs.In conjunction with this investigation, the Center wanted to determine if pet food contained rendered remains of dogs and cats.How pentobarbital can get into dog foodBecause in addition to producing anesthesia, pentobarbital is routinely used to euthanize animals, the most likely way it could get into dog food would be in rendered animal products.Rendered products come from a process that converts animal tissues to feed ingredients. Pentobarbital seems to be able to survive the rendering process. If animals are euthanized with pentobarbital and subsequently rendered, pentobarbital could be present in the rendered feed ingredients.In order to determine if pentobarbital residues were present in animal feeds, CVM developed a sophisticated process to detect and quantify minute levels – down to 2 parts per billion of pentobarbital in dry dog food. To confirm that the methods they developed worked properly, CVM scientists used the methods to analyze dry commercial dog foods purchased from retail outlets near to their Laurel, MD, laboratories. The scientists purchased dog food as part of two surveys, one in 1998 and the second in 2000. They found some samples contained pentobarbital (see the attached tables).Dogs, cats not found in dog foodBecause pentobarbital is used to euthanize dogs and cats at animal shelters, finding pentobarbital in rendered feed ingredients could suggest that the pets were rendered and used in pet food.CVM scientists, as part of their investigation, developed a test to detect dog and cat DNA in the protein of the dog food. All samples from the most recent dog food survey (2000) that tested positive for pentobarbital, as well as a subset of samples that tested negative, were examined for the presence of remains derived from dogs or cats. The results demonstrated a complete absence of material that would have been derived from euthanized dogs or cats. The sensitivity of this method is 0.005% on a weight/weight basis; that is, the method can detect a minimum of 5 pounds of rendered remains in 50 tons of finished feed. Presently, it is assumed that the pentobarbital residues are entering pet foods from euthanized, rendered cattle or even horses.Finding levels of pentobarbital residues in dog foodUpon finding pentobarbital residues in dog food, the researchers undertook an assessment of the risk dogs might face. Dogs were given known quantities of pentobarbital for eight weeks to determine if consumption of small amounts of pentobarbital resulted in any physiological changes that could indicate potential effects on health. In short, the scientists wanted to find the level of pentobarbital dogs could be exposed to that would show no biological effects. The most sensitive indicator that pentobarbital had an effect is an increase in the production of certain enzymes collectively called cytochrome P450.Virtually all animals produce enzymes as a normal response to metabolize naturally occurring and man-made chemicals in their environment. Barbituates, such as pentobarbital, are especially efficient at causing the liver to produce these enzymes. In dogs, the most sensitive biological response to pentobarbital is an increase in the production of cytochrome P450 enzymes, which is why the scientists chose that as the best indicator of biological effect. If a low level of pentobarbital did not cause a dog to produce additional cytochrome P450 enzymes, then scientists could assume that the pentobarbital at that low level had no significant effect on the dog.In CVM’s study, experimental animals were each dosed orally with either 50, 150, or 500 micrograms pentobarbital/day for eight weeks. The results were compared with control animals, which were not exposed to pentobarbital.Several significant pentobarbital-associated effects were identified in this study:Dogs that received 150 and 500 micrograms pentobarbital once daily for eight weeks had statistically higher liver weights (relative to their bodyweights) than the animals in the control groups. Increased liver weights are associated with the increased production by the liver of cytochrome P450 enzymes;An analysis showed that the activity of at least three liver enzymes was statistically greater than that of the controls at doses of approximately 200 micrograms pentobarbital per day or greater.But researchers found no statistical differences in relative liver weight or liver enzyme activity between the group receiving 50 micrograms pentobarbital per day and the controls. Based on the data from this study, CVM scientists were able to determine that the no-observable-effect level – which is the highest dose at which no effects of treatment were found – for pentobarbital was 50 micrograms of pentobarbital per day.Adverse health effects unlikelyFor the purposes of CVM’s assessment the scientists assumed that at most, dogs would be exposed to no more than 4 micrograms/kilogram body weight/day based on the highest level of pentobarbital found in the survey of dog foods. In reality, dogs are not likely to consume that much. The high number was based on the assumption that the smallest dogs would eat dog food containing the greatest amount of pentobarbital detected in the survey of commercial pet foods-- 32 parts per billion.However, to get to the exposure level of 50 micrograms of pentobarbital per day, which is the highest level at which no biological response was seen, a dog would have to consume between 5 to 10 micrograms of pentobarbital per kilogram of body weight. But the most any dog would consume, based on the survey results, was 4 micrograms pentobarbital per kilogram of body weight per day.It should be emphasized that induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes is a normal response to many substances that are naturally found in foods. It is not an indication of harm, but was selected as the most sensitive indicator to detect any biological effect due to pentobarbital.Thus, the results of the assessment led CVM to conclude that it is highly unlikely a dog consuming dry dog food will experience any adverse effects from exposures to the low levels of pentobarbital found in CVM’s dog food surveys.More in CVM FOIA Electronic Reading RoomPage Last Updated: 11/21/2017",2011/11/24,snopes,0

Added fellow Rogue One scribe Gary Whitta, ""Opposed by a multicultural group led by brave women."" Both men changed their avatars to a Rebel insignia with a safety pin, a reference to the symbol of solidarity with persecuted groups that has spread following the election.Responses offered a predictable split between cheers for the activism and jeers toward Hollywood liberals. What Disney and Lucasfilm might not be thrilled about is that a Trump ""Empire"" versus Hillary Clinton ""Resistance"" narrative might alienate the 61 million-plus voters who backed the real estate mogul - a group too large to ignore when a company is in the tentpole business. By wading into polarizing waters, might the Rogue One writers hurt its box office? That's a question being asked all over Hollywood.""When you're trying to get a big movie out, you want to be as agnostic as possible. You want to be able to appeal to everyone irrespective of their political beliefs,"" says comScore analyst Paul Dergarabedian. ""If it's a Michael Moore movie, go for it. Or Dinesh D'Souza. Then your currency is controversy. But if you're producing something for the masses, your currency is not controversy. It's get the movie out to the broadest possible audience.""Read more: 'Rogue One' Video Offers Closer Look at Its Grit, Grime and BeautyThe ensuing backlash caused Weitz to respond: ""Wow. The trolling is getting pretty heavy."" Within 24 hours, both writers took down the tweets and Weitz apologized. But the damage was done. (Disney declined comment.)In the Trump Age, if the right-leaning media can help tip a presidential election, it's reasonable to assume it can impact grosses. Just ask the makers of the all-female Ghostbusters, which was attacked online , prompting director Paul Feig and the studio to engage in the name-calling. The tentpole had been turned into a social hot potato before eventually disappointing at the box office.""It comes down to how it is perceived. If Bill O'Reilly, Drudge and Breitbart collectively decide to take this on as this year's version of the war on Christmas, it can have an impact,"" says Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group. ""Any time someone treads down a political path, there is commercial risk.""The Rogue One writers aren't alone in politicizing an upcoming tentpole. J.K. Rowling was less strident but perhaps offended a broader audience when she credited the ""rise in populism around the world,"" which she dubbed ""a very dark force,"" as providing inspiration for Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Though Warner Bros. doesn't believe her comments hurt Fantastic Beasts, the message to Trump and Brexit voters might be their movements are at odds with the film (as opposed to just Rowling's politics).Read more: 'Rogue One' Writers Subtly Protest Trump With Rebellion Safety-Pin Logo""With any business, it's better to leave politics out of a product you're trying to sell to consumers,"" says Drexel Hamilton analyst Tony Wible. ""You have to separate your product from personal opinions.

If Weitz had tweeted a similar sentiment like: ""The Empire is an authoritarian state led by Xi Jinping,"" he would have been committing box-office suicide.""You will never see Richard Gere cast in a Marvel movie or a major tentpole,"" notes one producer of the actor, whose denouncement of the Chinese government for its treatment of Tibetans still reverberates more two decades later.After all, in an industry that places nine-figure bets on tentpoles, there's little room for offending anyone.""We're talking about a lot at stake,"" Dergarabedian adds.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/emmanuel-macron-us-liberals-refugee-status-france/,emmanuel macron offered american liberals refugee status in france,False,"['emmanuel macron', ' france']",https://www.loc.gov/,https://www.loc.gov/law/help/refugee-law/france.php,2017/06/05,"A. Right to Stay1. ResidencyThe first, and perhaps most obvious, benefit of asylum is the legal right to reside in France. Refugees gain the right to a residency permit, which is valid for an initial term of ten years and can then be renewed for an indefinite term. [20] Beneficiaries of subsidiary protection gain the right to a temporary stay permit, valid for an initial term of one year and renewable for subsequent two-year terms. [21] Both the residency permit and the temporary stay permit authorize the holder to work in France. [22]The spouse and children of a refugee or beneficiary of subsidiary protection may reside in France with him/her. [23] However, this right may be denied to a relative whose presence in France would present a threat to public order, or who is found to have participated in the persecutions that caused the asylum request, or if the applicant does not follow the basic principles of family life in France (such as monogamy, for example). [24]2. Obtaining French CitizenshipFurthermore, being a refugee greatly shortens the naturalization process, should the person wish to obtain French citizenship. Whereas the normal requirements for naturalization include (among other criteria) that the applicant have resided in France for at least the previous five years, [25] a person officially recognized as a refugee by the French government may apply for naturalization immediately. [26] All the other requirements (such as being of good moral conduct and character; having no criminal record; demonstrating that he/she is integrated into French society; and that he/she has sufficient knowledge of the French language, history, culture, and values) [27] appear to generally apply, however, except that a further simplification is provided for elderly refugees. Political refugees and stateless persons who are over seventy years of age and who have resided in France for at least fifteen years may be naturalized without having to demonstrate knowledge of the French language. [28] The normal rules of naturalization apply to beneficiaries of subsidiary protection, but unlike refugees, they are not exempt from the five-year residency requirement.B. Travel DocumentsA refugee or beneficiary of subsidiary protection may obtain travel documents from the French government, unless there is a strong reason related to national security or public order for the government to withhold such travel documents. [29] These travel documents allow the person to travel outside of France (in a manner similar to a passport), and are valid for two years for a refugee, and one year for a beneficiary of subsidiary protection. [30] An important limitation to these travel documents is that they do not authorize a refugee or beneficiary of subsidiary protection to return to his/her country of origin or any other country where he/she may suffer the persecution or danger that justified asylum in France. [31] However, a refugee or beneficiary of subsidiary protection may request a three-month safe conduct pass to travel to his/her country of origin when it is justified by very rare circumstances such as the death or serious illness of a close relative. [32]C. AssimilationLike other immigrants upon their first arrival in France, refugees and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection are required to sign an “accommodation and integration contract” (contrat d’accueil et d’intégration) with the French government, by which they commit to respect the fundamental values of the French Republic and to attend a civic training program, an information session on life in France, and, if necessary, language classes. [33] The civic training program is a one-day session about French political and administrative institutions as well as French social values such as gender equality, secularism, and compulsory and free access to education. [34] The information session about life in France is meant to “inform newly arrived migrants of the formalities of everyday life.” [35] This “contract” also gives access to individualized help to determine the person’s professional competencies and potential, and to develop a strategy to find employment. [36]D. Social Benefits1. Refugees and Beneficiaries of Subsidiary Protection Eligible for the Same Social Benefits as French CitizensRefugees and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection have similar rights to social benefits as French citizens. [37] They are covered by the French universal health insurance scheme, for example, and they may get various social welfare benefits (guaranteed minimum income, family subsidies, access to social housing, etc.) under the same conditions as French citizens. [38] 2. Special Programs for Asylum Seekersa. Temporary Housing AssistanceAsylum seekers also benefit from certain welfare programs that target them specifically, in order to facilitate their settlement into French society. Specifically, asylum seekers may reside in special temporary housing facilities called centres d’accueil pour demandeurs d’asile (CADA, centers for the reception of asylum seekers) while their asylum applications are being processed. [39] These facilities are usually managed at the local level by nonprofit organizations or by semipublic companies (sociétés d’économie mixte). [40] If an asylum seeker’s application is approved, thereby granting him/her the status of refugee or beneficiary of subsidiary protection, he/she may stay in his/her CADA for up to six months while he/she seeks a more permanent housing arrangement. [41] Like many other European countries, France has seen a surge in incoming refugees over the last couple of years, and this surge has resulted in a severe shortage in housing facilities for these new asylum applicants. [42] In response to this crisis, the French government has endeavored to create 11,000 new CADA and similar emergency housing facilities in 2016. [43]b. Temporary Financial AssistanceAdditionally, asylum seekers in France are legally entitled to financial assistance called the allocation pour demandeur d’asile (ADA, Asylum Seeker Benefit) if their monthly income is under a certain threshold. [44] The amount of financial assistance depends on factors such as the applicant’s financial resources, the type of housing that he/she resides in, and the number of dependents in his/her family. [45] Before any potential deduction or supplementation, the basic benefit is €6.80 (approximately US$7.37) per day for a single person, to be paid at the end of each month. [46] This is increased to €10.20 (US$11.05) per day for a two-person family, €13.60 (US$14.73) per day for a three-person family, and so forth. [47] If the asylum seeker and his/her family have not been given housing in a CADA or similar facility, an extra €4.20 (US$4.55) per day is added to help them pay for lodging. [48]This financial assistance ends when the government authorities have come to a final decision on the asylum seeker’s application. [49] If the decision was positive (the asylum seeker was granted either refugee status or subsidiary protection), the person becomes eligible for the same welfare benefits as regular French citizens, as noted earlier. Furthermore, even while the asylum seeker’s application is being considered by the government authorities, his/her ADA payments may be suspended for certain causes, such as if the asylum seeker left his/her place of residence without authorization, failed to show up at meetings with the authorities, or failed to respond to the authorities’ requests for information. [50] The ADA payments may be ended entirely if the asylum seeker is found to have lied about his/her financial resources or family situation, or if he/she engaged in violent behavior or seriously breached the rules of his/her place of lodging. [51]IV. The Admission of RefugeesA. Visas for the Purpose of AsylumAn applicant must be either on French territory or at a French border crossing to request asylum. [52] An application for asylum cannot be made from another country. [53] Before coming to France, however, an asylum seeker may request a special visa for the purpose of asylum from the French embassy or consulate closest to his/her place of residence. [54] This will allow the asylum seeker to enter France, and then submit an application for asylum from within France. [55] The principal advantage of entering France on such a visa rather than entering France illegally or on another type of visa (such as a tourist or student visa) is that applicants who came on the basis of a visa for the purpose of asylum are authorized to work while their asylum application is being processed. [56] By contrast, an asylum seeker who did not enter France on the basis of a visa for the purpose of asylum may not work until the competent French authorities come to a decision on his/her application for asylum (if, for reasons that are not of the applicant’s doing, the authorities take more than nine months to come to a decision, the applicant may legally work nine months after the registration of his/her application for asylum). [57]It is worth noting that there is no statutory foundation for visas for the purpose of asylum, but rather they are the product of executive instructions to France’s consular stations. [58] These instructions require the consular authorities to protect the visa applicant’s confidentiality, and the visa document does not actually mention anything about asylum. [59] This discretion is meant to avoid bringing the asylum seeker to the attention of potential persecutors while he/she is still in his/her country of origin.It appears that approximately 791 visas were granted to Syrian nationals for the purpose of asylum during the year 2013 (155 were granted in Syria proper, and 636 were granted by French consulates in countries neighboring Syria), a significant increase compared to previous years. [60] However, these numbers appear very modest compared to the many thousands of refugees from that region who tried to enter Europe during that time period. [61] According to some estimates, approximately 5,000 Syrians, including 3,000 with refugee status, entered France between March 2011 and February 2014, [62] which would seem to indicate that most entered France without the benefit of a special visa for the purpose of asylum.B. The Principal ActorsThe principal government body in charge of processing and evaluating asylum applications is the Office français de protection des réfugiés et apatrides (OFPRA, French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons). [63] Several other entities also play important roles, however, particularly the Cour nationale du droit d’asile (CNDA, National Court on Asylum Law), the Office français de l’immigration et de l’intégration (OFII, French Office for Immigration and Assimilation), and a number of specialized nonprofit organizations. [64]The French asylum system appears to rely on nonprofit organizations to a very large degree. As mentioned earlier, many refugee housing facilities are managed by nonprofit organizations. In addition to that role, refugee-centered nonprofits are responsible for informing and guiding asylum seekers throughout the application process. [65]The main point of contact between asylum applicants and the government authorities is the OFII, which coordinates the French asylum system and often acts as the intermediary between applicants and the OFPRA. [66] There are thirty-four OFII offices located within prefectures around the country. [67]The CNDA is a specialized administrative court set up to hear asylum seekers’ appeals against unfavorable decisions of the OFPRA. [68] Placed under the authority of a member of the Conseil d’Etat (Council of State, France’s highest court in matters of administrative law), this court is divided into several judging sections, each composed of a judge and two assistants (assesseurs). [69] One of the two assistants in each judging section is nominated by the UNHCR. [70] While the standard hearing panel configuration is the three-member judging section, cases that are deemed particularly important may be heard by the court in “large formation” (grande formation), composed of three judges (including the president of the court) and six assistants, three of these assistants being UNHCR nominees. [71] Conversely, a judge may decide a case by him/herself when the convening of a regular three-member hearing formation would not be justified. [72] Examples of such cases include situations where an appeal does not bring up any serious argument to reverse the OFPRA’s decision, the appeal must be rejected as being procedurally defective, or the appeal must be rejected because it does not fall within the CNDA’s jurisdiction. [73] Decisions of the CNDA are appealable to the Conseil d’Etat. [74]C. Procedure for Requesting Asylum at a French Border CrossingIf a person arrives at a French border crossing point (typically a port, an airport, or a major train station) without the proper documents to enter French territory, he/she may ask the border police for asylum. [75] The border police will give the asylum seeker (in a language that he/she can understand) information on the asylum procedure, his/her rights and obligations, and the assistance that he/she may be entitled to. [76] The asylum seeker will be kept in a “waiting zone” (zone d’attente, often an international transit zone) while French authorities do a preliminary assessment to decide whether he/she should be admitted into France. [77] Entry will be refused if the asylum seeker’s case is found to be the responsibility of another country under the rules of the EU’s Dublin Regulation, [78] the request for asylum is clearly improper or fraudulent, the request for asylum is inadmissible (for example, if asylum was already granted by another country), the request for asylum is clearly unfounded (for example, if it is incoherent or has no credibility), or the applicant would be a threat to public order. [79] This preliminary investigation is conducted by the OFPRA, but the decision to admit an applicant into France or not belongs to the Ministry of the Interior, after consulting the OFPRA. [80] The OFPRA usually renders its evaluation within four days, and in any case an applicant may not be held in the waiting zone for more than twenty days. [81]An applicant who is denied entry into France has forty-eight hours to appeal the decision before an administrative judge. [82] The administrative judge then has seventy-two hours to either confirm or invalidate the denial of entry, and this decision is, in turn, appealable to an administrative court of appeals. [83] If the denial of entry is not reversed, the applicant is sent back to his/her country of origin (or the country from which he/she came to France) at the expense of the transport company that carried him/her to France. [84]An applicant who is authorized to enter France for the purpose of seeking asylum is given a temporary visa, which is valid for eight days. [85] During that eight-day period, the asylum seeker must submit an application for asylum to a local prefecture, as described below. [86]D. Procedure for Requesting Asylum from Within FranceThe following procedure applies for the asylum seeker who is already on French territory, either because he/she entered France illegally, because he/she was granted the temporary visa described above, or because he/she entered France on the basis of another visa or stay permit (student visa, tourist visa, etc.).1. Registration at a Local PrefectureThe asylum seeker’s first step is to register as an asylum seeker with the French authorities. [87] The competent authorities for this registration are the local prefectural services. [88] These services verify whether France is responsible for protecting the asylum seeker under the rules of the EU Dublin Regulation. [89] The prefectural services have up to three days to make this determination, except when they are faced with a high number of foreigners asking for asylum at the same time, in which case they may take up to ten days to make a determination. [90] If no other country is found to be responsible for protecting the asylum seeker under the Dublin Regulation, the prefectural services give the applicant a document certifying that he/she is registered as an asylum seeker. [91] This registration document does not authorize the applicant to travel within the European Union. [92] Furthermore, it may be denied or taken away in certain cases, including (a) when the OFPRA has found that the applicant already benefits from protection in another country; (b) when the asylum seeker retracts his/her application for asylum; (c) when the asylum seeker’s file is closed because of his/her failure to file required forms in a timely manner or attend required meetings, or due to his/her refusal to provide important information; (d) when the asylum seeker requests a reconsideration of his/her application after a final denial; or (e) when the asylum seeker is the subject of a European arrest warrant, an arrest request from an international criminal court, or a decision to extradite him/her to a country other than his/her country of origin. [93]In addition to the registration document mentioned above, the prefectural services give the asylum seeker an asylum application form, as well as information on the asylum application process, his/her rights and obligations during that process, assistance he/she is entitled to (lodging, financial assistance, etc.), and any local organizations that help asylum seekers. [94]2. The OFPRA’s InvestigationAn asylum seeker must submit his/her application for asylum to the OFPRA within twenty-one days of receiving his/her registration document. [95] The OFPRA must then reach a decision within six months. [96] This time limit may be extended to a maximum of nine additional months in certain circumstances, such as when complex issues of fact and/or law are involved, when large numbers of asylum seekers apply for protection at the same time, or when the delay is clearly attributable to the applicant’s failure to comply with his/her obligations. [97] If the OFPRA is unable to reach a decision within six months, it must notify the applicant of that fact at least fifteen days before the end of the six-month period. [98]The OFPRA must investigate applications under an “accelerated procedure” when the asylum seeker comes from a safe country. [99] The OFPRA may also, if it chooses, investigate under an accelerated procedure in cases where (a) the asylum seeker is found to have sought to mislead the OFPRA by providing fake documents, lying, or concealing information regarding his/her identity, nationality, and/or entry into France; (b) the asylum seeker is found to have submitted several applications for asylum under different identities; (c) the asylum seeker’s application only rests on elements that are irrelevant to asylum; (d) the asylum seeker’s statements to the OFPRA are clearly incoherent, contradictory, false, or very implausible; (e) the asylum seeker refuses to provide his/her fingerprints; (f) the asylum seeker, without legitimate reason, had stayed in France illegally for over 120 days before he/she submitted an application for asylum; or (g) the only purpose for the application for asylum is to delay deportation. [100] Under such an accelerated procedure, the OFPRA is supposed to reach a decision on the application within fifteen days. [101]The OFPRA conducts an investigation to verify whether the applicant fulfills the criteria for refugee status or subsidiary protection. [102] The OFPRA evaluates all relevant evidence, including the applicant’s statements and any documentation concerning his/her identity, age, personal and family history, nationality, travel documents, past residences, past requests for asylum, itinerary, and the reasons for which he/she is seeking asylum. [103] The agency also takes into consideration the current situation in the country of origin, as well as any activity that the applicant has engaged in since leaving the country of origin that may expose him/her to persecution or harm if he/she were to return there. [104] It appears that special weight is given to evidence that the applicant has been the victim of past persecution, serious harm, or direct threats in the country of origin. [105]The applicant is required to cooperate with the agency’s investigation, which generally includes an interview. [106] The applicant may be interviewed in the presence of an attorney or of a representative from an authorized nonprofit advocacy group. [107] The presence of an attorney or advocate is not required, however, and if present, the attorney or advocate may not speak until the end of the interview. [108] The OFPRA may also, as part of its investigation, request that the applicant submit to a medical examination. [109]The OFPRA is held to a strict obligation of confidentiality. It is required to conduct its investigation without divulging the existence of a request for asylum to the alleged authors of persecution or harm. [110] The OFPRA must also conduct its investigation without divulging any information that might endanger anyone or that might jeopardize the agency’s ability to conduct future investigations. [111]3. The OFPRA’s DecisionThe OFPRA must provide a decision in writing to the applicant. [112] All decisions denying refugee status must include the grounds, both factual and legal, for the denial of protection. [113] Decisions awarding subsidiary protection must also be reasoned, inasmuch as such decisions are technically denials of refugee status. [114] The OFPRA must also communicate its decision, whether it is positive or negative, to the prefect of the asylum seeker’s place of residence. [115]As mentioned in Part II above, the status of refugee or subsidiary protection may be revoked. The OFPRA may revoke protection, either on its own initiative or upon the request of the Minister of the Interior or a local prefect, in the following situations: (a) in any of the circumstances described in sections C, D, E, and F of article 1 of the Geneva Convention of July 28, 1951; (b) if the decision to grant protection is found to have been the result of a fraud; (c) when there are serious reasons to believe that the person’s presence in France would present a grave threat to the safety of the state; or (d) when the person was found guilty of an act of terrorism or a serious crime in France, and his/her continued presence in France would present a grave threat to society. [116]4. Recourse Before the Cour nationale du droit d’asile (CNDA)Asylum seekers may appeal decisions of the OFPRA to the CNDA within one month of being notified. [117] The CNDA must judge a case within five months of the date of the appeal. [118] The CNDA may either (a) deny the applicant’s appeal, (b) reverse the OFPRA’s decision and grant asylum to the applicant, or (c) quash the OFPRA’s decision and send the case back to it for further investigation.

(Photo courtesy of Marilyn Rodriguez)Editor’s Note: This story has been updated to include strong denials from pro-Trump protesters of allegations they singled out dark-skinned individuals, as well as video links showing their interactions during a protest at the Capitol on Jan. 25.Supporters of President Donald Trump singled out dark-skinned lawmakers, legislative staffers and children at the Capitol on Jan. 25 as they protested congressional efforts to pass immigration reform, according to staffers of the Arizona Legislature and two Democratic legislators.Waving large flags in support of Trump while standing between the House and Senate buildings, the protesters, who were also armed, asked just about anyone who crossed their path if they “support illegal immigration.”They called some “illegal” and told them to “go home,” barbs they reserved for those with brown skin, according to the staffers.Two women who said they were part of the protest against illegal immigration at the Capitol vehemently denied accusations that they singled out dark-skinned people and accused them of being illegal immigrants.But Lisette Flores and Selianna Robles, policy advisors for Senate Democrats, said they were yelled at when they walked from the Senate to the House lawn, directly passing the Trump supporters, to get lunch at a farmers market. Three white coworkers offered to escort Flores, Robles, and Democratic staffer Dora Ramirez back to their offices, Robles said.“We’re walking back, and they start yelling again, ‘Get out of the country.’ At that point, they pointed to Lisette, called her an illegal, and said, ‘Get out, go back home!’” Robles said. “But they pointed at Jane (Ahern), who works for the House, and they said, ‘No, you can stay.’”Ahern, a policy advisor for House Democrats, is white.“I was born in California,” said Flores. “I’m obviously of Mexican descent, so I think in that group I’m the darkest one. Selianna and Dora, they’re light-skinned Latinos. So, I think probably that’s why they pointed at me out of a group of six.”“They assume things about you. There’s not much we can do,” said Robles, an Arizona native raised in the town of San Luis. “We work for the state, we’re public servants, and we’re just here to do our job.”Lawmakers said they were also questioned based on their appearance. Rep. Eric Descheenie, D-Chinle, said he was confronted by Trump supporters while helping defend a young student that he said was being harassed.They asked Descheenie, a Navajo lawmaker, if he was in the United States illegally.Rep. Eric Descheenie (D-Chinle)“I’m indigenous to these lands,” Descheenie said. “My ancestors fought and died on these lands. I just told them, ‘Don’t ask me that question.’”Rep. César Chávez, D-Phoenix, said he was approached by a female Trump supporter asking who he was and who he represents. For “the fun of it,” Chávez said, he replied, “I’m an undocumented legislator.” Chávez was brought from Mexico to the United States as a child.He said he wanted the protesters “to understand that in this country, through a process, you, too, can be a part of a nation that provides opportunity to everybody. I wanted them to understand that an individual who came to this country undocumented at the age of three is now a member of the Arizona State Legislature.”Chávez said the woman reacted by calling him “illegal.”“She said something like, “You’re illegal. Once illegal, always illegal,” he said. “I took no offense, no attention. It was just simply one of those things where you’re going to have a stance and I’m going to have a stance and we’re never going to agree on things.”Jennifer Caminiti-Harrison and Lesa Antone said they were at the Capitol to protest activists with Living United for Change in Arizona (LUCHA). The women told the Arizona Capitol Times in a phone interview tonight they’re against illegal immigration and don’t believe the LUCHA activists, who they alleged are undocumented, have the right to lobby state legislators.In denying the allegations, Caminiti-Harrison and Antone countered that their group was harassed by the LUCHA activists. In a live stream of the protest uploaded to Facebook by Antone, a LUCHA member could be heard telling a black Trump supporter, “You’re gonna be the first to get lynched.”“First, we were a group of several white, black and Latina Americans. To make assumptions that we were only calling out Hispanic representatives or ‘non-white’ legislatures (sic) is a disgusting, blatant lie,” Caminiti-Harrison also wrote in an email. “We also had legal immigrants visiting the Capitol who stood in solidarity with us along with Republican lawmakers who thanked us for being there and stopped for a photo.”In a video uploaded to YouTube , Republican Reps. Jay Lawrenece, of Scottsdale, and Bob Thorpe, of Flagstaff, are seen speaking and taking photos with protesters.“We asked every rep, white or otherwise, if they supported illegal immigration and why they put the needs of illegal immigrants over the needs of American citizens,” Caminiti-Harrison wrote. “Never at any time did we ask the representatives if they were illegals. Never.”A 14-minute video of yesterday’s protest uploaded on YouTube shows several interactions initiated by the anti-illegal immigration protesters. Near the beginning of the video, one protester could be heard assuming that members of a group are staying illegally in the U.S.“No, they’re not legal. They’re illegal,” a woman can be heard saying.“Yeah, we know they’re illegal. Get legal or get out of America … They’re illegal, see that?” another woman shouted at the group.In another part of the video, a woman can be heard confronting a group of men.“Why do you want to stay in our country if you hate it so much?” she said.One member of the group, a man, came back to tell the protester that she and others “need to get educated.”They exchanged a few more words, and he said, “This land wasn’t your guys.’” She yelled at him as he walked away, “You are an illegal alien.”When the man denied the accusation, the woman responded: “Those guys are illegal … They do not have any rights here. It is not their time. This is our time. Our nation. Our laws. Our streets.”The video also shows what appeared to be a LUCHA activist shielding a young man who was being questioned by the protester about his stance on immigration.“So, you also believe in ‘No border, No wall, No USA at all? Do you also believe in that? … Because if you do, why are you here? Because if you don’t support America, why are you here?” the protester said.“He’s not talking to you,” the LUCHA activist tells the protester and unleashes a profane word. Another protester then replies, “Get legal or get out. Go in there and fill your [expletive] paper out and get legal.”Trump supporters also disrupted a press conference hosted Thursday morning by LUCHA activists who came to the Capitol to raise awareness about legislation they’re backing.As LUCHA Executive Director Tomas Robles spoke to a crowd of supporters in Spanish, Trump supporters could be heard shouting over him , “Go home.”“I served five years in the Marine Corps. I fought for people’s freedoms to be able to come into this space and to be able to voice their concerns to the representatives that represent their cities and towns,” he said. “The fact that I got called an illegal, the fact that all our constituents were called so many names … every single person has a right to be here.”Antone posted on Facebook a nearly two-hour video showing pro-Trump supporters shouting at the LUCHA activists on the subject of wages. At one point, a woman who was part of the pro-Trump group yelled at the LUCHA activists, “You don’t deserve more money just for showing up … You don’t get more money ’cause you’re brown.”Mary Lou Sandoval, a Maryvale resident who attended the LUCHA event, later saw the protesters screaming at children who were touring the Capitol on field trips.“[It] was a little ridiculous. You can protest peacefully as well, and you can make your own presence [felt] peacefully,” she said.Senate Minority Leader Katie Hobbs (D-Phoenix) (Photo by Katie Campbell/Arizona Capitol Times)Senate Minority Leader Katie Hobbs, D-Phoenix, wrote a letter to Senate President Steve Yarbrough, R-Chandler, and Senate security officials outlining what she called the harassment of staffers who the protesters “perceived not to be white,” and complained about a lack of response from law enforcement at the scene observing the protest.“I can tell you that the Democratic staff who were yelled at by the protesters and called illegals definitely felt harassed and were not satisfied with the response,” Hobbs wrote. “They did not feel safe.”Hobbs said she was told by an officer on Thursday that law enforcement was instructed to stand down while the Trump supporters exercised their First Amendment rights.Their protest went “far beyond” the First Amendment, Hobbs wrote.“This is a public place. When armed protesters aggressively go after members, staff and visitors, there needs to be a response that ensures the safety of everyone involved,” Hobbs wrote. “I have seen instances here at the capital (sic) when peaceful protesters with a different agenda were surrounded by many more law enforcement officers with a much more aggressive response.”“This is unacceptable,” she added.Officials with the Department of Public Safety did not return a request for comment.Read Hobb’s letter below.",2018/01/26,snopes,1

It's the way things are done here, Personally I'm for the mixing of the sexes, but I'm not about to argue, I'm outnumbered.Up on the stage there's music and dancing. Everyone's having a good time, even me, although the Hamas robocops are making me a little nervous. Sure Hamas have cold blooded killers among them, sure they support the murder of children in Israel,sure they are cracking down on women's rights, but many of their supporters are just ordinary people. And they need a break.The men and women are sitting, Most ignore the speeches, some even ignore the prayers. Then the fireworksexplode, the cheering begins, and in march the Hamas scouts, bashing drums, looking every inch the future Hamas fighters many will be. Then the grooms, aged about 18 to about 28. They are holding hands with their young nieces and cousins, little girls aged from about 3 to 8, made up to the nines, wearing white wedding dresses.Up they all go to the stage, the cheering and music grows ever louder. The girls were having the time of their lives, but, getting a little bored after a while, came down off the stage to dance with each other and play games.Our report on this put it into context saying that it took place just a mile from the Israeli border and was a message from Hamas about its strength confidence and future fighters. Oh and that the brides were elsewhere. Pretty straightforward.It never struck me for a moment that the little girls might later be described in the bloggersphere as the brides! How naive I am.Dozens, and I mean dozens, of websites took the video of the event and wrote lurid stories about Hamas mass paedophilia with headlines about '450 child brides', and endless copy about how disgusting this was, how it showed how depraved Islam is, et al, ad infinitum. Site after site jumped on the story, linking from one totally wrong load of rubbish to the next . I'll give credit to Tundra Tabloids who at least took down the video, but most sites just ploughed on regardless.I spent a few hours visiting websites and leaving comments where I could. To little avail. Instead I received a steady stream of vitriol. The best response was on a site run by a Debbie Schlussel . The guy who posted it said he wasn't interested in the detail. The detail being the fact that the girls weren't the brides.It showed how much some people want to believe nonsense like this, as it re-inforces their prejudices, always a comfortably fun thing to do. But Hamas, and the jihadists do enough terrible things without having to make things up about them. Most of the stuff I read was outright, unthinking, gleeful, Islamophobia from people who clearly knew nothing about Arab popular culture. It's as is they really beleive that because there are examples of child brides, it means all weddings are with child brides.Some sites went so far as to complain that the mainstream media were complicit in paedophilia because they had reported the mass wedding but failed to mention that little girls were about to be raped that night. And so it went on, and on.Perhaps I was making up the fact that the brides were elsewhere. It's possible. But who would you believe, the reporter who went to the event, or a desperately poor version of citizen journalist, sitting at home, making things up, not checking anything, and either unknowingly or deliberately, writing hysterical anti Islamic nonsense.",2009/08/07,snopes,0

They can range in size, from a tiny grain of sand to, in extreme cases, the size of a golf ball. Patients with kidney stones don't always need treatment, because the stones can pass out of the body on their own, but the process of passing them can be quite painful. The stones must travel from the kidney down the ureter and to the bladder, and then exit the body through the urethra.The authors of the new study, published today (Sept. 26) in the Journal of the American Osteopathic Association , noticed that several of their patients had reported passing kidney stones after going on the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad roller coaster at Disney World in Florida.In one instance, for example, a man told the doctors that he passed a stone after three consecutive rides on the roller coaster, according to the study. [ 16 Oddest Medical Cases ]Studying this phenomenon required a bit of ingenuity from the researchers. To test the effects of riding a roller coaster with kidney stones, they created a 3D model of a kidney that could be taken along for the ride (concealed in a backpack, of course).In the experiment, the researchers placed three real kidney stones and some urine in the model kidney. The kidney stones were different sizes: small (4.5 cubic millimeters), medium (13.5 cubic mm) and large (64.6 cubic mm).The researchers took the model kidney on the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad roller coaster 20 times. They experimented with the position of the different sizes of kidney stones in different parts of their kidney model. On one ride, for example, the largest stone was placed in the upper part of the kidney; on another, the large stone was placed in the middle of the kidney. Ultimately, each stone was placed in each location of the kidney for at least one ride.The researchers noted that one aspect of the experiment that they could not control was where they sat on the roller coaster. Indeed, ""seat assignment on the roller coaster was random and determined as a function of place in the waiting line ,"" they wrote.But seat assignment turned out to be important. When the researchers were seated in the rear car of the roller coaster, the kidney stones, regardless of their size or location in the kidney, passed nearly 64 percent of the time, according to the study.When the researchers sat in the front of the roller coaster, however, the stones passed only about 17 percent of the time, the researchers found.The preliminary study's findings ""support the anecdotal evidence that a ride on a moderate-intensity roller coaster could benefit some patients with small kidney stones,"" Dr. David Wartinger, a professor emeritus of urology at the Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine and a co-author of the study, said in a statement.Riding a roller coaster after having treatments such as lithotripsy — a procedure that aims to break up kidney stones into smaller particles using ultrasound shock waves — could prevent stones from getting larger and causing additional problems, Wartinger said.Originally published on Live Science .You'd Also Like",2016/09/27,snopes,1

Heinrich Himmler (1900-45), a fervent anti-Semite like Hitler, became head of the Schutzstaffel, or SS, in 1929 and expanded the group’s role and size. Recruits, who had to prove none of their ancestors were Jewish, received military training and were also taught they were the elite not only of the Nazi Party but of all humankind. By the start of World War II (1939-45), the SS had more than 250,000 members and multiple subdivisions, engaged in activities ranging from intelligence operations to running Nazi concentration camps. At the postwar Nuremberg trials, the SS was deemed a criminal organization for its direct involvement in war crimes. In 1921, Adolf Hitler became the leader of a fledgling political organization called the National Socialist German Workers’ (Nazi) Party. The group promoted extreme German nationalism and anti-Semitism, and was dissatisfied with the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, the 1919 peace settlement that ended World War I (1914-18) and required numerous concessions and reparations from Germany. Did you know? A separate wing of the Dachau concentration camp was set aside for SS members found guilty of committing serious infractions. Close to 130 SS members were interned at Dachau when the camp was liberated by U.S. military forces on April 29, 1945. By the end of 1921, Hitler had his own private army, the “Sturmabteilung” (“Assault Division”), or SA, whose members were known as storm troopers or brown shirts (for the color of their uniforms). The SA accompanied Hitler during his public appearances and surrounded him when he made impassioned speeches urging his supporters to perpetrate violence against Jews and his political adversaries. In 1925, Hitler ordered the formation of the Schutzstaffel, an entity that was separate from, although linked to, the SA. The SS initially consisted of eight individuals, all of whom were entrusted to personally guard Hitler and other top Nazis. Julius Schreck (1898-1936), a dedicated Hitler loyalist, became the first commander of the SS. The following year, Schreck, who frequently wore a fake moustache that resembled Hitler’s, was replaced by Joseph Berchtold (1897-1962). Erhard Heiden (1901-33) took control of the SS in 1927. That same year, SS members were banned from partaking in political debate and were required to profess undying loyalty to Hitler and unquestioningly acknowledge him as their one and only prophet. On January 6, 1929, Hitler named Heinrich Himmler commander of the SS, which at the time had close to 300 members. Himmler, who like Hitler was a fervent anti-Semite, had joined the Nazi Party in 1923 and eventually served as Hitler’s deputy propaganda chief. Himmler was determined to separate the SS from the SA, transform the SS into an elite force that was larger and more potent than the SA and, finally, alter the function of the organization within the Nazi Party. Under Himmler’s guidance, the SS evolved over the next four years into a first-rate paramilitary unit. To qualify for the SS, prospective members had to prove that none of their ancestors were Jewish and agree to marry only with the consent of their superior officers. In addition to receiving military training, recruits were taught that they were the elite not only of the Nazi Party but of all humankind. Above all else, they were to value allegiance and obligation to the Nazi ideal, place individual concerns aside and perform their duties diligently and as a cohesive unit. By 1932, the SS had grown to include thousands of members, and the group began wearing all-black uniforms. When Hitler became Germany’s chancellor on January 30, 1933, SS membership had increased to over 50,000. In March of that year, Himmler announced the opening of the first Nazi concentration camp, in the town of Dachau, Germany. The camp initially housed political prisoners who opposed the Nazis. In April 1934, Himmler was named head of Germany’s secret state police, the “Geheime Staatspolizei,” more commonly known as the “Gestapo.” The Gestapo, which had been established the previous year, was charged with tracking down and arresting Hitler’s adversaries. Without benefit of trial, these alleged enemies either were executed or dispatched to concentration camps. At the same time, Himmler was one of the primary behind-the-scenes forces in the removal from power of Ernst Röhm (1887-1934), head of the SA. On June 30, 1934, during a purge of major SA officials that came to be known as the “Night of the Long Knives,” Röhm was arrested. He was executed several days later. The elimination of Röhm further increased Himmler’s profile within the Nazi hierarchy and partially led to him becoming one of the most powerful and feared men in all of Nazi Germany. During the mid-1930s, two significant SS subdivisions came into existence. One was the “SS Verfügungstruppen,” or SS-VT, a military unit whose members were quartered in barracks. In order to be accepted into the SS-VT, recruits had to agree to a four-year compulsory terms of service. The second subdivision was the “Totenkopfverbande,” or “Death’s Head Unit,” whose members operated Hitler’s concentration camps. The Totenkopfverbande was so named because the caps worn by its members were decorated with an insignia that featured the image of a skull. This emblem was not meant to imply that the Totenkopfverbande was carrying out murderous acts. Rather, it symbolized that the unit was committed to remaining faithful to Hitler to the death. At the outset of World War II (1939-45), by which time SS membership numbered more than 250,000, Himmler established the “Waffen-SS,” or “Armed-SS,” essentially an expanded version of the SS-VT. The Waffen-SS consisted of a cadre of combat troops who specialized in brutalizing and murdering individuals in territories occupied by the Nazis. They were also involved in the daily operation of Hitler’s death camps. Within six months of its formation, Waffen-SS members numbered 150,000, according to some reports. Not all were German nationals. In 1940, Himmler proposed the recruitment of non-German citizens, and the Waffen-SS eventually included ethnic Germans who hailed from Hungary, Yugoslavia, Romania and elsewhere, along with volunteers from practically every country the Nazis annexed, as well as Great Britain. For example, the Waffen-SS Charlemagne Division, formed in 1944, consisted of over 20,000 Frenchmen. As the war progressed, accounts differed as to the actual number of SS and Waffen-SS members. According to one report, by June 1944, 800,000 Nazis and Nazi supporters had been accepted into the SS and its subdivisions. Another account cited Waffen-SS membership alone at between 800,000 and 910,000 in October 1944. In 1945, as the defeat of Nazi Germany seemed increasingly certain, Himmler became chief organizer of the “Volkssturm,” or “People’s Storm Troop,” a unit whose members were the polar opposite of those who qualified for the SS. The Volkssturm consisted of a cobbled-together army of teenage boys and elderly men whose improbable task was to be the last line of resistance against the Allies. As Germany went down to defeat, Himmler was captured by Allied soldiers. He committed suicide on May 23, 1945, by ingesting a cyanide capsule. Following World War II, the Nuremberg military tribunals, in session from 1945 to 1949, were empowered to bring war criminals to justice. The tribunal declared the SS a criminal organization because of its direct involvement in committing war atrocities.",2014/03/07,snopes,0

According to the Greeks, Sardanapalus had a phrase very like it engraved upon his tomb ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 500). Sailors have often acted upon it, when they found it impossible to save their ship. On seeing their city invested, a portion of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, despairing of safety, did as sailors have done so frequently.

They made sure of water for the city. But they were regardless of God in all these preparations. They did not care for his glory in what they did. They did not depend upon him for a blessing on their endeavours. For every creature is to us what God makes it to be; and we must bless him for it, and use it for him. There was great contempt of God's wrath and justice, in contending with them. God's design was to humble them, and bring them to repentance. They walked contrary to this. Actual disbelief of another life after this, is at the bottom of the carnal security and brutish sensuality, which are the sin, the shame, and ruin of so great a part of mankind. God was displeased at this. It is a sin against the remedy, and it is not likely they should ever repent of it.",2013/05/24,snopes,0

The conflict was sparked Friday after the Raleigh Police Protective Association wrote a Facebook post sarcastically thanking the restaurant for its “class and professionalism as you sang ‘F- the police’ as my brothers at Raleigh Police Department attempted to eat at your restaurant. The manager sang along as well. Do you really feel that was appropriate?”On Wednesday, Deck-Brown said two officers saw one employee make eye contact with them and mouth the words “F--- the Police.”FLASH SALE: Only $0.99 per monthSave on your first 3 months of digital access.

There were no other employees involved,” Deck-Brown said. “Because of the subtle nature of this act, it was not witnessed by anyone else in the store.”After looking at video, Harris and O’Mara and others could find no evidence that employees were singing at the police or even speaking with them during the nearly half-hour they were in the restaurant.SHARECOPY LINKVIDEO: Smithfield’s Chicken ’n Bar-B-Q owner says video that he released doesn’t show employees singing “F--- the Police” to Raleigh Police Friday at the store located at 4000 Jones Sausage Road.ByO’Mara said the officers in the restaurant contacted a friend who then posted what turned out to be an incorrect account of what happened on Facebook.“Now, you know, 400,000 hits later, we are the company that doesn’t like cops,” O’Mara said.According to O’Mara, the interaction between the employee and the two officers happened while the officers were at the counter.After getting their food and eating their meal, the officers went to speak with a manager about their encounter, O’Mara said. The manager apologized, but the officers said they wanted to talk to the owner, Harris’ co-franchisee at the Jones Sausage store, Willie McKennies.The manager gave the officers a number, but McKennies was at another store working and did not pick up the first two phone calls from the officers, O’Mara said.The officers and McKennies did talk eventually, but before then one of the officers contacted a friend, a detective, and the story eventually made its way to social media, O’Mara said.“It was embellished, and all of a sudden it was a bunch of officers and they were singing, none of which the initial officers said,” O’Mara said.In an interview Saturday, Raleigh Police Protective Association President Matthew Cooper, who shared the Facebook post, said, “This is something that, unfortunately, officers have to deal with now on a regular basis.”The association’s post went up at 8:33 p.m. on Friday. Within three hours Harris posted an apology and promised to investigate and “terminate anyone employed that doesn’t share our RESPECT of ALL law enforcement.” He said Wednesday that one employee who was asked about his involvement in the incident has quit.The post on the association’s page was later deleted. A new post went up Wednesday acknowledging the mistake and encouraging officers to continue dining at Smithfield’s.“There was an investigation conducted, and while there were inappropriate comments made by an employee of the restaurant, not all the information in the post was accurate,” the association said.Harris has worked for Smithfield’s for 24 years and owned the restaurant on Jones Sausage with McKennies since it opened 17 years ago. The restaurant has a Garner address but is in the city of Raleigh.Since news broke on the issue, Harris said he has been deeply hurt by the portrayal of his restaurant.“I’m very frustrated with the way we were cast,” he said.Harris said he has a long-standing relationship with the police department and hopes it will continue. The store has already put up words of support on its sign out front and said it will do more in the coming weeks.",2017/05/03,snopes,0
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/fiercefemtivist-nurse-racist-parents/,a baby died at an unnamed medical facility because its parents refused to allow a black nurse to care for the child. see example( s ),Unproven,"['fiercefemtivist', ' racism']",http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/,http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/120/6/1385,2015/11/10,"Recognizing and Responding to Medical NeglectCarole Jenny and the Committee on Child Abuse and NeglectDownload PDFAbstractA caregiver may fail to recognize or respond to a child's medical needs for a variety of reasons. An effective response by a health care professional to medical neglect requires a comprehensive assessment of the child's needs, the parents' resources, the parents' efforts to provide for the needs of the child, and options for ensuring optimal health for the child. Such an assessment requires clear, 2-way communication between the family and the health care professional. Physicians should consider the least intrusive options for managing cases of medical neglect that ensure the health and safety of the child.cultural competencyINTRODUCTIONPediatricians are sometimes confronted in practice by children whose medical needs are being neglected. In the United States, medical neglect accounts for 2.3% of all substantiated cases of child maltreatment. 1 This represents the “tip of the iceberg,” because only the most egregious and intractable cases are likely to be reported to authorities.Medical neglect usually takes 1 of 2 forms: failure to heed obvious signs of serious illness or failure to follow a physician's instructions once medical advice has been sought. Either of these situations can be fatal in some cases or can lead to chronic disability. 2Several factors are considered necessary for the diagnosis of medical neglect 3 :a child is harmed or is at risk of harm because of lack of health care;the recommended health care offers significant net benefit to the child;the anticipated benefit of the treatment is significantly greater than its morbidity, so that reasonable caregivers would choose treatment over nontreatment;it can be demonstrated that access to health care is available and not used; andthe caregiver understands the medical advice given.In many cases, no harm will occur if the caregiver opts not to seek medical care for an ill child. For example, if children have high fevers caused by self-limited viral illnesses, they are unlikely to suffer adverse consequences if they do not receive medical care, even if they appear acutely ill. On the other hand, if a child with a stomachache caused by appendicitis fails to receive medical care, the results can be dangerous. However, when a procedure carries inherent danger or a drug has significant adverse effects, labeling a caregiver's reluctance to cooperate as neglect may be problematic. 2 In some situations, health care professionals may evaluate risks and benefits of drugs or procedures differently than families.REASONS THAT FAMILIES FAIL TO SEEK APPROPRIATE MEDICAL CAREMany factors can lead to children not receiving appropriate medical care. It is important to consider these etiologies in planning for the alleviation of the problem. The child can be seen as the center of an ecological framework within which lack of medical care may result from interactions among a variety of interdependent factors. 4Patient and Parent FactorsPoverty or Economic HardshipMany families lack financial resources to care for children with acute or chronic illnesses. For some parents, taking time from work to care for sick children can lead to decreased income or even loss of their jobs.Lack of Access to CareThe number of children in the United States who do not have health insurance is estimated to be between 8.7 and 11.1 million. 5 Other barriers to access include geographic constraints (such as long distances to care and lack of transportation), lack of baby-sitters for siblings, lack of available health care professionals, and language barriers.Family Chaos and DisorganizationSome families lack order and routine in their lives. Interactions are inconsistent and fragmented. Parents may be unable to respond to the children's needs in an effective manner. These families may have a difficult time responding appropriately to medical emergencies, and it may be even more difficult to meet the needs of chronically ill children who require ongoing medications and treatments.Lack of Awareness, Knowledge, or SkillsCaregivers may not be aware of the signs or symptoms in their children that could indicate serious illness. They may not understand why a medication or treatment is prescribed or why it is important to follow through with their physicians' instructions.Lack of Trust in Health Care ProfessionalsSome families may refuse advice because they lack trust in physicians or organized medicine because of what they have heard from friends or the media or because of previous negative experiences with the health care system.Impairment of CaregiversIf a child's caregiver is developmentally delayed or mentally ill, he or she may not have the capacity to respond to the child's health care needs. Substance abuse can also interfere with normal caregiving. In cases in which parents cannot comprehend the child's need for care, the children might need protection from a social service agency if they are in danger, even if the parents are trying to meet the children's needs.Caregiver's Belief SystemsSome caregivers have belief systems that are inconsistent with Western medicine. A parent of a child who has a serious illness may decide to rely on untested remedies or alternative medicines. Some caregivers will seek healing through religion rather than medical care. The special case of religiously motivated medical neglect is discussed further below.The Child's Attitudes and BehaviorIn some cases, particularly in adolescents, the child will reject medical care and refuse to comply with medications, treatments, or diet. Children might assert their independence by not cooperating or use their illness to gain attention from their parents or deflect family conflict. Children may also be influenced by their peers and may not want to accept the fact they are ill and need treatment. They may feel they are more likely to “fit in” with others if they are not ill.Physician FactorsPediatricians' Misunderstanding of Different CulturesWhat some pediatricians may consider obvious medical neglect might be acceptable parenting practices in other cultures. It is important for pediatricians to have knowledge of the beliefs and practices of the families they serve. 6 If children are in danger, interventions necessary to protect them are indicated even if the parents think they are doing the right thing. However, pediatricians should work to understand others so they can effectively educate parents while respecting different cultures. Some American Indian/Alaska Native cultures actively encourage adolescent children to make their own decisions about medical care. If the adolescent makes a potentially harmful decision, the parents must be informed about the consequences of that decision and urged to intervene with the child, whether through persuasion or overruling the decision.Lack of Parent Health Literacy and Lack of Communication in the Medical SettingCommunication between pediatricians and parents can be affected by the parents' level of health literacy. Health literacy is defined by the US Department of Health and Human Services as “the degree to which individuals have capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.” 7 Parents often misunderstand complicated medical instructions and explanations of the justifications for treatment. Likewise, physicians may not clearly communicate or adequately assess caregivers' comprehension of complicated medical instructions and justifications for treatment. 8 This lack of understanding can lead to poor adherence by families. If parents and physicians do not speak the same language, this also can complicate communication. Pediatricians should be cognizant of the factors that limit effective communication with patients and parents and work to overcome those barriers. 9 The American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement “Ensuring Culturally Effective Pediatric Care” 10 provides excellent resources for pediatricians seeking information on cultural competency.THE PEDIATRICIAN′S RESPONSE TO MEDICAL NEGLECTWhen confronting a family in which a child is being medically neglected, the child's well-being should be the physician's first concern. Several management options are available to pediatricians. Generally, the least restrictive, most collaborative approach to the situation is the best. Whenever possible, the family should be assisted in understanding the need for obtaining necessary medical care. The management of medical neglect involves initially identifying the underlying problem that led to the neglect. Once this is done, the pediatrician has many options for rectifying the situation. The following suggested intervention options are listed from least restrictive to most restrictive.If the parents are not fluent in English, access services in the community to facilitate translation.Be sure the family's concerns are understood. The medical staff must understand the family's view of their child's medical condition and its proposed treatment. Recognizing the family as a partner in the decision-making process assures caregivers that their opinions are respected and opens the door to compromise and improved adherence.Counsel the family about the need for care and educate the parents and patient. The parents should be educated about the dangers of the illness and the importance of seeking medical care and complying with treatment. The family's support should be enlisted in addressing the problem. Make sure the parents understand what medications are indicated, how they work, and when they are to be given. Special programs are available to teach parents and children about the management of some chronic illnesses such as diabetes and asthma.In some cases, it will be helpful to expand the circle of caregivers who will help with the child's medical care. For example, the extended family of the child might be enlisted to assume some of the care responsibilities for the ill child.Involve the family in the development of a medical plan. When physicians collaborate with their patients in the development of treatment plans, physicians and families can reach shared understanding of the etiology, prognosis, and treatment options. Engaging the caregivers throughout the planning process can empower families and enlist them in support of treatment plans.When necessary, work with the family to develop a written contract that outlines exactly what care needs to be provided. Sometimes families have a difficult time keeping track of treatments, medications, and appointments, especially when they have a chronically ill child with complicated medical problems. A written contract that is agreed to by both the physician and the family can serve as a “blueprint” for the family to follow. It also provides the physician with documentation that the family understood and agreed to the care plan. If intervention is required later by social service agencies, this documentation can be helpful to demonstrate that the family was informed of the importance of the child's medical care. When contracting with families, physicians should make sure that the parents or caregivers can read and understand the care plan.Enlist community resources to aid in caring for the child. Resources such as visiting nurses, transportation services, financial relief, and respite care should be used if needed and available. Some organizations that advocate for people with specific chronic illnesses will provide educational opportunities about disease management, support groups, or “peer counselors.” Although organizing these interventions is often beyond the scope of pediatric practice, pediatricians should be aware of community resources that are available to support the families of their patients and be prepared to make appropriate referrals. The medical home must recruit and coordinate a multidisciplinary team to make decisions in complex cases of medical neglect. By gathering together the essential health and human services professionals involved in the case, treatment and rehabilitative regimens and services can be coordinated for the involved families. Enlist knowledgeable members from the family's cultural/ethnic/medical belief system to assist in understanding the actions of the family and to help the health and human services professionals meet the needs of the neglected child.Arrange for directly observed therapy for children with chronic serious illnesses. Daily home visits by a nurse or paraprofessional could be considered in cases in which there is lack of compliance with medications. Roberts et al 11 reported on the use of directly observed therapy to ensure that HIV-positive children received their antiretroviral therapy. In 4 of 6 cases, this approach led to sustained decreases in the patients' viral loads and allowed the children to remain in their homes instead of being placed in foster care. Although this is an expensive alternative, it is less expensive than providing foster care for a medically complicated child.A partial hospital or day-hospital program may be helpful in cases in which family dysfunction and lack of patient compliance are issues. In some areas, partial hospital programs offer medical and mental health care for chronically ill children. Such programs offer family, group, behavioral, and individual therapy as well as education for parents and children about coping with illness. 12 These programs, when available, are useful in treating children and families with complex histories in which chronic illness has been managed inadequately because of social and psychological factors.Refer families to child protective services agencies to ensure that necessary medical care is received. When other options are not available or have not been successful, it may be necessary to involve child protective services if the child is being harmed (or potentially harmed) by lack of medical care. The child protective services agency should understand what the nature of the child's medical problem is and why appropriate medical care is critical to the child's health and development. In many areas, the child protective services system has access to resources for family support that might not be available otherwise. In extreme cases in which the family is not able to cooperate, placing the child in foster care may be the only option.MEDICAL NEGLECT IN CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL HEALTH CARE NEEDSChildren with multiple medical problems can present a challenge to any parents. These children often require multiple regular medical appointments, multiple therapies such as physical, speech, and occupational therapy, medical equipment monitoring, special diets, and multiple medications. When the families of chronically ill children have limited resources, the challenges they present can be overwhelming. The primary care pediatrician can be helpful in providing a medical home that coordinates care and avoids duplication of services. A partnership with these families is critical so that problems can be identified and dealt with early. It is critical to always review the care plan so that the family can concentrate on therapies and interventions that are most likely to be beneficial and so that marginally effective therapies can be eliminated.SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITIES OF PEDIATRICIANS CARING FOR CHRONICALLY ILL CHILDREN WHO MISS MULTIPLE APPOINTMENTSSome parents with chronically ill children fail to keep multiple medical appointments. Depending on the seriousness of the child's illness, lack of medical care could adversely affect the child's health. In some cases, physicians inform such parents in writing that they will no longer be able to provide medical care for the child. When families tie up and then do not use scarce appointment slots, clinics are often unable to serve other families effectively. In other cases, clinic staff will contact the parents and simply reschedule the child for another appointment.In either case, pediatricians should consider whether the child is at risk of harm because of the acts of the parents. If so, other interventions should be considered, including asking a clinic social worker or other staff member to discuss the problem with the parents, requesting a home visit by a nurse, or, in extreme cases, referring the family to the local child protective services agency. The important point is that each case needs to be considered individually to ensure the well-being of each child.For chronically ill and complex patients, the medical home becomes an important asset in dealing with the competing demands for the caregivers' time and attention. In partnership with the families, primary care pediatricians can assist them in developing reasonable care plans involving many subspecialties and disciplines, such as physical and occupational therapy.Pediatricians should work with families to facilitate the availability of appointment times that meet the demands parents face, such as jobs, child care, and transportation.DETERMINING WHETHER A TREATMENT OFFERS SIGNIFICANT BENEFITOne of the 5 factors that constitute medical neglect is caregivers refusing recommended health care that offers significant “net benefit” to the child. In many cases, the question of net benefit of a therapeutic modality can be debated. For example, if parents refuse medical intervention for a newborn infant at the limit of viability, is it medical neglect? In many cases, we do not have data on the relative benefits of various therapeutic interventions, and in some cases what one person would deem beneficial, another might think is of no value.When these situations occur, it is important that the caregivers and health care professionals have an opportunity to communicate openly about their values and opinions. It is critical that these discussions be documented in the health record and acknowledged by providers and families. Involving a hospital's ethics committee can be helpful in resolving instances of conflicting opinions. 13RELIGIOUSLY MOTIVATED MEDICAL NEGLECTMedical neglect evaluations should focus on the child's needs rather than the caregiver's motivations or justifications. Religious objections, therefore, should not be granted fundamentally different status from other types of objections. 14Although competent adults have the right to refuse life-saving medical care for themselves, the US Supreme Court has stated that parents do not have the right to deny their children necessary medical care. 14 The court made this clear in 1944 in Prince v Massachusetts. 15 “The right to practice religion freely does not include the liberty to expose the community or child to communicable disease, or the latter to ill health or death. … Parents may be free to become martyrs themselves. But it does not follow they are free, in identical circumstances, to make martyrs of their children. …” 15 The American Academy of Pediatrics has taken a firm stance on the rights of seriously ill children to receive life-saving medical care even if their parents subscribe to religious beliefs that are antithetical to medical care. 16SUMMARYMedical neglect of children can cause harm or death. The pediatrician's responsibility is to the child. If parents or caregivers are not meeting the child's medical needs, the pediatrician is encouraged to work to ensure that the family has adequate resources to care for the child. The pediatrician has several important roles in working on behalf of medically neglected children, including engaging the family, understanding the family's circumstances, explaining the need for therapy, and collaborating with professionals and resources within the community to ensure that the child's health is optimized.COMMITTEE ON CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT, 2006–2007Carole Jenny, MD, MBA, ChairpersonCindy Christian, MD",2007/12/01,snopes,0
